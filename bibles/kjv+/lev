1:1 And the LORD 3068 called 7121-4 unto Moses, 4872 and spake 1696-17 unto him out of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation, 4150 saying, 559-2
1:2 Speak 1696-16 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and say 559-1 unto them, If any man 120 of you bring 7126-55 an offering 7133 unto the LORD, 3068 ye shall bring 7126-55 your offering 7133 of the cattle, 929 [even] of the herd, 1241 and of the flock. 6629
1:3 If his offering 7133 [be] a burnt sacrifice 5930 of the herd, 1241 let him offer 7126-55 a male 2145 without blemish: 8549 he shall offer 7126-55 it of his own voluntary will 7522 at the door 6607 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation 4150 before 6440 the LORD. 3068
1:4 And he shall put 5564-1 his hand 3027 upon the head 7218 of the burnt offering; 5930 and it shall be accepted 7521-8 for him to make atonement 3722-15 for him.
1:5 And he shall kill 7819-1 the bullock 1121 1241 before 6440 the LORD: 3068 and the priests, 3548 Aaron's 175 sons, 1121 shall bring 7126-52 the blood, 1818 and sprinkle 2236-1 the blood 1818 round about 5439 upon the altar 4196 that [is by] the door 6607 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation. 4150
1:6 And he shall flay 6584-52 the burnt offering, 5930 and cut 5408-14 it into his pieces. 5409
1:7 And the sons 1121 of Aaron 175 the priest 3548 shall put 5414-1 fire 784 upon the altar, 4196 and lay the wood 6086 in order 6186-1 upon the fire: 784
1:8 And the priests, 3548 Aaron's 175 sons, 1121 shall lay the parts, 5409 the head, 7218 and the fat, 6309 in order 6186-1 upon the wood 6086 that [is] on the fire 784 which [is] upon the altar: 4196
1:9 But his inwards 7130 and his legs 3767 shall he wash 7364-4 in water: 4325 and the priest 3548 shall burn 6999-52 all on the altar, 4196 [to be] a burnt sacrifice, 5930 an offering made by fire, 801 of a sweet 5207 savour 7381 unto the LORD. 3068
1:10 And if his offering 7133 [be] of the flocks, 6629 [namely], of the sheep, 3775 or of the goats, 5795 for a burnt sacrifice; 5930 he shall bring 7126-55 it a male 2145 without blemish. 8549
1:11 And he shall kill 7819-1 it on the side 3409 of the altar 4196 northward 6828 before 6440 the LORD: 3068 and the priests, 3548 Aaron's 175 sons, 1121 shall sprinkle 2236-1 his blood 1818 round about 5439 upon the altar. 4196
1:12 And he shall cut 5408-14 it into his pieces, 5409 with his head 7218 and his fat: 6309 and the priest 3548 shall lay them in order 6186-1 on the wood 6086 that [is] on the fire 784 which [is] upon the altar: 4196
1:13 But he shall wash 7364-4 the inwards 7130 and the legs 3767 with water: 4325 and the priest 3548 shall bring 7126-52 [it] all, and burn 6999-52 [it] upon the altar: 4196 it [is] a burnt sacrifice, 5930 an offering made by fire, 801 of a sweet 5207 savour 7381 unto the LORD. 3068
1:14 And if the burnt sacrifice 5930 for his offering 7133 to the LORD 3068 [be] of fowls, 5775 then he shall bring 7126-52 his offering 7133 of turtledoves, 8449 or of young 1121 pigeons. 3123
1:15 And the priest 3548 shall bring 7126-52 it unto the altar, 4196 and wring off 4454-1 his head, 7218 and burn 6999-52 [it] on the altar; 4196 and the blood 1818 thereof shall be wrung out 4680-8 at the side 7023 of the altar: 4196
1:16 And he shall pluck away 5493-52 his crop 4760 with his feathers, 5133 and cast 7993-52 it beside 681 the altar 4196 on the east part, 6924 by the place 4725 of the ashes: 1880
1:17 And he shall cleave 8156-14 it with the wings 3671 thereof, [but] shall not divide [it] asunder: 914-55 and the priest 3548 shall burn 6999-52 it upon the altar, 4196 upon the wood 6086 that [is] upon the fire: 784 it [is] a burnt sacrifice, 5930 an offering made by fire, 801 of a sweet 5207 savour 7381 unto the LORD. 3068
2:1 And when any 5315 will offer 7126-55 a meat 4503 offering 7133 unto the LORD, 3068 his offering 7133 shall be [of] fine flour; 5560 and he shall pour 3332-1 oil 8081 upon it, and put 5414-1 frankincense 3828 thereon:
2:2 And he shall bring 935-52 it to Aaron's 175 sons 1121 the priests: 3548 and he shall take 7061-1 thereout 8033 his handful 7062 4393 of the flour 5560 thereof, and of the oil 8081 thereof, with all the frankincense 3828 thereof; and the priest 3548 shall burn 6999-52 the memorial 234 of it upon the altar, 4196 [to be] an offering made by fire, 801 of a sweet 5207 savour 7381 unto the LORD: 3068
2:3 And the remnant 3498-12 of the meat offering 4503 [shall be] Aaron's 175 and his sons': 1121 [it is] a thing most 6944 holy 6944 of the offerings of the LORD 3068 made by fire. 801
2:4 And if thou bring 7126-55 an oblation 7133 of a meat offering 4503 baken 3989 in the oven, 8574 [it shall be] unleavened 4682 cakes 2471 of fine flour 5560 mingled 1101-7 with oil, 8081 or unleavened 4682 wafers 7550 anointed 4886-7 with oil. 8081

2:8 And thou shalt bring 935-52 the meat offering 4503 that is made 6213-11 of these things unto the LORD: 3068 and when it is presented 7126-52 unto the priest, 3548 he shall bring 5066-52 it unto the altar. 4196
2:9 And the priest 3548 shall take 7311-52 from the meat offering 4503 a memorial 234 thereof, and shall burn 6999-52 [it] upon the altar: 4196 [it is] an offering made by fire, 801 of a sweet 5207 savour 7381 unto the LORD. 3068
2:10 And that which is left 3498-12 of the meat offering 4503 [shall be] Aaron's 175 and his sons': 1121 [it is] a thing most 6944 holy 6944 of the offerings of the LORD 3068 made by fire. 801
2:11 No meat offering, 4503 which ye shall bring 7126-55 unto the LORD, 3068 shall be made 6213-11 with leaven: 2557 for ye shall burn 6999-55 no leaven, 7603 nor any honey, 1706 in any offering of the LORD 3068 made by fire. 801
2:12 As for the oblation 7133 of the firstfruits, 7225 ye shall offer 7126-55 them unto the LORD: 3068 but they shall not be burnt 5927-4 on the altar 4196 for a sweet 5207 savour. 7381
2:13 And every oblation 7133 of thy meat offering 4503 shalt thou season 4414-4 with salt; 4417 neither shalt thou suffer the salt 4417 of the covenant 1285 of thy God 430 to be lacking 7673-55 from thy meat offering: 4503 with all thine offerings 7133 thou shalt offer 7126-55 salt. 4417
2:14 And if thou offer 7126-55 a meat offering 4503 of thy firstfruits 1061 unto the LORD, 3068 thou shalt offer 7126-55 for the meat offering 4503 of thy firstfruits 1061 green ears of corn 24 dried 7033-7 by the fire, 784 [even] corn beaten 1643 out of full ears. 3759

3:2 And he shall lay 5564-1 his hand 3027 upon the head 7218 of his offering, 7133 and kill 7819-1 it [at] the door 6607 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation: 4150 and Aaron's 175 sons 1121 the priests 3548 shall sprinkle 2236-1 the blood 1818 upon the altar 4196 round about. 5439

3:4 And the two 8147 kidneys, 3629 and the fat 2459 that [is] on them, which [is] by the flanks, 3689 and the caul 3508 above the liver, 3516 with the kidneys, 3629 it shall he take away. 5493-55

3:8 And he shall lay 5564-1 his hand 3027 upon the head 7218 of his offering, 7133 and kill 7819-1 it before 6440 the tabernacle 168 of the congregation: 4150 and Aaron's 175 sons 1121 shall sprinkle 2236-1 the blood 1818 thereof round about 5439 upon the altar. 4196

3:9 And he shall offer 7126-52 of the sacrifice 2077 of the peace offering 8002 an offering made by fire 801 unto the LORD; 3068 the fat 2459 thereof, [and] the whole 8549 rump, 451 it shall he take off 5493-55 hard 5980 by the backbone; 6096 and the fat 2459 that covereth 3680-18 the inwards, 7130 and all the fat 2459 that [is] upon the inwards, 7130

3:10 And the two 8147 kidneys, 3629 and the fat 2459 that [is] upon them, which [is] by the flanks, 3689 and the caul 3508 above the liver, 3516 with the kidneys, 3629 it shall he take away. 5493-55

3:11 And the priest 3548 shall burn 6999-52 it upon the altar: 4196 [it is] the food 3899 of the offering made by fire 801 unto the LORD. 3068

3:12 And if his offering 7133 [be] a goat, 5795 then he shall offer 7126-52 it before 6440 the LORD. 3068

3:13 And he shall lay 5564-1 his hand 3027 upon the head 7218 of it, and kill 7819-1 it before 6440 the tabernacle 168 of the congregation: 4150 and the sons 1121 of Aaron 175 shall sprinkle 2236-1 the blood 1818 thereof upon the altar 4196 round about. 5439

3:15 And the two 8147 kidneys, 3629 and the fat 2459 that [is] upon them, which [is] by the flanks, 3689 and the caul 3508 above the liver, 3516 with the kidneys, 3629 it shall he take away. 5493-55

3:16 And the priest 3548 shall burn 6999-52 them upon the altar: 4196 [it is] the food 3899 of the offering made by fire 801 for a sweet 5207 savour: 7381 all the fat 2459 [is] the LORD'S. 3068

3:17 [It shall be] a perpetual 5769 statute 2708 for your generations 1755 throughout all your dwellings, 4186 that ye eat 398-4 neither fat 2459 nor blood. 1818

4:1 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

4:2 Speak 1696-16 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 saying, 559-2 If a soul 5315 shall sin 2398-4 through ignorance 7684 against any of the commandments 4687 of the LORD 3068 [concerning things] which ought not to be done, 6213-11 and shall do 6213-1 against any 259 of them: 2007

4:3 If the priest 3548 that is anointed 4899 do sin 2398-4 according to the sin 819 of the people; 5971 then let him bring 7126-52 for his sin, 2403 which he hath sinned, 2398-1 a young 6499 1121 bullock 1241 without blemish 8549 unto the LORD 3068 for a sin offering. 2403

4:4 And he shall bring 935-52 the bullock 6499 unto the door 6607 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation 4150 before 6440 the LORD; 3068 and shall lay 5564-1 his hand 3027 upon the bullock's 6499 head, 7218 and kill 7819-1 the bullock 6499 before 6440 the LORD. 3068

4:6 And the priest 3548 shall dip 2881-1 his finger 676 in the blood, 1818 and sprinkle 5137-52 of the blood 1818 seven 7651 times 6471 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 before 6440 the vail 6532 of the sanctuary. 6944

4:7 And the priest 3548 shall put 5414-1 [some] of the blood 1818 upon the horns 7161 of the altar 4196 of sweet 5561 incense 7004 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 which [is] in the tabernacle 168 of the congregation; 4150 and shall pour 8210-4 all the blood 1818 of the bullock 6499 at the bottom 3247 of the altar 4196 of the burnt offering, 5930 which [is at] the door 6607 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation. 4150

4:8 And he shall take off 7311-55 from it all the fat 2459 of the bullock 6499 for the sin offering; 2403 the fat 2459 that covereth 3680-18 the inwards, 7130 and all the fat 2459 that [is] upon the inwards, 7130

4:9 And the two 8147 kidneys, 3629 and the fat 2459 that [is] upon them, which [is] by the flanks, 3689 and the caul 3508 above the liver, 3516 with the kidneys, 3629 it shall he take away, 5493-55

4:10 As it was taken off 7311-93 from the bullock 7794 of the sacrifice 2077 of peace offerings: 8002 and the priest 3548 shall burn 6999-52 them upon the altar 4196 of the burnt offering. 5930

4:11 And the skin 5785 of the bullock, 6499 and all his flesh, 1320 with his head, 7218 and with his legs, 3767 and his inwards, 7130 and his dung, 6569

4:12 Even the whole bullock 6499 shall he carry forth 3318-52 without 2351 the camp 4264 unto a clean 2889 place, 4725 where 413 the ashes 1880 are poured out, 8211 and burn 8313-1 him on the wood 6086 with fire: 784 where the ashes 1880 are poured out 8211 shall he be burnt. 8313-11

4:13 And if the whole congregation 5712 of Israel 3478 sin through ignorance, 7686-4 and the thing 1697 be hid 5956-8 from the eyes 5869 of the assembly, 6951 and they have done 6213-1 [somewhat against] any 259 of the commandments 4687 of the LORD 3068 [concerning things] which should not be done, 6213-11 and are guilty; 816-1

4:14 When the sin, 2403 which they have sinned 2398-1 against it, is known, 3045-8 then the congregation 6951 shall offer 7126-52 a young 6499 1121 bullock 1241 for the sin, 2403 and bring 935-52 him before 6440 the tabernacle 168 of the congregation. 4150

4:15 And the elders 2205 of the congregation 5712 shall lay 5564-1 their hands 3027 upon the head 7218 of the bullock 6499 before 6440 the LORD: 3068 and the bullock 6499 shall be killed 7819-1 before 6440 the LORD. 3068

4:16 And the priest 3548 that is anointed 4899 shall bring 935-52 of the bullock's 6499 blood 1818 to the tabernacle 168 of the congregation: 4150

4:17 And the priest 3548 shall dip 2881-1 his finger 676 [in some] of the blood, 1818 and sprinkle 5137-52 [it] seven 7651 times 6471 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 [even] before 6440 the vail. 6532

4:18 And he shall put 5414-4 [some] of the blood 1818 upon the horns 7161 of the altar 4196 which [is] before 6440 the LORD, 3068 that [is] in the tabernacle 168 of the congregation, 4150 and shall pour out 8210-4 all the blood 1818 at the bottom 3247 of the altar 4196 of the burnt offering, 5930 which [is at] the door 6607 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation. 4150

4:19 And he shall take 7311-55 all his fat 2459 from him, and burn 6999-52 [it] upon the altar. 4196

4:20 And he shall do 6213-1 with the bullock 6499 as he did 6213-1 with the bullock 6499 for a sin offering, 2403 so shall he do 6213-4 with this: and the priest 3548 shall make an atonement 3722-14 for them, and it shall be forgiven 5545-8 them.

4:21 And he shall carry forth 3318-52 the bullock 6499 without 2351 the camp, 4264 and burn 8313-1 him as he burned 8313-1 the first 7223 bullock: 6499 it [is] a sin offering 2403 for the congregation. 6951

4:22 When a ruler 5387 hath sinned, 2398-4 and done 6213-1 [somewhat] through ignorance 7684 [against] any 259 of the commandments 4687 of the LORD 3068 his God 430 [concerning things] which should not be done, 6213-11 and is guilty; 816-1

4:23 Or if his sin, 2403 wherein he hath sinned, 2398-1 come to his knowledge; 3045-90 he shall bring 935-52 his offering, 7133 a kid 8163 of the goats, 5795 a male 2145 without blemish: 8549

4:24 And he shall lay 5564-1 his hand 3027 upon the head 7218 of the goat, 8163 and kill 7819-1 it in the place 4725 where they kill 7819-4 the burnt offering 5930 before 6440 the LORD: 3068 it [is] a sin offering. 2403

4:25 And the priest 3548 shall take 3947-1 of the blood 1818 of the sin offering 2403 with his finger, 676 and put 5414-1 [it] upon the horns 7161 of the altar 4196 of burnt offering, 5930 and shall pour out 8210-4 his blood 1818 at the bottom 3247 of the altar 4196 of burnt offering. 5930

4:26 And he shall burn 6999-55 all his fat 2459 upon the altar, 4196 as the fat 2459 of the sacrifice 2077 of peace offerings: 8002 and the priest 3548 shall make an atonement 3722-14 for him as concerning his sin, 2403 and it shall be forgiven 5545-8 him.

4:27 And if any 259 one 5315 of the common 776 people 5971 sin 2398-4 through ignorance, 7684 while he doeth 6213-2 [somewhat against] any 259 of the commandments 4687 of the LORD 3068 [concerning things] which ought not to be done, 6213-11 and be guilty; 816-1

4:28 Or if his sin, 2403 which he hath sinned, 2398-1 come to his knowledge: 3045-90 then he shall bring 935-52 his offering, 7133 a kid 8166 of the goats, 5795 a female 5347 without blemish, 8549 for his sin 2403 which he hath sinned. 2398-1

4:29 And he shall lay 5564-1 his hand 3027 upon the head 7218 of the sin offering, 2403 and slay 7819-1 the sin offering 2403 in the place 4725 of the burnt offering. 5930

4:30 And the priest 3548 shall take 3947-1 of the blood 1818 thereof with his finger, 676 and put 5414-1 [it] upon the horns 7161 of the altar 4196 of burnt offering, 5930 and shall pour out 8210-4 all the blood 1818 thereof at the bottom 3247 of the altar. 4196

4:31 And he shall take away 5493-55 all the fat 2459 thereof, as the fat 2459 is taken away 5493-90 from off the sacrifice 2077 of peace offerings; 8002 and the priest 3548 shall burn 6999-52 [it] upon the altar 4196 for a sweet 5207 savour 7381 unto the LORD; 3068 and the priest 3548 shall make an atonement 3722-14 for him, and it shall be forgiven 5545-8 him.

4:32 And if he bring 935-55 a lamb 3532 for a sin 2403 offering, 7133 he shall bring 935-55 it a female 5347 without blemish. 8549

4:33 And he shall lay 5564-1 his hand 3027 upon the head 7218 of the sin offering, 2403 and slay 7819-1 it for a sin offering 2403 in the place 4725 where they kill 7819-4 the burnt offering. 5930

4:34 And the priest 3548 shall take 3947-1 of the blood 1818 of the sin offering 2403 with his finger, 676 and put 5414-1 [it] upon the horns 7161 of the altar 4196 of burnt offering, 5930 and shall pour out 8210-4 all the blood 1818 thereof at the bottom 3247 of the altar: 4196

4:35 And he shall take away 5493-55 all the fat 2459 thereof, as the fat 2459 of the lamb 3775 is taken away 5493-93 from the sacrifice 2077 of the peace offerings; 8002 and the priest 3548 shall burn 6999-52 them upon the altar, 4196 according to the offerings made by fire 801 unto the LORD: 3068 and the priest 3548 shall make an atonement 3722-14 for his sin 2403 that he hath committed, 2398-1 and it shall be forgiven 5545-8 him.

5:1 And if a soul 5315 sin, 2398-4 and hear 8085-1 the voice 6963 of swearing, 423 and [is] a witness, 5707 whether 176 he hath seen 7200-1 or 176 known 3045-1 [of it]; if he do not utter 5046-55 [it], then he shall bear 5375-1 his iniquity. 5771

5:2 Or if a soul 5315 touch 5060-4 any unclean 2931 thing, 1697 whether [it be] a carcase 5038 of an unclean 2931 beast, 2416 or a carcase 5038 of unclean 2931 cattle, 929 or the carcase 5038 of unclean 2931 creeping things, 8318 and [if] it be hidden 5956-8 from him; he also shall be unclean, 2931 and guilty. 816-1

5:3 Or if he touch 5060-4 the uncleanness 2932 of man, 120 whatsoever uncleanness 2932 [it be] that a man shall be defiled 2930-4 withal, and it be hid 5956-8 from him; when he knoweth 3045-1 [of it], then he shall be guilty. 816-1

5:4 Or if a soul 5315 swear, 7650-11 pronouncing 981-15 with [his] lips 8193 to do evil, 7489-53 or to do good, 3190-53 whatsoever [it be] that a man 120 shall pronounce 981-17 with an oath, 7621 and it be hid 5956-8 from him; when he knoweth 3045-1 [of it], then he shall be guilty 816-1 in one 259 of these.

5:5 And it shall be, when he shall be guilty 816-4 in one 259 of these [things], that he shall confess 3034-98 that he hath sinned 2398-1 in that [thing]:

5:6 And he shall bring 935-52 his trespass offering 817 unto the LORD 3068 for his sin 2403 which he hath sinned, 2398-1 a female 5347 from the flock, 6629 a lamb 3776 or a kid 8166 of the goats, 5795 for a sin offering; 2403 and the priest 3548 shall make an atonement 3722-14 for him concerning his sin. 2403

5:7 And if he 3027 be not able 1767 to bring 5060-55 a lamb, 7716 then he shall bring 935-52 for 854 his trespass, 817 which he hath committed, 2398-1 two 8147 turtledoves, 8449 or two 8147 young 1121 pigeons, 3123 unto the LORD; 3068 one 259 for a sin offering, 2403 and the other 259 for a burnt offering. 5930

5:8 And he shall bring 935-52 them unto the priest, 3548 who shall offer 7126-52 [that] which [is] for the sin offering 2403 first, 7223 and wring off 4454-1 his head 7218 from 4136 his neck, 6203 but shall not divide [it] asunder: 914-55

5:9 And he shall sprinkle 5137-52 of the blood 1818 of the sin offering 2403 upon the side 7023 of the altar; 4196 and the rest 7604-12 of the blood 1818 shall be wrung out 4680-11 at the bottom 3247 of the altar: 4196 it [is] a sin offering. 2403

5:10 And he shall offer 6213-4 the second 8145 [for] a burnt offering, 5930 according to the manner: 4941 and the priest 3548 shall make an atonement 3722-14 for him for his sin 2403 which he hath sinned, 2398-1 and it shall be forgiven 5545-8 him.

5:11 But if he 3027 be not able to bring 5381-55 two 8147 turtledoves, 8449 or two 8147 young 1121 pigeons, 3123 then he that sinned 2398-1 shall bring 935-52 for his offering 7133 the tenth 6224 part of an ephah 374 of fine flour 5560 for a sin offering; 2403 he shall put 7760-4 no oil 8081 upon it, neither shall he put 5414-4 [any] frankincense 3828 thereon: for it [is] a sin offering. 2403

5:12 Then shall he bring 935-52 it to the priest, 3548 and the priest 3548 shall take 7061-1 his handful 4393 7062 of it, [even] a memorial 234 thereof, and burn 6999-52 [it] on the altar, 4196 according to the offerings made by fire 801 unto the LORD: 3068 it [is] a sin offering. 2403

5:13 And the priest 3548 shall make an atonement 3722-14 for him as touching his sin 2403 that he hath sinned 2398-1 in one 259 of these, and it shall be forgiven 5545-8 him: and [the remnant] shall be the priest's, 3548 as a meat offering. 4503

5:14 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

5:15 If a soul 5315 commit 4603-4 a trespass, 4604 and sin 2398-1 through ignorance, 7684 in the holy things 6944 of the LORD; 3068 then he shall bring 935-52 for his trespass 817 unto the LORD 3068 a ram 352 without blemish 8549 out of the flocks, 6629 with thy estimation 6187 by shekels 8255 of silver, 3701 after the shekel 8255 of the sanctuary, 6944 for a trespass offering: 817

5:16 And he shall make amends 7999-17 for the harm 2398-1 that he hath done in the holy thing, 6944 and shall add 3254-55 the fifth part 2549 thereto, and give 5414-1 it unto the priest: 3548 and the priest 3548 shall make an atonement 3722-17 for him with the ram 352 of the trespass offering, 817 and it shall be forgiven 5545-8 him.

5:17 And if a soul 5315 sin, 2398-4 and commit 6213-1 any 259 of these things which are forbidden to be done 6213-11 by the commandments 4687 of the LORD; 3068 though he wist 3045-1 [it] not, yet is he guilty, 816-1 and shall bear 5375-1 his iniquity. 5771

5:18 And he shall bring 935-52 a ram 352 without blemish 8549 out of the flock, 6629 with thy estimation, 6187 for a trespass offering, 817 unto the priest: 3548 and the priest 3548 shall make an atonement 3722-14 for him concerning his ignorance 7684 wherein he erred 7683-1 and wist 3045-1 [it] not, and it shall be forgiven 5545-8 him.

5:19 It [is] a trespass offering: 817 he hath certainly 816-2 trespassed 816-1 against the LORD. 3068

6:1 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

6:2 If a soul 5315 sin, 2398-4 and commit 4603-1 a trespass 4604 against the LORD, 3068 and lie 3584-14 unto his neighbour 5997 in that which was delivered 6487 him to keep, or in fellowship, 8667 3027 or in a thing taken away by violence, 1498 or hath deceived 6231-1 his neighbour; 5997

6:3 Or have found 4672-1 that which was lost, 9 and lieth 3584-14 concerning it, and sweareth 7650-8 falsely; 8267 in any 259 of all these that a man 120 doeth, 6213-4 sinning 2398-2 therein: 2007

6:4 Then it shall be, because he hath sinned, 2398-4 and is guilty, 816-1 that he shall restore 7725-52 that 1500 which he took violently away, 1497-1 or the thing 6233 which he hath deceitfully gotten, 6231-1 or that which was delivered 6485-90 him 853 to keep, 6487 or the lost thing 9 which he found, 4672-1

6:5 Or all that about which he hath sworn 7650-11 falsely; 8267 he shall even restore 7999-14 it in the principal, 7218 and shall add 3254-55 the fifth part 2549 more thereto, [and] give 5414-4 it unto him to whom it appertaineth, in the day 3117 of his trespass offering. 819

6:6 And he shall bring 935-55 his trespass offering 817 unto the LORD, 3068 a ram 352 without blemish 8549 out of the flock, 6629 with thy estimation, 6187 for a trespass offering, 817 unto the priest: 3548

6:7 And the priest 3548 shall make an atonement 3722-14 for him before 6440 the LORD: 3068 and it shall be forgiven 5545-8 him for any thing 259 of all that he hath done 6213-4 in trespassing 819 therein.

6:8 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

6:9 Command 6680-16 Aaron 175 and his sons, 1121 saying, 559-2 This [is] the law 8451 of the burnt offering: 5930 It [is] the burnt offering, 5930 because of the burning 4169 upon the altar 4196 all night 3915 unto the morning, 1242 and the fire 784 of the altar 4196 shall be burning 3344-93 in it.

6:10 And the priest 3548 shall put on 3847-1 his linen 906 garment, 4055 and his linen 906 breeches 4370 shall he put 3847-4 upon his flesh, 1320 and take up 7311-52 the ashes 1880 which the fire 784 hath consumed 398-4 with the burnt offering 5930 on the altar, 4196 and he shall put 7760-1 them beside 681 the altar. 4196

6:11 And he shall put off 6584-1 his garments, 899 and put on 3847-1 other 312 garments, 899 and carry forth 3318-52 the ashes 1880 without 2351 the camp 4264 unto a clean 2889 place. 4725

6:12 And the fire 784 upon the altar 4196 shall be burning 3344-93 in it; it shall not be put out: 3518-4 and the priest 3548 shall burn 1197-14 wood 6086 on it every morning, 1242 1242 and lay the burnt offering 5930 in order 6186-1 upon it; and he shall burn 6999-52 thereon the fat 2459 of the peace offerings. 8002

6:13 The fire 784 shall ever 8548 be burning 3344-93 upon the altar; 4196 it shall never go out. 3518-4

6:14 And this [is] the law 8451 of the meat offering: 4503 the sons 1121 of Aaron 175 shall offer 7126-54 it before 6440 the LORD, 3068 before 6440 the altar. 4196

6:15 And he shall take 7311-52 of it his handful, 7062 of the flour 5560 of the meat offering, 4503 and of the oil 8081 thereof, and all the frankincense 3828 which [is] upon the meat offering, 4503 and shall burn 6999-52 [it] upon the altar 4196 [for] a sweet 5207 savour, 7381 [even] the memorial 234 of it, unto the LORD. 3068

6:16 And the remainder 3498-12 thereof shall Aaron 175 and his sons 1121 eat: 398-4 with unleavened bread 4682 shall it be eaten 398-11 in the holy 6918 place; 4725 in the court 2691 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation 4150 they shall eat 398-4 it.

6:17 It shall not be baken 644-11 with leaven. 2557 I have given 5414-1 it [unto them for] their portion 2506 of my offerings made by fire; 801 it [is] most 6944 holy, 6944 as [is] the sin offering, 2403 and as the trespass offering. 817

6:18 All the males 2145 among the children 1121 of Aaron 175 shall eat 398-4 of it. [It shall be] a statute 2706 for ever 5769 in your generations 1755 concerning the offerings of the LORD 3068 made by fire: 801 every one that toucheth 5060-4 them shall be holy. 6942-4

6:19 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

6:20 This [is] the offering 7133 of Aaron 175 and of his sons, 1121 which they shall offer 7126-55 unto the LORD 3068 in the day 3117 when he is anointed; 4886-9 the tenth 6224 part of an ephah 374 of fine flour 5560 for a meat offering 4503 perpetual, 8548 half 4276 of it in the morning, 1242 and half 4276 thereof at night. 6153

6:21 In a pan 4227 it shall be made 6213-11 with oil; 8081 [and when it is] baken, 7246-94 thou shalt bring it in: 935-55 [and] the baken 8601 pieces 6595 of the meat offering 4503 shalt thou offer 7126-55 [for] a sweet 5207 savour 7381 unto the LORD. 3068

6:22 And the priest 3548 of his sons 1121 that is anointed 4899 in his stead shall offer 6213-4 it: [it is] a statute 2706 for ever 5769 unto the LORD; 3068 it shall be wholly 3632 burnt. 6999-93

6:23 For every meat offering 4503 for the priest 3548 shall be wholly 3632 burnt: it shall not be eaten. 398-11

6:24 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

6:25 Speak 1696-16 unto Aaron 175 and to his sons, 1121 saying, 559-2 This [is] the law 8451 of the sin offering: 2403 In the place 4725 where the burnt offering 5930 is killed 7819-11 shall the sin offering 2403 be killed 7819-11 before 6440 the LORD: 3068 it [is] most 6944 holy. 6944

6:26 The priest 3548 that offereth it for sin 2398-18 shall eat 398-4 it: in the holy 6918 place 4725 shall it be eaten, 398-11 in the court 2691 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation. 4150

6:27 Whatsoever shall touch 5060-4 the flesh 1320 thereof shall be holy: 6942-4 and when there is sprinkled 5137-4 of the blood 1818 thereof upon any garment, 899 thou shalt wash 3526-17 that whereon it was sprinkled 5137-4 in the holy 6918 place. 4725

6:28 But the earthen 2789 vessel 3627 wherein it is sodden 1310-29 shall be broken: 7665-11 and if it be sodden 1310-27 in a brasen 5178 pot, 3627 it shall be both scoured, 4838-27 and rinsed 7857-27 in water. 4325

6:29 All the males 2145 among the priests 3548 shall eat 398-4 thereof: it [is] most 6944 holy. 6944

6:30 And no sin offering, 2403 whereof [any] of the blood 1818 is brought 935-93 into the tabernacle 168 of the congregation 4150 to reconcile 3722-15 [withal] in the holy 6944 [place], shall be eaten: 398-11 it shall be burnt 8313-11 in the fire. 784

7:1 Likewise this [is] the law 8451 of the trespass offering: 817 it [is] most 6944 holy. 6944

7:2 In the place 4725 where they kill 7819-4 the burnt offering 5930 shall they kill 7819-4 the trespass offering: 817 and the blood 1818 thereof shall he sprinkle 2236-4 round about 5439 upon the altar. 4196

7:3 And he shall offer 7126-55 of it all the fat 2459 thereof; the rump, 451 and the fat 2459 that covereth 3680-18 the inwards, 7130

7:4 And the two 8147 kidneys, 3629 and the fat 2459 that [is] on them, which [is] by the flanks, 3689 and the caul 3508 [that is] above the liver, 3516 with the kidneys, 3629 it shall he take away: 5493-55

7:5 And the priest 3548 shall burn 6999-52 them upon the altar 4196 [for] an offering made by fire 801 unto the LORD: 3068 it [is] a trespass offering. 817

7:6 Every male 2145 among the priests 3548 shall eat 398-4 thereof: it shall be eaten 398-11 in the holy 6918 place: 4725 it [is] most 6944 holy. 6944

7:7 As the sin offering 2403 [is], so [is] the trespass offering: 817 [there is] one 259 law 8451 for them: the priest 3548 that maketh atonement 3722-17 therewith shall have [it].

7:8 And the priest 3548 that offereth 7126-56 any man's 376 burnt offering, 5930 [even] the priest 3548 shall have to himself the skin 5785 of the burnt offering 5930 which he hath offered. 7126-52

7:9 And all the meat offering 4503 that is baken 644-11 in the oven, 8574 and all that is dressed 6213-8 in the fryingpan, 4802 and in the pan, 4227 shall be the priest's 3548 that offereth 7126-56 it.

7:10 And every meat offering, 4503 mingled 1101-7 with oil, 8081 and dry, 2720 shall all the sons 1121 of Aaron 175 have, one 376 [as much] as another. 251

7:11 And this [is] the law 8451 of the sacrifice 2077 of peace offerings, 8002 which he shall offer 7126-55 unto the LORD. 3068

7:12 If he offer 7126-55 it for a thanksgiving, 8426 then he shall offer 7126-52 with the sacrifice 2077 of thanksgiving 8426 unleavened 4682 cakes 2471 mingled 1101-7 with oil, 8081 and unleavened 4682 wafers 7550 anointed 4886-7 with oil, 8081 and cakes 2471 mingled 1101-7 with oil, 8081 of fine flour, 5560 fried. 7246-94

7:13 Besides the cakes, 2471 he shall offer 7126-55 [for] his offering 7133 leavened 2557 bread 3899 with the sacrifice 2077 of thanksgiving 8426 of his peace offerings. 8002

7:14 And of it he shall offer 7126-52 one 259 out of the whole oblation 7133 [for] an heave offering 8641 unto the LORD, 3068 [and] it shall be the priest's 3548 that sprinkleth 2236-6 the blood 1818 of the peace offerings. 8002

7:15 And the flesh 1320 of the sacrifice 2077 of his peace offerings 8002 for thanksgiving 8426 shall be eaten 398-11 the same day 3117 that it is offered; 7133 he shall not leave 3240-55 any of it until the morning. 1242

7:16 But if the sacrifice 2077 of his offering 7133 [be] a vow, 5088 or a voluntary offering, 5071 it shall be eaten 398-11 the same day 3117 that he offereth 7126-53 his sacrifice: 2077 and on the morrow 4283 also the remainder 3498-12 of it shall be eaten: 398-11

7:17 But the remainder 3498-12 of the flesh 1320 of the sacrifice 2077 on the third 7992 day 3117 shall be burnt 8313-11 with fire. 784

7:18 And if [any] of the flesh 1320 of the sacrifice 2077 of his peace offerings 8002 be eaten 398-11 at all 398-9 on the third 7992 day, 3117 it shall not be accepted, 7521-11 neither shall it be imputed 2803-11 unto him that offereth 7126-56 it: it shall be an abomination, 6292 and the soul 5315 that eateth 398-6 of it shall bear 5375-4 his iniquity. 5771

7:19 And the flesh 1320 that toucheth 5060-4 any unclean 2931 [thing] shall not be eaten; 398-11 it shall be burnt 8313-11 with fire: 784 and as for the flesh, 1320 all that be clean 2889 shall eat 398-4 thereof. 1320

7:20 But the soul 5315 that eateth 398-4 [of] the flesh 1320 of the sacrifice 2077 of peace offerings, 8002 that [pertain] unto the LORD, 3068 having his uncleanness 2932 upon him, even that soul 5315 shall be cut off 3772-8 from his people. 5971

7:21 Moreover the soul 5315 that shall touch 5060-4 any unclean 2931 [thing, as] the uncleanness 2932 of man, 120 or [any] unclean 2931 beast, 929 or any abominable 8263 unclean 2931 [thing], and eat 398-1 of the flesh 1320 of the sacrifice 2077 of peace offerings, 8002 which [pertain] unto the LORD, 3068 even that soul 5315 shall be cut off 3772-8 from his people. 5971

7:22 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

7:23 Speak 1696-16 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 saying, 559-2 Ye shall eat 398-4 no manner of fat, 2459 of ox, 7794 or of sheep, 3775 or of goat. 5795

7:24 And the fat 2459 of the beast that dieth of itself, 5038 and the fat 2459 of that which is torn with beasts, 2966 may be used 6213-11 in any other use: 4399 but ye shall in no wise 398-2 eat 398-4 of it.

7:25 For whosoever eateth 398-6 the fat 2459 of the beast, 929 of which men offer 7126-55 an offering made by fire 801 unto the LORD, 3068 even the soul 5315 that eateth 398-6 [it] shall be cut off 3772-8 from his people. 5971

7:26 Moreover ye shall eat 398-4 no manner of blood, 1818 [whether it be] of fowl 5775 or of beast, 929 in any of your dwellings. 4186

7:27 Whatsoever soul 5315 [it be] that eateth 398-4 any manner 3605 of blood, 1818 even that soul 5315 shall be cut off 3772-8 from his people. 5971

7:28 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

7:29 Speak 1696-16 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 saying, 559-2 He that offereth 7126-56 the sacrifice 2077 of his peace offerings 8002 unto the LORD 3068 shall bring 935-55 his oblation 7133 unto the LORD 3068 of the sacrifice 2077 of his peace offerings. 8002

7:30 His own hands 3027 shall bring 935-55 the offerings of the LORD 3068 made by fire, 801 the fat 2459 with the breast, 2373 it shall he bring, 935-55 that the breast 2373 may be waved 5130-53 [for] a wave offering 8573 before 6440 the LORD. 3068

7:31 And the priest 3548 shall burn 6999-52 the fat 2459 upon the altar: 4196 but the breast 2373 shall be Aaron's 175 and his sons'. 1121

7:32 And the right 3225 shoulder 7785 shall ye give 5414-4 unto the priest 3548 [for] an heave offering 8641 of the sacrifices 2077 of your peace offerings. 8002

7:33 He among the sons 1121 of Aaron, 175 that offereth 7126-56 the blood 1818 of the peace offerings, 8002 and the fat, 2459 shall have the right 3225 shoulder 7785 for [his] part. 4490

7:34 For the wave 8573 breast 2373 and the heave 8641 shoulder 7785 have I taken 3947-1 of the children 1121 of Israel 3478 from off the sacrifices 2077 of their peace offerings, 8002 and have given 5414-4 them unto Aaron 175 the priest 3548 and unto his sons 1121 by a statute 2706 for ever 5769 from among the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

7:35 This [is the portion] of the anointing 4888 of Aaron, 175 and of the anointing 4888 of his sons, 1121 out of the offerings of the LORD 3068 made by fire, 801 in the day 3117 [when] he presented 7126-52 them to minister unto the LORD 3068 in the priest's office; 3547-15

7:36 Which the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 to be given 5414-2 them of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 in the day 3117 that he anointed 4886-2 them, [by] a statute 2708 for ever 5769 throughout their generations. 1755

7:37 This [is] the law 8451 of the burnt offering, 5930 of the meat offering, 4503 and of the sin offering, 2403 and of the trespass offering, 817 and of the consecrations, 4394 and of the sacrifice 2077 of the peace offerings; 8002

7:38 Which the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses 4872 in mount 2022 Sinai, 5514 in the day 3117 that he commanded 6680-15 the children 1121 of Israel 3478 to offer 7126-53 their oblations 7133 unto the LORD, 3068 in the wilderness 4057 of Sinai. 5514

8:1 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

8:2 Take 3947-3 Aaron 175 and his sons 1121 with him, and the garments, 899 and the anointing 4888 oil, 8081 and a bullock 6499 for the sin offering, 2403 and two 8147 rams, 352 and a basket 5536 of unleavened bread; 4682

8:3 And gather thou all the congregation 5712 together 6950-54 unto the door 6607 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation. 4150

8:4 And Moses 4872 did 6213-4 as the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 him; and the assembly 5712 was gathered together 6950-11 unto the door 6607 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation. 4150

8:5 And Moses 4872 said 559-4 unto the congregation, 5712 This [is] the thing 1697 which the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 to be done. 6213-2

8:6 And Moses 4872 brought 7126-55 Aaron 175 and his sons, 1121 and washed 7364-4 them with water. 4325

8:7 And he put 5414-4 upon him the coat, 3801 and girded 2296-4 him with the girdle, 73 and clothed 3847-55 him with the robe, 4598 and put 5414-4 the ephod 646 upon him, and he girded 2296-4 him with the curious girdle 2805 of the ephod, 646 and bound 640-4 [it] unto him therewith.

8:8 And he put 7760-4 the breastplate 2833 upon him: also he put 5414-4 in the breastplate 2833 the Urim 224 and the Thummim. 8550

8:9 And he put 7760-4 the mitre 4701 upon his head; 7218 also upon the mitre, 4701 [even] upon his forefront, 6440 4136 did he put 7760-4 the golden 2091 plate, 6731 the holy 6944 crown; 5145 as the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses. 4872

8:10 And Moses 4872 took 3947-4 the anointing 4888 oil, 8081 and anointed 4886-4 the tabernacle 4908 and all that [was] therein, and sanctified 6942-17 them.

8:11 And he sprinkled 5137-55 thereof upon the altar 4196 seven 7651 times, 6471 and anointed 4886-4 the altar 4196 and all his vessels, 3627 both the laver 3595 and his foot, 3653 to sanctify 6942-15 them.

8:12 And he poured 3332-4 of the anointing 4888 oil 8081 upon Aaron's 175 head, 7218 and anointed 4886-4 him, to sanctify 6942-15 him.

8:13 And Moses 4872 brought 7126-55 Aaron's 175 sons, 1121 and put 3847-55 coats 3801 upon them, and girded 2296-4 them with girdles, 73 and put 2280-4 bonnets 4021 upon them; as the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses. 4872

8:14 And he brought 5066-55 the bullock 6499 for the sin offering: 2403 and Aaron 175 and his sons 1121 laid 5564-4 their hands 3027 upon the head 7218 of the bullock 6499 for the sin offering. 2403

8:15 And he slew 7819-4 [it]; and Moses 4872 took 3947-4 the blood, 1818 and put 5414-4 [it] upon the horns 7161 of the altar 4196 round about 5439 with his finger, 676 and purified 2398-17 the altar, 4196 and poured 3332-1 the blood 1818 at the bottom 3247 of the altar, 4196 and sanctified 6942-17 it, to make reconciliation 3722-15 upon it.

8:16 And he took 3947-4 all the fat 2459 that [was] upon the inwards, 7130 and the caul 3508 [above] the liver, 3516 and the two 8147 kidneys, 3629 and their fat, 2459 and Moses 4872 burned 6999-55 [it] upon the altar. 4196

8:17 But the bullock, 6499 and his hide, 5785 his flesh, 1320 and his dung, 6569 he burnt 8313-1 with fire 784 without 2351 the camp; 4264 as the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses. 4872

8:18 And he brought 7126-55 the ram 352 for the burnt offering: 5930 and Aaron 175 and his sons 1121 laid 5564-4 their hands 3027 upon the head 7218 of the ram. 352

8:19 And he killed 7819-4 [it]; and Moses 4872 sprinkled 2236-4 the blood 1818 upon the altar 4196 round about. 5439

8:20 And he cut 5408-14 the ram 352 into pieces; 5409 and Moses 4872 burnt 6999-55 the head, 7218 and the pieces, 5409 and the fat. 6309

8:21 And he washed 7364-1 the inwards 7130 and the legs 3767 in water; 4325 and Moses 4872 burnt 6999-55 the whole ram 352 upon the altar: 4196 it [was] a burnt sacrifice 5930 for a sweet 5207 savour, 7381 [and] an offering made by fire 801 unto the LORD; 3068 as the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses. 4872

8:22 And he brought 7126-55 the other 8145 ram, 352 the ram 352 of consecration: 4394 and Aaron 175 and his sons 1121 laid 5564-4 their hands 3027 upon the head 7218 of the ram. 352

8:23 And he slew 7819-4 [it]; and Moses 4872 took 3947-4 of the blood 1818 of it, and put 5414-4 [it] upon the tip 8571 of Aaron's 175 right 3233 ear, 241 and upon the thumb 931 of his right 3233 hand, 3027 and upon the great toe 931 of his right 3233 foot. 7272

8:24 And he brought 7126-55 Aaron's 175 sons, 1121 and Moses 4872 put 5414-4 of the blood 1818 upon the tip 8571 of their right 3233 ear, 241 and upon the thumbs 931 of their right 3233 hands, 3027 and upon the great toes 931 of their right 3233 feet: 7272 and Moses 4872 sprinkled 2236-4 the blood 1818 upon the altar 4196 round about. 5439

8:25 And he took 3947-4 the fat, 2459 and the rump, 451 and all the fat 2459 that [was] upon the inwards, 7130 and the caul 3508 [above] the liver, 3516 and the two 8147 kidneys, 3629 and their fat, 2459 and the right 3225 shoulder: 7785

8:26 And out of the basket 5536 of unleavened 4682 bread, 3899 that [was] before 6440 the LORD, 3068 he took 3947-1 one 259 unleavened 4682 cake, 2471 and a cake 2471 of oiled 8081 bread, and one 259 wafer, 7550 and put 7760-4 [them] on the fat, 2459 and upon the right 3225 shoulder: 7785

8:27 And he put 5414-4 all upon Aaron's 175 hands, 3709 and upon his sons' 1121 hands, 3709 and waved 5130-55 them [for] a wave offering 8573 before 6440 the LORD. 3068

8:28 And Moses 4872 took 3947-4 them from off their hands, 3709 and burnt 6999-55 [them] on the altar 4196 upon the burnt offering: 5930 they [were] consecrations 4394 for a sweet 5207 savour: 7381 it [is] an offering made by fire 801 unto the LORD. 3068

8:29 And Moses 4872 took 3947-4 the breast, 2373 and waved 5130-55 it [for] a wave offering 8573 before 6440 the LORD: 3068 [for] of the ram 352 of consecration 4394 it was Moses' 4872 part; 4490 as the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses. 4872

8:30 And Moses 4872 took 3947-4 of the anointing 4888 oil, 8081 and of the blood 1818 which [was] upon the altar, 4196 and sprinkled 5137-55 [it] upon Aaron, 175 [and] upon his garments, 899 and upon his sons, 1121 and upon his sons' 1121 garments 899 with him; and sanctified 6942-17 Aaron, 175 [and] his garments, 899 and his sons, 1121 and his sons' 1121 garments 899 with him.

8:31 And Moses 4872 said 559-4 unto Aaron 175 and to his sons, 1121 Boil 1310-16 the flesh 1320 [at] the door 6607 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation: 4150 and there eat 398-4 it with the bread 3899 that [is] in the basket 5536 of consecrations, 4394 as I commanded, 6680-14 saying, 559-2 Aaron 175 and his sons 1121 shall eat 398-4 it.

8:32 And that which remaineth 3498-12 of the flesh 1320 and of the bread 3899 shall ye burn 8313-4 with fire. 784

8:33 And ye shall not go out 3318-4 of the door 6607 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation 4150 [in] seven 7651 days, 3117 until the days 3117 of your consecration 4394 be at an end: 4390-2 3117 for seven 7651 days 3117 shall he consecrate 4390-17 3027 you.

8:34 As he hath done 6213-1 this day, 3117 [so] the LORD 3068 hath commanded 6680-14 to do, 6213-2 to make an atonement 3722-15 for you.

8:35 Therefore shall ye abide 3427-4 [at] the door 6607 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation 4150 day 3119 and night 3915 seven 7651 days, 3117 and keep 8104-1 the charge 4931 of the LORD, 3068 that ye die 4191-4 not: for so I am commanded. 6680-27

8:36 So Aaron 175 and his sons 1121 did 6213-4 all things 1697 which the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 by the hand 3027 of Moses. 4872

9:1 And it came to pass on the eighth 8066 day, 3117 [that] Moses 4872 called 7121-1 Aaron 175 and his sons, 1121 and the elders 2205 of Israel; 3478

9:2 And he said 559-4 unto Aaron, 175 Take 3947-3 thee a young calf 5695 1121 1241 for a sin offering, 2403 and a ram 352 for a burnt offering, 5930 without blemish, 8549 and offer 7126-54 [them] before 6440 the LORD. 3068

9:3 And unto the children 1121 of Israel 3478 thou shalt speak, 1696-17 saying, 559-2 Take 3947-3 ye a kid 8163 of the goats 5795 for a sin offering; 2403 and a calf 5695 and a lamb, 3532 [both] of the first 1121 year, 8141 without blemish, 8549 for a burnt offering; 5930

9:4 Also a bullock 7794 and a ram 352 for peace offerings, 8002 to sacrifice 2076-2 before 6440 the LORD; 3068 and a meat offering 4503 mingled 1101-7 with oil: 8081 for to day 3117 the LORD 3068 will appear 7200-8 unto you.

9:5 And they brought 3947-4 [that] which Moses 4872 commanded 6680-14 before 6440 the tabernacle 168 of the congregation: 4150 and all the congregation 5712 drew near 7126-4 and stood 5975-4 before 6440 the LORD. 3068

9:6 And Moses 4872 said, 559-4 This [is] the thing 1697 which the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 that ye should do: 6213-4 and the glory 3519 of the LORD 3068 shall appear 7200-11 unto you.

9:7 And Moses 4872 said 559-4 unto Aaron, 175 Go 7126-3 unto the altar, 4196 and offer 6213-3 thy sin offering, 2403 and thy burnt offering, 5930 and make an atonement 3722-16 for thyself, and for the people: 5971 and offer 6213-3 the offering 7133 of the people, 5971 and make an atonement 3722-16 for them; as the LORD 3068 commanded. 6680-14

9:8 Aaron 175 therefore went 7126-4 unto the altar, 4196 and slew 7819-4 the calf 5695 of the sin offering, 2403 which [was] for himself.

9:9 And the sons 1121 of Aaron 175 brought 7126-55 the blood 1818 unto him: and he dipped 2881-4 his finger 676 in the blood, 1818 and put 5414-4 [it] upon the horns 7161 of the altar, 4196 and poured 3332-1 out the blood 1818 at the bottom 3247 of the altar: 4196

9:10 But the fat, 2459 and the kidneys, 3629 and the caul 3508 above 4480 the liver 3516 of the sin offering, 2403 he burnt 6999-52 upon the altar; 4196 as the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses. 4872

9:11 And the flesh 1320 and the hide 5785 he burnt 8313-1 with fire 784 without 2351 the camp. 4264

9:12 And he slew 7819-4 the burnt offering; 5930 and Aaron's 175 sons 1121 presented 4672-55 unto him the blood, 1818 which he sprinkled 2236-4 round about 5439 upon the altar. 4196

9:13 And they presented 4672-52 the burnt offering 5930 unto him, with the pieces 5409 thereof, and the head: 7218 and he burnt 6999-55 [them] upon the altar. 4196

9:14 And he did wash 7364-4 the inwards 7130 and the legs, 3767 and burnt 6999-55 [them] upon the burnt offering 5930 on the altar. 4196

9:15 And he brought 7126-55 the people's 5971 offering, 7133 and took 3947-4 the goat, 8163 which [was] the sin offering 2403 for the people, 5971 and slew 7819-4 it, and offered it for sin, 2398-17 as the first. 7223

9:16 And he brought 7126-55 the burnt offering, 5930 and offered 6213-4 it according to the manner. 4941

9:17 And he brought 7126-55 the meat offering, 4503 and took an handful 4390-17 3709 thereof, and burnt 6999-55 [it] upon the altar, 4196 beside 905 the burnt sacrifice 5930 of the morning. 1242

9:18 He slew 7819-4 also the bullock 7794 and the ram 352 [for] a sacrifice 2077 of peace offerings, 8002 which [was] for the people: 5971 and Aaron's 175 sons 1121 presented 4672-55 unto him the blood, 1818 which he sprinkled 2236-4 upon the altar 4196 round about, 5439

9:19 And the fat 2459 of the bullock 7794 and of the ram, 352 the rump, 451 and that which covereth 4374 [the inwards], and the kidneys, 3629 and the caul 3508 [above] the liver: 3516

9:20 And they put 7760-4 the fat 2459 upon the breasts, 2373 and he burnt 6999-55 the fat 2459 upon the altar: 4196

9:21 And the breasts 2373 and the right 3225 shoulder 7785 Aaron 175 waved 5130-52 [for] a wave offering 8573 before 6440 the LORD; 3068 as Moses 4872 commanded. 6680-14

9:22 And Aaron 175 lifted up 5375-4 his hand 3027 toward the people, 5971 and blessed 1288-17 them, and came down 3381-4 from offering 6213-2 of the sin offering, 2403 and the burnt offering, 5930 and peace offerings. 8002

9:23 And Moses 4872 and Aaron 175 went 935-4 into the tabernacle 168 of the congregation, 4150 and came out, 3318-4 and blessed 1288-17 the people: 5971 and the glory 3519 of the LORD 3068 appeared 7200-11 unto all the people. 5971

9:24 And there came a fire 784 out 3318-4 from before 6440 the LORD, 3068 and consumed 398-4 upon the altar 4196 the burnt offering 5930 and the fat: 2459 [which] when all the people 5971 saw, 7200-4 they shouted, 7442-4 and fell 5307-4 on their faces. 6440

10:1 And Nadab 5070 and Abihu, 30 the sons 1121 of Aaron, 175 took 3947-4 either of them 376 his censer, 4289 and put 5414-4 fire 784 therein, 2004 and put 7760-4 incense 7004 thereon, and offered 7126-55 strange 2114-5 fire 784 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 which he commanded 6680-14 them not.

10:2 And there went out 3318-4 fire 784 from 6440 the LORD, 3068 and devoured 398-4 them, and they died 4191-4 before 6440 the LORD. 3068

10:3 Then Moses 4872 said 559-4 unto Aaron, 175 This [is it] that the LORD 3068 spake, 1696-14 saying, 559-2 I will be sanctified 6942-11 in them that come nigh 7138 me, and before 6440 all the people 5971 I will be glorified. 3513-11 And Aaron 175 held his peace. 1826-4

10:4 And Moses 4872 called 7121-4 Mishael 4332 and Elzaphan, 469 the sons 1121 of Uzziel 5816 the uncle 1730 of Aaron, 175 and said 559-4 unto them, Come near, 7126-3 carry 5375-3 your brethren 251 from before 6440 the sanctuary 6944 out 2351 of the camp. 4264

10:5 So they went near, 7126-4 and carried 5375-4 them in their coats 3801 out 2351 of the camp; 4264 as Moses 4872 had said. 1696-14

10:6 And Moses 4872 said 559-4 unto Aaron, 175 and unto Eleazar 499 and unto Ithamar, 385 his sons, 1121 Uncover 6544-4 not your heads, 7218 neither rend 6533-4 your clothes; 899 lest ye die, 4191-4 and lest wrath 7107-4 come upon all the people: 5712 but let your brethren, 251 the whole house 1004 of Israel, 3478 bewail 1058-4 the burning 8316 which the LORD 3068 hath kindled. 8313-1

10:7 And ye shall not go out 3318-4 from the door 6607 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation, 4150 lest ye die: 4191-4 for the anointing 4888 oil 8081 of the LORD 3068 [is] upon you. And they did 6213-4 according to the word 1697 of Moses. 4872

10:8 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Aaron, 175 saying, 559-2

10:9 Do not drink 8354-4 wine 3196 nor strong drink, 7941 thou, nor thy sons 1121 with thee, when ye go 935-2 into the tabernacle 168 of the congregation, 4150 lest ye die: 4191-4 [it shall be] a statute 2708 for ever 5769 throughout your generations: 1755

10:10 And that ye may put difference 914-53 between holy 6944 and unholy, 2455 and between unclean 2931 and clean; 2889

10:11 And that ye may teach 3384-53 the children 1121 of Israel 3478 all the statutes 2706 which the LORD 3068 hath spoken 1696-14 unto them by the hand 3027 of Moses. 4872

10:12 And Moses 4872 spake 1696-17 unto Aaron, 175 and unto Eleazar 499 and unto Ithamar, 385 his sons 1121 that were left, 3498-12 Take 3947-3 the meat offering 4503 that remaineth 3498-12 of the offerings of the LORD 3068 made by fire, 801 and eat 398-3 it without leaven 4682 beside 681 the altar: 4196 for it [is] most 6944 holy: 6944

10:13 And ye shall eat 398-1 it in the holy 6918 place, 4725 because it [is] thy due, 2706 and thy sons' 1121 due, 2706 of the sacrifices of the LORD 3068 made by fire: 801 for so I am commanded. 6680-27

10:14 And the wave 8573 breast 2373 and heave 8641 shoulder 7785 shall ye eat 398-4 in a clean 2889 place; 4725 thou, and thy sons, 1121 and thy daughters 1323 with thee: for [they be] thy due, 2706 and thy sons' 1121 due, 2706 [which] are given 5414-8 out of the sacrifices 2077 of peace offerings 8002 of the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

10:15 The heave 8641 shoulder 7785 and the wave 8573 breast 2373 shall they bring 935-55 with the offerings made by fire 801 of the fat, 2459 to wave 5130-53 [it for] a wave offering 8573 before 6440 the LORD; 3068 and it shall be thine, and thy sons' 1121 with thee, by a statute 2706 for ever; 5769 as the LORD 3068 hath commanded. 6680-14

10:16 And Moses 4872 diligently 1875-2 sought 1875-1 the goat 8163 of the sin offering, 2403 and, behold, it was burnt: 8313-27 and he was angry 7107-4 with Eleazar 499 and Ithamar, 385 the sons 1121 of Aaron 175 [which were] left 3498-12 [alive], saying, 559-2

10:17 Wherefore have ye not eaten 398-1 the sin offering 2403 in the holy 6944 place, 4725 seeing it [is] most 6944 holy, 6944 and [God] hath given 5414-1 it you to bear 5375-2 the iniquity 5771 of the congregation, 5712 to make atonement 3722-15 for them before 6440 the LORD? 3068

10:18 Behold, 2005 the blood 1818 of it was not brought 935-90 in within 6441 the holy 6944 [place]: ye should indeed 398-2 have eaten 398-4 it in the holy 6944 [place], as I commanded. 6680-14

10:19 And Aaron 175 said 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 Behold, this day 3117 have they offered 7126-52 their sin offering 2403 and their burnt offering 5930 before 6440 the LORD; 3068 and such things have befallen 7122-4 me: and [if] I had eaten 398-1 the sin offering 2403 to day, 3117 should it have been accepted 3190-4 in the sight 5869 of the LORD? 3068

10:20 And when Moses 4872 heard 8085-4 [that], he was content. 3190-4 5869

11:1 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses 4872 and to Aaron, 175 saying 559-2 unto them,

11:2 Speak 1696-16 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 saying, 559-2 These 2063 [are] the beasts 2416 which ye shall eat 398-4 among all the beasts 929 that [are] on the earth. 776

11:3 Whatsoever parteth 6536-56 the hoof, 6541 and is clovenfooted, 8156-6 8157 6541 [and] cheweth 5927-56 the cud, 1625 among the beasts, 929 that shall ye eat. 398-4

11:4 Nevertheless 389 these shall ye not eat 398-4 of them that chew 5927-56 the cud, 1625 or of them that divide 6536-56 the hoof: 6541 [as] the camel, 1581 because he cheweth 5927-56 the cud, 1625 but divideth 6536-56 not the hoof; 6541 he [is] unclean 2931 unto you.

11:5 And the coney, 8227 because he cheweth 5927-56 the cud, 1625 but divideth 6536-55 not the hoof; 6541 he [is] unclean 2931 unto you.

11:6 And the hare, 768 because he cheweth 5927-56 the cud, 1625 but divideth 6536-52 not the hoof; 6541 he [is] unclean 2931 unto you.

11:7 And the swine, 2386 though he divide 6536-56 the hoof, 6541 and be clovenfooted, 8156-6 8157 6541 yet he cheweth 1641-11 not the cud; 1625 he [is] unclean 2931 to you.

11:8 Of their flesh 1320 shall ye not eat, 398-4 and their carcase 5038 shall ye not touch; 5060-4 they [are] unclean 2931 to you.

11:9 These shall ye eat 398-4 of all that [are] in the waters: 4325 whatsoever hath fins 5579 and scales 7193 in the waters, 4325 in the seas, 3220 and in the rivers, 5158 them shall ye eat. 398-4

11:10 And all that have not fins 5579 and scales 7193 in the seas, 3220 and in the rivers, 5158 of all that move 8318 in the waters, 4325 and of any living 2416 thing 5315 which [is] in the waters, 4325 they [shall be] an abomination 8263 unto you:

11:11 They shall be even an abomination 8263 unto you; ye shall not eat 398-4 of their flesh, 1320 but ye shall have their carcases 5038 in abomination. 8262-17

11:12 Whatsoever hath no fins 5579 nor scales 7193 in the waters, 4325 that [shall be] an abomination 8263 unto you.

11:13 And these [are they which] ye shall have in abomination 8262-17 among 4480 the fowls; 5775 they shall not be eaten, 398-11 they [are] an abomination: 8263 the eagle, 5404 and the ossifrage, 6538 and the ospray, 5822

11:14 And the vulture, 1676 and the kite 344 after his kind; 4327

11:15 Every raven 6158 after his kind; 4327

11:16 And the owl, 1323 3284 and the night hawk, 8464 and the cuckow, 7828 and the hawk 5322 after his kind, 4327

11:17 And the little owl, 3563 and the cormorant, 7994 and the great owl, 3244

11:18 And the swan, 8580 and the pelican, 6893 and the gier eagle, 7360

11:19 And the stork, 2624 the heron 601 after her kind, 4327 and the lapwing, 1744 and the bat. 5847

11:20 All fowls 5775 that creep, 8318 going 1980-6 upon [all] four, 702 [shall be] an abomination 8263 unto you.

11:21 Yet these may ye eat 398-4 of every flying 5775 creeping thing 8318 that goeth 1980-6 upon [all] four, 702 which have legs 3767 above 4605 their feet, 7272 to leap 5425-15 withal 2004 upon the earth; 776

11:22 [Even] these of them ye may eat; 398-4 the locust 697 after his kind, 4327 and the bald locust 5556 after his kind, 4327 and the beetle 2728 after his kind, 4327 and the grasshopper 2284 after his kind. 4327

11:23 But all [other] flying 5775 creeping things, 8318 which have four 702 feet, 7272 [shall be] an abomination 8263 unto you.

11:24 And for these ye shall be unclean: 2930-101 whosoever toucheth 5060-6 the carcase 5038 of them shall be unclean 2930-4 until the even. 6153

11:25 And whosoever beareth 5375-6 [ought] of the carcase 5038 of them shall wash 3526-17 his clothes, 899 and be unclean 2930-1 until the even. 6153

11:26 [The carcases] of every beast 929 which divideth 6536-56 the hoof, 6541 and [is] not clovenfooted, 8157 8156-6 nor cheweth 5927-56 the cud, 1625 [are] unclean 2931 unto you: every one that toucheth 5060-6 them shall be unclean. 2930-4

11:27 And whatsoever goeth 1980-6 upon his paws, 3709 among all manner of beasts 2416 that go 1980-6 on [all] four, 702 those 1992 [are] unclean 2931 unto you: whoso 3605 toucheth 5060-6 their carcase 5038 shall be unclean 2930-4 until the even. 6153

11:28 And he that beareth 5375-6 the carcase 5038 of them shall wash 3526-17 his clothes, 899 and be unclean 2930-1 until the even: 6153 they [are] unclean 2931 unto you.

11:29 These also [shall be] unclean 2931 unto you among the creeping things 8318 that creep 8317-6 upon the earth; 776 the weasel, 2467 and the mouse, 5909 and the tortoise 6632 after his kind, 4327

11:30 And the ferret, 604 and the chameleon, 3581 and the lizard, 3911 and the snail, 2546 and the mole. 8580

11:31 These [are] unclean 2931 to you among all that creep: 8318 whosoever doth touch 5060-6 them, when they be dead, 4194 shall be unclean 2930-4 until the even. 6153

11:32 And upon whatsoever [any] of them, when they are dead, 4194 doth fall, 5307-4 it shall be unclean; 2930-4 whether [it be] any vessel 3627 of wood, 6086 or raiment, 899 or skin, 5785 or sack, 8242 whatsoever vessel 3627 [it be], wherein [any] work 4399 is done, 6213-11 it must be put 935-93 into water, 4325 and it shall be unclean 2930-1 until the even; 6153 so it shall be cleansed. 2891-1

11:33 And every earthen 2789 vessel, 3627 whereinto 8432 [any] of them falleth, 5307-4 whatsoever [is] in it 8432 shall be unclean; 2930-4 and ye shall break 7665-4 it.

11:34 Of all meat 400 which may be eaten, 398-11 [that] on which [such] water 4325 cometh 935-4 shall be unclean: 2930-4 and all drink 4945 that may be drunk 8354-11 in every [such] vessel 3627 shall be unclean. 2930-4

11:35 And every [thing] whereupon [any part] of their carcase 5038 falleth 5307-4 shall be unclean; 2930-4 [whether it be] oven, 8574 or ranges 3600 for pots, they shall be broken down: 5422-93 [for] they [are] unclean, 2931 and shall be unclean 2931 unto you.

11:36 Nevertheless a fountain 4599 or pit, 953 [wherein there is] plenty 4723 of water, 4325 shall be clean: 2889 but that which toucheth 5060-6 their carcase 5038 shall be unclean. 2930-4

11:37 And if [any part] of their carcase 5038 fall 5307-4 upon any sowing 2221 seed 2233 which is to be sown, 2232-11 it [shall be] clean. 2889

11:38 But if [any] water 4325 be put 5414-93 upon the seed, 2233 and [any part] of their carcase 5038 fall 5307-1 thereon, it [shall be] unclean 2931 unto you.

11:39 And if any beast, 929 of which ye may eat, 402 die; 4191-4 he that toucheth 5060-6 the carcase 5038 thereof shall be unclean 2930-4 until the even. 6153

11:40 And he that eateth 398-6 of the carcase 5038 of it shall wash 3526-17 his clothes, 899 and be unclean 2930-1 until the even: 6153 he also that beareth 5375-6 the carcase 5038 of it shall wash 3526-17 his clothes, 899 and be unclean 2930-1 until the even. 6153

11:41 And every creeping thing 8318 that creepeth 8317-6 upon the earth 776 [shall be] an abomination; 8263 it shall not be eaten. 398-11

11:42 Whatsoever goeth 1980-6 upon the belly, 1512 and whatsoever goeth 1980-6 upon [all] four, 702 or whatsoever hath more 7235-56 feet 7272 among all creeping things 8318 that creep 8317-6 upon the earth, 776 them ye shall not eat; 398-4 for they [are] an abomination. 8263

11:43 Ye shall not make yourselves 5315 abominable 8262-17 with any creeping thing 8318 that creepeth, 8317-6 neither shall ye make yourselves unclean 2930-101 with them, that ye should be defiled 2933-8 thereby.

11:44 For I [am] the LORD 3068 your God: 430 ye shall therefore sanctify 6942-98 yourselves, and ye shall be holy; 6918 for I [am] holy: 6918 neither shall ye defile 2930-17 yourselves 5315 with any manner of creeping thing 8318 that creepeth 7430-6 upon the earth. 776

11:45 For I [am] the LORD 3068 that bringeth you up 5927-56 out of the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 to be your God: 430 ye shall therefore be holy, 6918 for I [am] holy. 6918

11:46 This [is] the law 8451 of the beasts, 929 and of the fowl, 5775 and of every living 2416 creature 5315 that moveth 7430-6 in the waters, 4325 and of every creature 5315 that creepeth 8317-6 upon the earth: 776

11:47 To make a difference 914-53 between the unclean 2931 and the clean, 2889 and between the beast 2416 that may be eaten 398-12 and the beast 2416 that may not be eaten. 398-11

12:1 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

12:2 Speak 1696-16 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 saying, 559-2 If a woman 802 have conceived seed, 2232-55 and born 3205-1 a man child: 2145 then she shall be unclean 2930-1 seven 7651 days; 3117 according to the days 3117 of the separation 5079 for her infirmity 1738-2 shall she be unclean. 2930-4

12:3 And in the eighth 8066 day 3117 the flesh 1320 of his foreskin 6190 shall be circumcised. 4135-11

12:4 And she shall then continue 3427-4 in the blood 1818 of her purifying 2893 three 7969 3117 and thirty 7970 days; 3117 she shall touch 5060-4 no hallowed thing, 6944 nor come 935-4 into the sanctuary, 4720 until the days 3117 of her purifying 2892 be fulfilled. 4390-2

12:5 But if she bear 3205-4 a maid child, 5347 then she shall be unclean 2930-1 two weeks, 7620 as in her separation: 5079 and she shall continue 3427-4 in the blood 1818 of her purifying 2893 threescore 8346 3117 and six 8337 days. 3117

12:6 And when the days 3117 of her purifying 2892 are fulfilled, 4390-2 for a son, 1121 or for a daughter, 1323 she shall bring 935-55 a lamb 3532 of the first 1121 year 8141 for a burnt offering, 5930 and a young 1121 pigeon, 3123 or a turtledove, 8449 for a sin offering, 2403 unto the door 6607 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation, 4150 unto the priest: 3548

12:7 Who shall offer 7126-52 it before 6440 the LORD, 3068 and make an atonement 3722-14 for her; and she shall be cleansed 2891-1 from the issue 4726 of her blood. 1818 This [is] the law 8451 for her that hath born 3205-6 a male 2145 or a female. 5347

12:8 And if she be not able 3027 1767 to bring 4672-4 a lamb, 7716 then she shall bring 3947-1 two 8147 turtles, 8449 or two 8147 young 1121 pigeons; 3123 the one 259 for the burnt offering, 5930 and the other 259 for a sin offering: 2403 and the priest 3548 shall make an atonement 3722-14 for her, and she shall be clean. 2891-1

13:1 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses 4872 and Aaron, 175 saying, 559-2

13:2 When a man 120 shall have in the skin 5785 of his flesh 1320 a rising, 7613 a scab, 5597 or bright spot, 934 and it be in the skin 5785 of his flesh 1320 [like] the plague 5061 of leprosy; 6883 then he shall be brought 935-90 unto Aaron 175 the priest, 3548 or unto one 259 of his sons 1121 the priests: 3548

13:3 And the priest 3548 shall look 7200-1 on the plague 5061 in the skin 5785 of the flesh: 1320 and [when] the hair 8181 in the plague 5061 is turned 2015-1 white, 3836 and the plague 5061 in sight 4758 [be] deeper 6013 than the skin 5785 of his flesh, 1320 it [is] a plague 5061 of leprosy: 6883 and the priest 3548 shall look 7200-1 on him, and pronounce him unclean. 2930-14

13:4 If the bright spot 934 [be] white 3836 in the skin 5785 of his flesh, 1320 and in sight 4758 [be] not deeper 6013 than the skin, 5785 and the hair 8181 thereof be not turned 2015-1 white; 3836 then the priest 3548 shall shut up 5462-52 [him that hath] the plague 5061 seven 7651 days: 3117

13:5 And the priest 3548 shall look 7200-1 on him the seventh 7637 day: 3117 and, behold, [if] the plague 5061 in his sight 5869 be at a stay, 5975-1 [and] the plague 5061 spread 6581-1 not in the skin; 5785 then the priest 3548 shall shut him up 5462-52 seven 7651 days 3117 more: 8145

13:6 And the priest 3548 shall look 7200-1 on him again 8145 the seventh 7637 day: 3117 and, behold, [if] the plague 5061 [be] somewhat dark, 3544 [and] the plague 5061 spread 6581-1 not in the skin, 5785 the priest 3548 shall pronounce him clean: 2891-14 it [is but] a scab: 4556 and he shall wash 3526-14 his clothes, 899 and be clean. 2891-1

13:7 But if the scab 4556 spread 6581-4 much abroad 6581-2 in the skin, 5785 after 310 that he hath been seen 7200-9 of the priest 3548 for his cleansing, 2893 he shall be seen 7200-8 of the priest 3548 again: 8145

13:8 And [if] the priest 3548 see 7200-1 that, behold, the scab 4556 spreadeth 6581-1 in the skin, 5785 then the priest 3548 shall pronounce him unclean: 2930-14 it [is] a leprosy. 6883

13:9 When the plague 5061 of leprosy 6883 is in a man, 120 then he shall be brought 935-90 unto the priest; 3548

13:10 And the priest 3548 shall see 7200-1 [him]: and, behold, [if] the rising 7613 [be] white 3836 in the skin, 5785 and it have turned 2015-1 the hair 8181 white, 3836 and [there be] quick 4241 raw 2416 flesh 1320 in the rising; 7613

13:11 It [is] an old 3462-12 leprosy 6883 in the skin 5785 of his flesh, 1320 and the priest 3548 shall pronounce him unclean, 2930-14 and shall not shut him up: 5462-55 for he [is] unclean. 2931

13:12 And if a leprosy 6883 break out 6524-4 abroad 6524-2 in the skin, 5785 and the leprosy 6883 cover 3680-14 all the skin 5785 of [him that hath] the plague 5061 from his head 7218 even to his foot, 7272 wheresoever the priest 3548 looketh; 4758 5869

13:13 Then the priest 3548 shall consider: 7200-1 and, behold, [if] the leprosy 6883 have covered 3680-14 all his flesh, 1320 he shall pronounce [him] clean 2891-14 [that hath] the plague: 5061 it is all turned 2015-1 white: 3836 he [is] clean. 2889

13:14 But when 3117 raw 2416 flesh 1320 appeareth 7200-9 in him, he shall be unclean. 2930-4

13:15 And the priest 3548 shall see 7200-1 the raw 2416 flesh, 1320 and pronounce him to be unclean: 2930-14 [for] the raw 2416 flesh 1320 [is] unclean: 2931 it [is] a leprosy. 6883

13:16 Or if the raw 2416 flesh 1320 turn again, 7725-4 and be changed 2015-8 unto white, 3836 he shall come 935-1 unto the priest; 3548

13:17 And the priest 3548 shall see 7200-1 him: and, behold, [if] the plague 5061 be turned 2015-8 into white; 3836 then the priest 3548 shall pronounce [him] clean 2891-14 [that hath] the plague: 5061 he [is] clean. 2889

13:18 The flesh 1320 also, 3588 in which, [even] in the skin 5785 thereof, was a boil, 7822 and is healed, 7495-8

13:19 And in the place 4725 of the boil 7822 there be a white 3836 rising, 7613 or a bright spot, 934 white, 3836 and somewhat reddish, 125 and it be shewed 7200-8 to the priest; 3548

13:20 And if, when the priest 3548 seeth 7200-1 it, behold, it [be] in sight 4758 lower 8217 than the skin, 5785 and the hair 8181 thereof be turned 2015-1 white; 3836 the priest 3548 shall pronounce him unclean: 2930-14 it [is] a plague 5061 of leprosy 6883 broken out 6524-1 of the boil. 7822

13:21 But if the priest 3548 look 7200-4 on it, and, behold, [there be] no white 3836 hairs 8181 therein, and [if] it [be] not lower 8217 than the skin, 5785 but [be] somewhat dark; 3544 then the priest 3548 shall shut him up 5462-52 seven 7651 days: 3117

13:22 And if it spread 6581-4 much abroad 6581-2 in the skin, 5785 then the priest 3548 shall pronounce him unclean: 2930-14 it [is] a plague. 5061

13:23 But if the bright spot 934 stay 5975-4 in his place, [and] spread 6581-1 not, it [is] a burning 6867 boil; 7822 and the priest 3548 shall pronounce him clean. 2891-14

13:24 Or if there be [any] flesh, 1320 in the skin 5785 whereof [there is] a hot 784 burning, 4348 and the quick 4241 [flesh] that burneth 4348 have a white 3836 bright spot, 934 somewhat reddish, 125 or white; 3836

13:25 Then the priest 3548 shall look 7200-1 upon it: and, behold, [if] the hair 8181 in the bright spot 934 be turned 2015-8 white, 3836 and it [be in] sight 4758 deeper 6013 than the skin; 5785 it [is] a leprosy 6883 broken out 6524-1 of the burning: 4348 wherefore the priest 3548 shall pronounce him unclean: 2930-14 it [is] the plague 5061 of leprosy. 6883

13:26 But if the priest 3548 look 7200-4 on it, and, behold, [there be] no white 3836 hair 8181 in the bright spot, 934 and it [be] no lower 8217 than the [other] skin, 5785 but [be] somewhat dark; 3544 then the priest 3548 shall shut him up 5462-52 seven 7651 days: 3117

13:27 And the priest 3548 shall look 7200-1 upon him the seventh 7637 day: 3117 [and] if it be spread 6581-4 much abroad 6581-2 in the skin, 5785 then the priest 3548 shall pronounce him unclean: 2930-14 it [is] the plague 5061 of leprosy. 6883

13:28 And if the bright spot 934 stay 5975-4 in his place, [and] spread 6581-1 not in the skin, 5785 but it [be] somewhat dark; 3544 it [is] a rising 7613 of the burning, 4348 and the priest 3548 shall pronounce him clean: 2891-14 for it [is] an inflammation 6867 of the burning. 4348

13:29 If a man 376 or woman 802 have a plague 5061 upon the head 7218 or the beard; 2206

13:30 Then the priest 3548 shall see 7200-1 the plague: 5061 and, behold, if it [be] in sight 4758 deeper 6013 than the skin; 5785 [and there be] in it a yellow 6669 thin 1851 hair; 8181 then the priest 3548 shall pronounce him unclean: 2930-14 it [is] a dry scall, 5424 [even] a leprosy 6883 upon the head 7218 or beard. 2206

13:31 And if the priest 3548 look 7200-4 on the plague 5061 of the scall, 5424 and, behold, it [be] not in sight 4758 deeper 6013 than the skin, 5785 and [that there is] no black 7838 hair 8181 in it; then the priest 3548 shall shut up 5462-52 [him that hath] the plague 5061 of the scall 5424 seven 7651 days: 3117

13:32 And in the seventh 7637 day 3117 the priest 3548 shall look 7200-1 on the plague: 5061 and, behold, [if] the scall 5424 spread 6581-1 not, and there be in it no yellow 6669 hair, 8181 and the scall 5424 [be] not in sight 4758 deeper 6013 than the skin; 5785

13:33 He shall be shaven, 1548-98 but the scall 5424 shall he not shave; 1548-17 and the priest 3548 shall shut up 5462-52 [him that hath] the scall 5424 seven 7651 days 3117 more: 8145

13:34 And in the seventh 7637 day 3117 the priest 3548 shall look 7200-1 on the scall: 5424 and, behold, [if] the scall 5424 be not spread 6581-1 in the skin, 5785 nor [be] in sight 4758 deeper 6013 than the skin; 5785 then the priest 3548 shall pronounce him clean: 2891-14 and he shall wash 3526-14 his clothes, 899 and be clean. 2891-1

13:35 But if the scall 5424 spread 6581-4 much 6581-2 in the skin 5785 after 310 his cleansing; 2893

13:36 Then the priest 3548 shall look 7200-1 on him: and, behold, if the scall 5424 be spread 6581-1 in the skin, 5785 the priest 3548 shall not seek 1239-17 for yellow 6669 hair; 8181 he [is] unclean. 2931

13:37 But if the scall 5424 be in his sight 5869 at a stay, 5975-1 and [that] there is black 7838 hair 8181 grown up 6779-1 therein; the scall 5424 is healed, 7495-8 he [is] clean: 2889 and the priest 3548 shall pronounce him clean. 2891-14

13:38 If a man 376 also or a woman 802 have in the skin 5785 of their flesh 1320 bright spots, 934 [even] white 3836 bright spots; 934

13:39 Then the priest 3548 shall look: 7200-1 and, behold, [if] the bright spots 934 in the skin 5785 of their flesh 1320 [be] darkish 3544 white; 3836 it [is] a freckled spot 933 [that] groweth 6524-1 in the skin; 5785 he [is] clean. 2889

13:40 And the man 376 3588 whose hair is fallen off 4803-11 his head, 7218 he [is] bald; 7142 [yet is] he clean. 2889

13:41 And he that hath his hair fallen off 4803-11 from the part 6285 of his head 7218 toward his face, 6440 he [is] forehead bald: 1371 [yet is] he clean. 2889

13:42 And if there be in the bald head, 7146 or bald forehead, 1372 a white 3836 reddish 125 sore; 5061 it [is] a leprosy 6883 sprung up 6524-6 in his bald head, 7146 or his bald forehead. 1372

13:43 Then the priest 3548 shall look 7200-1 upon it: and, behold, [if] the rising 7613 of the sore 5061 [be] white 3836 reddish 125 in his bald head, 7146 or in his bald forehead, 1372 as the leprosy 6883 appeareth 4758 in the skin 5785 of the flesh; 1320

13:44 He is a leprous 6879-7 man, 376 he [is] unclean: 2931 the priest 3548 shall pronounce him utterly 2930-15 unclean; 2930-17 his plague 5061 [is] in his head. 7218

13:45 And the leper 6879-7 in whom the plague 5061 [is], his clothes 899 shall be rent, 6533-7 and his head 7218 bare, 6544-7 and he shall put a covering 5844-4 upon his upper lip, 8222 and shall cry, 7121-4 Unclean, 2931 unclean. 2931

13:46 All the days 3117 wherein the plague 5061 [shall be] in him he shall be defiled; 2930-4 he [is] unclean: 2931 he shall dwell 3427-4 alone; 910 without 2351 the camp 4264 [shall] his habitation 4186 [be].

13:47 The garment 899 also that the plague 5061 of leprosy 6883 is in, [whether it be] a woollen 6785 garment, 899 or a linen 6593 garment; 899

13:48 Whether [it be] in the warp, 8359 or woof; 6154 of linen, 6593 or of woollen; 6785 whether in a skin, 5785 or in any thing made 4399 of skin; 5785

13:49 And if the plague 5061 be greenish 3422 or reddish 125 in the garment, 899 or in the skin, 5785 either 176 in the warp, 8359 or in the woof, 6154 or in any thing 3627 of skin; 5785 it [is] a plague 5061 of leprosy, 6883 and shall be shewed 7200-90 unto the priest: 3548

13:50 And the priest 3548 shall look 7200-1 upon the plague, 5061 and shut up 5462-52 [it that hath] the plague 5061 seven 7651 days: 3117

13:51 And he shall look 7200-1 on the plague 5061 on the seventh 7637 day: 3117 if the plague 5061 be spread 6581-1 in the garment, 899 either in the warp, 8359 or in the woof, 6154 or in a skin, 5785 [or] in any work 4399 that is made 6213-11 of skin; 5785 the plague 5061 [is] a fretting 3992-56 leprosy; 6883 it [is] unclean. 2931

13:52 He shall therefore burn 8313-1 that garment, 899 whether warp 8359 or woof, 6154 in woollen 6785 or in linen, 6593 or any thing 3627 of skin, 5785 wherein the plague 5061 is: for it [is] a fretting 3992-56 leprosy; 6883 it shall be burnt 8313-11 in the fire. 784

13:53 And if the priest 3548 shall look, 7200-4 and, behold, the plague 5061 be not spread 6581-1 in the garment, 899 either 176 in the warp, 8359 or 176 in the woof, 6154 or 176 in any thing 3627 of skin; 5785

13:54 Then the priest 3548 shall command 6680-14 that they wash 3526-14 [the thing] wherein the plague 5061 [is], and he shall shut it up 5462-52 seven 7651 days 3117 more: 8145

13:55 And the priest 3548 shall look 7200-1 on the plague, 5061 after 310 that it is washed: 3526-121 and, behold, [if] the plague 5061 have not changed 2015-1 his colour, 5869 and the plague 5061 be not spread; 6581-1 it [is] unclean; 2931 thou shalt burn 8313-4 it in the fire; 784 it [is] fret 6356 inward, [whether] it [be] bare within 7146 or without. 1372

13:56 And if the priest 3548 look, 7200-1 and, behold, the plague 5061 [be] somewhat dark 3544 after 310 the washing 3526-121 of it; then he shall rend 7167-1 it out of the garment, 899 or out of the skin, 5785 or out of the warp, 8359 or out of the woof: 6154

13:57 And if it appear 7200-11 still 5750 in the garment, 899 either in the warp, 8359 or in the woof, 6154 or in any thing 3627 of skin; 5785 it [is] a spreading 6524-6 [plague]: thou shalt burn 8313-4 that wherein the plague 5061 [is] with fire. 784

13:58 And the garment, 899 either warp, 8359 or woof, 6154 or whatsoever thing 3627 of skin 5785 [it be], which thou shalt wash, 3526-17 if the plague 5061 be departed 5493-1 from them, then it shall be washed 3526-27 the second time, 8145 and shall be clean. 2891-1

13:59 This [is] the law 8451 of the plague 5061 of leprosy 6883 in a garment 899 of woollen 6785 or linen, 6593 either in the warp, 8359 or woof, 6154 or any thing 3627 of skins, 5785 to pronounce it clean, 2891-15 or to pronounce it unclean. 2930-15

14:1 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

14:2 This shall be the law 8451 of the leper 6879-30 in the day 3117 of his cleansing: 2893 He shall be brought 935-90 unto the priest: 3548

14:3 And the priest 3548 shall go forth 3318-1 out 2351 of the camp; 4264 and the priest 3548 shall look, 7200-1 and, behold, [if] the plague 5061 of leprosy 6883 be healed 7495-8 in the leper; 6879-7

14:4 Then shall the priest 3548 command 6680-14 to take 3947-1 for him that is to be cleansed 2891-102 two 8147 birds 6833 alive 2416 [and] clean, 2889 and cedar 730 wood, 6086 and scarlet, 8144 8438 and hyssop: 231

14:5 And the priest 3548 shall command 6680-14 that one 259 of the birds 6833 be killed 7819-1 in an earthen 2789 vessel 3627 over running 2416 water: 4325

14:6 As for the living 2416 bird, 6833 he shall take 3947-4 it, and the cedar 730 wood, 6086 and the scarlet, 8144 8438 and the hyssop, 231 and shall dip 2881-1 them and the living 2416 bird 6833 in the blood 1818 of the bird 6833 [that was] killed 7819-7 over the running 2416 water: 4325

14:7 And he shall sprinkle 5137-52 upon him that is to be cleansed 2891-102 from the leprosy 6883 seven 7651 times, 6471 and shall pronounce him clean, 2891-14 and shall let the living 2416 bird 6833 loose 7971-14 into the open 6440 field. 7704

14:8 And he that is to be cleansed 2891-102 shall wash 3526-14 his clothes, 899 and shave 1548-14 off all his hair, 8181 and wash 7364-1 himself in water, 4325 that he may be clean: 2891-1 and after 310 that he shall come 935-4 into the camp, 4264 and shall tarry 3427-1 abroad out 2351 of his tent 168 seven 7651 days. 3117

14:9 But it shall be on the seventh 7637 day, 3117 that he shall shave 1548-17 all his hair 8181 off his head 7218 and his beard 2206 and his eyebrows, 1354 5869 even all his hair 8181 he shall shave 1548-17 off: and he shall wash 3526-14 his clothes, 899 also he shall wash 7364-1 his flesh 1320 in water, 4325 and he shall be clean. 2891-1

14:10 And on the eighth 8066 day 3117 he shall take 3947-4 two 8147 he lambs 3532 without blemish, 8549 and one 259 ewe lamb 3535 of the first 1323 year 8141 without blemish, 8549 and three 7969 tenth deals 6241 of fine flour 5560 [for] a meat offering, 4503 mingled 1101-7 with oil, 8081 and one 259 log 3849 of oil. 8081

14:11 And the priest 3548 that maketh [him] clean 2891-18 shall present 5975-52 the man 376 that is to be made clean, 2891-102 and those things, before 6440 the LORD, 3068 [at] the door 6607 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation: 4150

14:12 And the priest 3548 shall take 3947-1 one 259 he lamb, 3532 and offer 7126-52 him for a trespass offering, 817 and the log 3849 of oil, 8081 and wave 5130-52 them [for] a wave offering 8573 before 6440 the LORD: 3068

14:13 And he shall slay 7819-1 the lamb 3532 in the place 4725 where he shall kill 7819-4 the sin offering 2403 and the burnt offering, 5930 in the holy 6944 place: 4725 for as the sin offering 2403 [is] the priest's, 3548 [so is] the trespass offering: 817 it [is] most 6944 holy: 6944

14:14 And the priest 3548 shall take 3947-1 [some] of the blood 1818 of the trespass offering, 817 and the priest 3548 shall put 5414-1 [it] upon the tip 8571 of the right 3233 ear 241 of him that is to be cleansed, 2891-102 and upon the thumb 931 of his right 3233 hand, 3027 and upon the great toe 931 of his right 3233 foot: 7272

14:15 And the priest 3548 shall take 3947-1 [some] of the log 3849 of oil, 8081 and pour 3332-1 [it] into the palm 3709 of his own 3548 left 8042 hand:

14:16 And the priest 3548 shall dip 2881-1 his right 3233 finger 676 in the oil 8081 that [is] in his left 8042 hand, 3709 and shall sprinkle 5137-52 of the oil 8081 with his finger 676 seven 7651 times 6471 before 6440 the LORD: 3068

14:17 And of the rest 3499 of the oil 8081 that [is] in his hand 3709 shall the priest 3548 put 5414-4 upon the tip 8571 of the right 3233 ear 241 of him that is to be cleansed, 2891-102 and upon the thumb 931 of his right 3233 hand, 3027 and upon the great toe 931 of his right 3233 foot, 7272 upon the blood 1818 of the trespass offering: 817

14:18 And the remnant 3498-12 of the oil 8081 that [is] in the priest's 3548 hand 3709 he shall pour 5414-4 upon the head 7218 of him that is to be cleansed: 2891-102 and the priest 3548 shall make an atonement 3722-14 for him before 6440 the LORD. 3068

14:19 And the priest 3548 shall offer 6213-1 the sin offering, 2403 and make an atonement 3722-14 for him that is to be cleansed 2891-102 from his uncleanness; 2932 and afterward 310 he shall kill 7819-4 the burnt offering: 5930

14:21 And if he [be] poor, 1800 and cannot get 3027 5381-56 so much; then he shall take 3947-1 one 259 lamb 3532 [for] a trespass offering 817 to be waved, 8573 to make an atonement 3722-15 for him, and one 259 tenth deal 6241 of fine flour 5560 mingled 1101-7 with oil 8081 for a meat offering, 4503 and a log 3849 of oil; 8081

14:25 And he shall kill 7819-1 the lamb 3532 of the trespass offering, 817 and the priest 3548 shall take 3947-1 [some] of the blood 1818 of the trespass offering, 817 and put 5414-1 [it] upon the tip 8571 of the right 3233 ear 241 of him that is to be cleansed, 2891-102 and upon the thumb 931 of his right 3233 hand, 3027 and upon the great toe 931 of his right 3233 foot: 7272

14:26 And the priest 3548 shall pour 3332-4 of the oil 8081 into the palm 3709 of his own 3548 left 8042 hand:

14:27 And the priest 3548 shall sprinkle 5137-52 with his right 3233 finger 676 [some] of the oil 8081 that [is] in his left 8042 hand 3709 seven 7651 times 6471 before 6440 the LORD: 3068

14:28 And the priest 3548 shall put 5414-1 of the oil 8081 that [is] in his hand 3709 upon the tip 8571 of the right 3233 ear 241 of him that is to be cleansed, 2891-102 and upon the thumb 931 of his right 3233 hand, 3027 and upon the great toe 931 of his right 3233 foot, 7272 upon the place 4725 of the blood 1818 of the trespass offering: 817

14:32 This [is] the law 8451 [of him] in whom [is] the plague 5061 of leprosy, 6883 whose hand 3027 is not able to get 5381-55 [that which pertaineth] to his cleansing. 2893

14:33 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses 4872 and unto Aaron, 175 saying, 559-2

14:34 When ye be come 935-4 into the land 776 of Canaan, 3667 which I give 5414-6 to you for a possession, 272 and I put 5414-1 the plague 5061 of leprosy 6883 in a house 1004 of the land 776 of your possession; 272

14:35 And he that owneth the house 1004 shall come 935-1 and tell 5046-52 the priest, 3548 saying, 559-2 It seemeth 7200-8 to me [there is] as it were a plague 5061 in the house: 1004

14:36 Then the priest 3548 shall command 6680-14 that they empty 6437-14 the house, 1004 before the priest 3548 go 935-4 [into it] to see 7200-2 the plague, 5061 that all that [is] in the house 1004 be not made unclean: 2930-4 and afterward 310 the priest 3548 shall go in 935-4 to see 7200-2 the house: 1004

14:37 And he shall look 7200-1 on the plague, 5061 and, behold, [if] the plague 5061 [be] in the walls 7023 of the house 1004 with hollow strakes, 8258 greenish 3422 or reddish, 125 which in sight 4758 [are] lower 8217 than 4480 the wall; 7023

14:38 Then the priest 3548 shall go out 3318-1 of the house 1004 to the door 6607 of the house, 1004 and shut up 5462-52 the house 1004 seven 7651 days: 3117

14:39 And the priest 3548 shall come again 7725-1 the seventh 7637 day, 3117 and shall look: 7200-1 and, behold, [if] the plague 5061 be spread 6581-1 in the walls 7023 of the house; 1004

14:40 Then the priest 3548 shall command 6680-14 that they take away 2502-14 the stones 68 in 2004 which the plague 5061 [is], and they shall cast 7993-52 them 853 into an unclean 2931 place 4725 without 2351 the city: 5892

14:41 And he shall cause the house 1004 to be scraped 7106-55 within 1004 round about, 5439 and they shall pour out 8210-1 the dust 6083 that they scrape 7096-52 off without 2351 the city 5892 into an unclean 2931 place: 4725

14:42 And they shall take 3947-1 other 312 stones, 68 and put 935-52 [them] in the place 8478 of those stones; 68 and he shall take 3947-4 other 312 morter, 6083 and shall plaister 2902-1 the house. 1004

14:43 And if the plague 5061 come again, 7725-4 and break out 6524-1 in the house, 1004 after 310 that he hath taken away 2502-14 the stones, 68 and after 310 he hath scraped 7096-53 the house, 1004 and after 310 it is plaistered; 2902-9

14:44 Then the priest 3548 shall come 935-1 and look, 7200-1 and, behold, [if] the plague 5061 be spread 6581-1 in the house, 1004 it [is] a fretting 3992-56 leprosy 6883 in the house: 1004 it [is] unclean. 2931

14:45 And he shall break down 5422-1 the house, 1004 the stones 68 of it, and the timber 6086 thereof, and all the morter 6083 of the house; 1004 and he shall carry [them] forth 3318-52 out 2351 of the city 5892 into an unclean 2931 place. 4725

14:46 Moreover he that goeth 935-6 into the house 1004 all the while 3117 that it is shut up 5462-52 shall be unclean 2930-4 until the even. 6153

14:47 And he that lieth 7901-6 in the house 1004 shall wash 3526-17 his clothes; 899 and he that eateth 398-6 in the house 1004 shall wash 3526-17 his clothes. 899

14:48 And if the priest 3548 shall come in, 935-4 935-2 and look 7200-1 [upon it], and, behold, the plague 5061 hath not spread 6581-1 in the house, 1004 after 310 the house 1004 was plaistered: 2902-9 then the priest 3548 shall pronounce the house 1004 clean, 2891-14 because the plague 5061 is healed. 7495-8

14:49 And he shall take 3947-1 to cleanse 2398-15 the house 1004 two 8147 birds, 6833 and cedar 730 wood, 6086 and scarlet, 8144 8438 and hyssop: 231

14:50 And he shall kill 7819-1 the one 259 of the birds 6833 in an earthen 2789 vessel 3627 over running 2416 water: 4325

14:51 And he shall take 3947-1 the cedar 730 wood, 6086 and the hyssop, 231 and the scarlet, 8144 8438 and the living 2416 bird, 6833 and dip 2881-1 them in the blood 1818 of the slain 7819-7 bird, 6833 and in the running 2416 water, 4325 and sprinkle 5137-52 the house 1004 seven 7651 times: 6471

14:52 And he shall cleanse 2398-14 the house 1004 with the blood 1818 of the bird, 6833 and with the running 2416 water, 4325 and with the living 2416 bird, 6833 and with the cedar 730 wood, 6086 and with the hyssop, 231 and with the scarlet: 8144 8438

14:53 But he shall let go 7971-14 the living 2416 bird 6833 out 2351 of the city 5892 into the open 6440 fields, 7704 and make an atonement 3722-14 for the house: 1004 and it shall be clean. 2891-1

14:54 This [is] the law 8451 for all manner of plague 5061 of leprosy, 6883 and scall, 5424

14:55 And for the leprosy 6883 of a garment, 899 and of a house, 1004

14:56 And for a rising, 7613 and for a scab, 5597 and for a bright spot: 934

14:57 To teach 3384-53 when 3117 [it is] unclean, 2931 and when 3117 [it is] clean: 2889 this [is] the law 8451 of leprosy. 6883

15:1 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses 4872 and to Aaron, 175 saying, 559-2

15:2 Speak 1696-16 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and say 559-1 unto them, When any 376 man 376 hath a running issue 2100-6 out of his flesh, 1320 [because of] his issue 2101 he [is] unclean. 2931

15:3 And this shall be his uncleanness 2932 in his issue: 2101 whether his flesh 1320 run 7325-1 with his issue, 2101 or his flesh 1320 be stopped 2856-52 from his issue, 2101 it [is] his uncleanness. 2932

15:4 Every bed, 4904 whereon he lieth 7901-4 that hath the issue, 2100-6 is unclean: 2930-4 and every thing, 3627 whereon he sitteth, 3427-4 shall be unclean. 2930-4

15:5 And whosoever 376 toucheth 5060-4 his bed 4904 shall wash 3526-17 his clothes, 899 and bathe 7364-1 [himself] in water, 4325 and be unclean 2930-1 until the even. 6153

15:6 And he that sitteth 3427-6 on [any] thing 3627 whereon he sat 3427-4 that hath the issue 2100-6 shall wash 3526-17 his clothes, 899 and bathe 7364-1 [himself] in water, 4325 and be unclean 2930-1 until the even. 6153

15:7 And he that toucheth 5060-6 the flesh 1320 of him that hath the issue 2100-6 shall wash 3526-17 his clothes, 899 and bathe 7364-1 [himself] in water, 4325 and be unclean 2930-1 until the even. 6153

15:8 And if he that hath the issue 2100-6 spit 7556-4 upon him that is clean; 2889 then he shall wash 3526-14 his clothes, 899 and bathe 7364-1 [himself] in water, 4325 and be unclean 2930-1 until the even. 6153

15:9 And what saddle 4817 soever he rideth 7392-4 upon that hath the issue 2100-6 shall be unclean. 2930-4

15:10 And whosoever toucheth 5060-6 any thing that was under him shall be unclean 2930-4 until the even: 6153 and he that beareth 5375-6 [any of] those things shall wash 3526-17 his clothes, 899 and bathe 7364-1 [himself] in water, 4325 and be unclean 2930-1 until the even. 6153

15:11 And whomsoever he toucheth 5060-4 that hath the issue, 2100-6 and hath not rinsed 7857-1 his hands 3027 in water, 4325 he shall wash 3526-14 his clothes, 899 and bathe 7364-1 [himself] in water, 4325 and be unclean 2930-1 until the even. 6153

15:12 And the vessel 3627 of earth, 2789 that he toucheth 5060-4 which hath the issue, 2100-6 shall be broken: 7665-11 and every vessel 3627 of wood 6086 shall be rinsed 7857-11 in water. 4325

15:13 And when he that hath an issue 2100-6 is cleansed 2891-4 of his issue; 2101 then he shall number 5608-1 to himself seven 7651 days 3117 for his cleansing, 2893 and wash 3526-14 his clothes, 899 and bathe 7364-1 his flesh 1320 in running 2416 water, 4325 and shall be clean. 2891-1

15:14 And on the eighth 8066 day 3117 he shall take 3947-4 to him two 8147 turtledoves, 8449 or two 8147 young 1121 pigeons, 3123 and come 935-1 before 6440 the LORD 3068 unto the door 6607 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation, 4150 and give 5414-1 them unto the priest: 3548

15:15 And the priest 3548 shall offer 6213-1 them, the one 259 [for] a sin offering, 2403 and the other 259 [for] a burnt offering; 5930 and the priest 3548 shall make an atonement 3722-14 for him before 6440 the LORD 3068 for his issue. 2101

15:16 And if any man's 376 seed 2233 of copulation 7902 go out 3318-4 from him, then he shall wash 7364-1 all his flesh 1320 in water, 4325 and be unclean 2930-1 until the even. 6153

15:17 And every garment, 899 and every skin, 5785 whereon is the seed 2233 of copulation, 7902 shall be washed 3526-27 with water, 4325 and be unclean 2930-1 until the even. 6153

15:18 The woman 802 also with whom man 376 shall lie 7901-4 [with] seed 2233 of copulation, 7902 they shall [both] bathe 7364-1 [themselves] in water, 4325 and be unclean 2930-1 until the even. 6153

15:19 And if a woman 802 have an issue, 2100-6 [and] her issue 2101 in her flesh 1320 be blood, 1818 she shall be put apart 5079 seven 7651 days: 3117 and whosoever toucheth 5060-6 her shall be unclean 2930-4 until the even. 6153

15:20 And every thing that she lieth 7901-4 upon in her separation 5079 shall be unclean: 2930-4 every thing also that she sitteth 3427-4 upon shall be unclean. 2930-4

15:21 And whosoever toucheth 5060-6 her bed 4904 shall wash 3526-17 his clothes, 899 and bathe 7364-1 [himself] in water, 4325 and be unclean 2930-1 until the even. 6153

15:22 And whosoever toucheth 5060-6 any thing 3627 that she sat 3427-4 upon shall wash 3526-17 his clothes, 899 and bathe 7364-1 [himself] in water, 4325 and be unclean 2930-1 until the even. 6153

15:23 And if it [be] on [her] bed, 4904 or on any thing 3627 whereon she sitteth, 3427-6 when he toucheth 5060-2 it, he shall be unclean 2930-4 until the even. 6153

15:24 And if any man 376 lie 7901-4 with her at all, 7901-2 and her flowers 5079 be upon him, he shall be unclean 2930-1 seven 7651 days; 3117 and all the bed 4904 whereon he lieth 7901-4 shall be unclean. 2930-4

15:25 And if a woman 802 have 2100-4 an issue 2101 of her blood 1818 many 7227 days 3117 out 3808 of the time 6256 of her separation, 5079 or if it run 2100-4 beyond the time 5921 of her separation; 5079 all the days 3117 of the issue 2101 of her uncleanness 2932 shall be as the days 3117 of her separation: 5079 she [shall be] unclean. 2931

15:26 Every bed 4904 whereon she lieth 7901-4 all the days 3117 of her issue 2101 shall be unto her as the bed 4904 of her separation: 5079 and whatsoever 3627 she sitteth 3427-4 upon shall be unclean, 2931 as the uncleanness 2932 of her separation. 5079

15:27 And whosoever toucheth 5060-6 those things shall be unclean, 2930-4 and shall wash 3526-14 his clothes, 899 and bathe 7364-1 [himself] in water, 4325 and be unclean 2930-1 until the even. 6153

15:28 But if she be cleansed 2891-1 of her issue, 2101 then she shall number 5608-1 to herself seven 7651 days, 3117 and after 310 that she shall be clean. 2891-4

15:29 And on the eighth 8066 day 3117 she shall take 3947-4 unto her two 8147 turtles, 8449 or two 8147 young 1121 pigeons, 3123 and bring 935-52 them unto the priest, 3548 to the door 6607 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation. 4150

15:30 And the priest 3548 shall offer 6213-1 the one 259 [for] a sin offering, 2403 and the other 259 [for] a burnt offering; 5930 and the priest 3548 shall make an atonement 3722-14 for her before 6440 the LORD 3068 for the issue 2101 of her uncleanness. 2932

15:31 Thus shall ye separate 5144-52 the children 1121 of Israel 3478 from their uncleanness; 2932 that they die 4191-4 not in their uncleanness, 2932 when they defile 2930-15 my tabernacle 4908 that [is] among 8432 them.

15:32 This [is] the law 8451 of him that hath an issue, 2100-6 and [of him] whose seed 2233 7902 goeth 3318-4 from him, and is defiled 2930-2 therewith;

15:33 And of her that is sick 1739 of her flowers, 5079 and of him that hath 2100-6 an issue, 2101 of the man, 2145 and of the woman, 5347 and of him 376 that lieth 7901-4 with her that is unclean. 2931

16:1 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses 4872 after 310 the death 4194 of the two 8147 sons 1121 of Aaron, 175 when they offered 7126-2 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 and died; 4191-4

16:2 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Speak 1696-16 unto Aaron 175 thy brother, 251 that he come 935-4 not at all times 6256 into the holy 6944 [place] within 1004 the vail 6532 before 6440 the mercy seat, 3727 which [is] upon the ark; 727 that he die 4191-4 not: for I will appear 7200-11 in the cloud 6051 upon the mercy seat. 3727

16:3 Thus 2063 shall Aaron 175 come 935-4 into the holy 6944 [place]: with a young 6499 1121 bullock 1241 for a sin offering, 2403 and a ram 352 for a burnt offering. 5930

16:4 He shall put on 3847-4 the holy 6944 linen 906 coat, 3801 and he shall have the linen 906 breeches 4370 upon his flesh, 1320 and shall be girded 2296-4 with a linen 906 girdle, 73 and with the linen 906 mitre 4701 shall he be attired: 6801-4 these 1992 [are] holy 6944 garments; 899 therefore shall he wash 7364-1 his flesh 1320 in water, 4325 and [so] put them on. 3847-1

16:5 And he shall take 3947-4 of the congregation 5712 of the children 1121 of Israel 3478 two 8147 kids 8163 of the goats 5795 for a sin offering, 2403 and one 259 ram 352 for a burnt offering. 5930

16:6 And Aaron 175 shall offer 7126-52 his bullock 6499 of the sin offering, 2403 which [is] for himself, 834 and make an atonement 3722-14 for himself, 1157 and for his house. 1004

16:7 And he shall take 3947-1 the two 8147 goats, 8163 and present 5975-52 them before 6440 the LORD 3068 [at] the door 6607 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation. 4150

16:8 And Aaron 175 shall cast 5414-1 lots 1486 upon the two 8147 goats; 8163 one 259 lot 1486 for the LORD, 3068 and the other 259 lot 1486 for the scapegoat. 5799

16:9 And Aaron 175 shall bring 7126-52 the goat 8163 upon which the LORD'S 3068 lot 1486 fell, 5927-1 and offer 6213-1 him [for] a sin offering. 2403

16:10 But the goat, 8163 on which the lot 1486 fell 5927-1 to be the scapegoat, 5799 shall be presented 5975-93 alive 2416 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 to make an atonement 3722-15 with him, [and] to let him go 7971-15 for a scapegoat 5799 into the wilderness. 4057

16:11 And Aaron 175 shall bring 7126-52 the bullock 6499 of the sin offering, 2403 which [is] for himself, and shall make an atonement 3722-14 for himself, and for his house, 1004 and shall kill 7819-1 the bullock 6499 of the sin offering 2403 which [is] for himself:

16:12 And he shall take 3947-1 a censer 4289 full 4393 of burning coals 1513 of fire 784 from off the altar 4196 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 and his hands 2651 full 4393 of sweet 5561 incense 7004 beaten small, 1851 and bring 935-52 [it] within 1004 the vail: 6532

16:13 And he shall put 5414-1 the incense 7004 upon the fire 784 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 that the cloud 6051 of the incense 7004 may cover 3680-14 the mercy seat 3727 that [is] upon the testimony, 5715 that he die 4191-4 not:

16:14 And he shall take 3947-1 of the blood 1818 of the bullock, 6499 and sprinkle 5137-52 [it] with his finger 676 upon 6440 the mercy seat 3727 eastward; 6924 and before 6440 the mercy seat 3727 shall he sprinkle 5137-55 of the blood 1818 with his finger 676 seven 7651 times. 6471

16:15 Then shall he kill 7819-1 the goat 8163 of the sin offering, 2403 that [is] for the people, 5971 and bring 935-52 his blood 1818 within 1004 the vail, 6532 and do 6213-1 with that blood 1818 as he did 6213-1 with the blood 1818 of the bullock, 6499 and sprinkle 5137-52 it upon the mercy seat, 3727 and before 6440 the mercy seat: 3727

16:16 And he shall make an atonement 3722-14 for the holy 6944 [place], because of the uncleanness 2932 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and because of their transgressions 6588 in all their sins: 2403 and so shall he do 6213-4 for the tabernacle 168 of the congregation, 4150 that remaineth 7931-6 among them in the midst 8432 of their uncleanness. 2932

16:17 And there shall be no man 120 in the tabernacle 168 of the congregation 4150 when he goeth 935-2 in to make an atonement 3722-15 in the holy 6944 [place], until he come out, 3318-2 and have made an atonement 3722-14 for himself, and for his household, 1004 and for all the congregation 6951 of Israel. 3478

16:18 And he shall go out 3318-1 unto the altar 4196 that [is] before 6440 the LORD, 3068 and make an atonement 3722-14 for it; and shall take 3947-1 of the blood 1818 of the bullock, 6499 and of the blood 1818 of the goat, 8163 and put 5414-1 [it] upon the horns 7161 of the altar 4196 round about. 5439

16:19 And he shall sprinkle 5137-52 of the blood 1818 upon it with his finger 676 seven 7651 times, 6471 and cleanse 2891-14 it, and hallow 6942-14 it from the uncleanness 2932 of the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

16:20 And when he hath made an end 3615-14 of reconciling 3722-15 the holy 6944 [place], and the tabernacle 168 of the congregation, 4150 and the altar, 4196 he shall bring 7126-52 the live 2416 goat: 8163

16:21 And Aaron 175 shall lay 5564-1 both 8147 his hands 3027 upon the head 7218 of the live 2416 goat, 8163 and confess 3034-98 over him all the iniquities 5771 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and all their transgressions 6588 in all their sins, 2403 putting 5414-1 them upon the head 7218 of the goat, 8163 and shall send [him] away 7971-14 by the hand 3027 of a fit 6261 man 376 into the wilderness: 4057

16:22 And the goat 8163 shall bear 5375-1 upon him all their iniquities 5771 unto a land 776 not inhabited: 1509 and he shall let go 7971-14 the goat 8163 in the wilderness. 4057

16:23 And Aaron 175 shall come 935-1 into the tabernacle 168 of the congregation, 4150 and shall put off 6584-1 the linen 906 garments, 899 which he put on 3847-1 when he went 935-2 into the holy 6944 [place], and shall leave 3240-52 them there:

16:24 And he shall wash 7364-1 his flesh 1320 with water 4325 in the holy 6918 place, 4725 and put on 3847-1 his garments, 899 and come forth, 3318-1 and offer 6213-1 his burnt offering, 5930 and the burnt offering 5930 of the people, 5971 and make an atonement 3722-14 for himself, and for the people. 5971

16:25 And the fat 2459 of the sin offering 2403 shall he burn 6999-55 upon the altar. 4196

16:26 And he that let go 7971-18 the goat 8163 for the scapegoat 5799 shall wash 3526-17 his clothes, 899 and bathe 7364-1 his flesh 1320 in water, 4325 and afterward 310 come 935-4 into the camp. 4264

16:27 And the bullock 6499 [for] the sin offering, 2403 and the goat 8163 [for] the sin offering, 2403 whose blood 1818 was brought in 935-90 to make atonement 3722-15 in the holy 6944 [place], shall [one] carry forth 3318-55 without 2351 the camp; 4264 and they shall burn 8313-1 in the fire 784 their skins, 5785 and their flesh, 1320 and their dung. 6569

16:28 And he that burneth 8313-6 them shall wash 3526-17 his clothes, 899 and bathe 7364-1 his flesh 1320 in water, 4325 and afterward 310 he shall come 935-4 into the camp. 4264

16:29 And [this] shall be a statute 2708 for ever 5769 unto you: [that] in the seventh 7637 month, 2320 on the tenth 6218 [day] of the month, 2320 ye shall afflict 6031-17 your souls, 5315 and do 6213-4 no work 4399 at all, [whether it be] one of your own country, 249 or a stranger 1616 that sojourneth 1481-6 among 8432 you:

16:30 For on that day 3117 shall [the priest] make an atonement 3722-17 for you, to cleanse 2891-15 you, [that] ye may be clean 2891-4 from all your sins 2403 before 6440 the LORD. 3068

16:31 It [shall be] a sabbath 7676 of rest 7677 unto you, and ye shall afflict 6031-14 your souls, 5315 by a statute 2708 for ever. 5769

16:32 And the priest, 3548 whom he shall anoint, 4886-4 and whom he shall consecrate 4390-17 3027 to minister in the priest's office 3547-15 in his father's 1 stead, shall make the atonement, 3722-14 and shall put on 3847-1 the linen 906 clothes, 899 [even] the holy 6944 garments: 899

16:33 And he shall make an atonement 3722-14 for the holy 6944 sanctuary, 4720 and he shall make an atonement 3722-17 for the tabernacle 168 of the congregation, 4150 and for the altar, 4196 and he shall make an atonement 3722-17 for the priests, 3548 and for all the people 5971 of the congregation. 6951

16:34 And this shall be an everlasting 5769 statute 2708 unto you, to make an atonement 3722-15 for the children 1121 of Israel 3478 for all their sins 2403 once 259 a year. 8141 And he did 6213-4 as the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses. 4872

17:1 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

17:2 Speak 1696-16 unto Aaron, 175 and unto his sons, 1121 and unto all the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and say 559-1 unto them; This [is] the thing 1697 which the LORD 3068 hath commanded, 6680-14 saying, 559-2

17:3 What man 376 soever 376 [there be] of the house 1004 of Israel, 3478 that killeth 7819-4 an ox, 7794 or lamb, 3775 or goat, 5795 in the camp, 4264 or that killeth 7819-4 [it] out 2351 of the camp, 4264

17:4 And bringeth 935-52 it not unto the door 6607 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation, 4150 to offer 7126-53 an offering 7133 unto the LORD 3068 before 6440 the tabernacle 4908 of the LORD; 3068 blood 1818 shall be imputed 2803-11 unto that man; 376 he hath shed 8210-1 blood; 1818 and that man 376 shall be cut off 3772-8 from among 7130 his people: 5971

17:5 To the end that the children 1121 of Israel 3478 may bring 935-55 their sacrifices, 2077 which they offer 2076-6 in the open 6440 field, 7704 even that they may bring 935-52 them unto the LORD, 3068 unto the door 6607 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation, 4150 unto the priest, 3548 and offer 2076-1 them [for] peace 8002 offerings 2077 unto the LORD. 3068

17:6 And the priest 3548 shall sprinkle 2236-1 the blood 1818 upon the altar 4196 of the LORD 3068 [at] the door 6607 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation, 4150 and burn 6999-52 the fat 2459 for a sweet 5207 savour 7381 unto the LORD. 3068

17:7 And they shall no more offer 2076-4 their sacrifices 2077 unto devils, 8163 after 310 whom they have gone a whoring. 2181-6 This shall be a statute 2708 for ever 5769 unto them throughout their generations. 1755

17:8 And thou shalt say 559-4 unto them, Whatsoever 376 man 376 [there be] of the house 1004 of Israel, 3478 or of the strangers 1616 which sojourn 1481-4 among 8432 you, that offereth 5927-55 a burnt offering 5930 or sacrifice, 2077

17:9 And bringeth 935-55 it not unto the door 6607 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation, 4150 to offer 6213-2 it unto the LORD; 3068 even that man 376 shall be cut off 3772-8 from among his people. 5971

17:10 And whatsoever man 376 [there be] of the house 1004 of Israel, 3478 or of the strangers 1616 that sojourn 1481-6 among 8432 you, that eateth 398-4 any manner of blood; 1818 I will even set 5414-1 my face 6440 against that soul 5315 that eateth 398-6 blood, 1818 and will cut him off 3772-52 from among 7130 his people. 5971

17:11 For the life 5315 of the flesh 1320 [is] in the blood: 1818 and I have given 5414-1 it to you upon the altar 4196 to make an atonement 3722-15 for your souls: 5315 for it [is] the blood 1818 [that] maketh an atonement 3722-17 for the soul. 5315

17:12 Therefore I said 559-1 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 No soul 5315 of you shall eat 398-4 blood, 1818 neither shall any stranger 1616 that sojourneth 1481-6 among 8432 you eat 398-4 blood. 1818

17:13 And whatsoever man 376 [there be] of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 or of the strangers 1616 that sojourn 1481-6 among 8432 you, which hunteth 6679-4 and catcheth 6718 any beast 2416 or fowl 5775 that may be eaten; 398-11 he shall even pour out 8210-1 the blood 1818 thereof, and cover 3680-14 it with dust. 6083

17:14 For [it is] the life 5315 of all flesh; 1320 the blood 1818 of it [is] for the life 5315 thereof: therefore I said 559-4 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 Ye shall eat 398-4 the blood 1818 of no manner of flesh: 1320 for the life 5315 of all flesh 1320 [is] the blood 1818 thereof: whosoever eateth 398-6 it shall be cut off. 3772-11

17:15 And every soul 5315 that eateth 398-4 that which died 5038 [of itself], or that which was torn 2966 [with beasts, whether it be] one of your own country, 249 or a stranger, 1616 he shall both wash 3526-14 his clothes, 899 and bathe 7364-1 [himself] in water, 4325 and be unclean 2930-1 until the even: 6153 then shall he be clean. 2891-1

17:16 But if he wash 3526-17 [them] not, nor bathe 7364-4 his flesh; 1320 then he shall bear 5375-1 his iniquity. 5771

18:1 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

18:2 Speak 1696-16 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and say 559-1 unto them, I am the LORD 3068 your God. 430

18:3 After the doings 4639 of the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 wherein ye dwelt, 3427-1 shall ye not do: 6213-4 and after the doings 4639 of the land 776 of Canaan, 3667 whither I bring 935-56 you, shall ye not do: 6213-4 neither shall ye walk 3212-4 in their ordinances. 2708

18:4 Ye shall do 6213-4 my judgments, 4941 and keep 8104-4 mine ordinances, 2708 to walk 3212-2 therein: I [am] the LORD 3068 your God. 430

18:5 Ye shall therefore keep 8104-1 my statutes, 2708 and my judgments: 4941 which 834 if a man 120 do, 6213-4 he shall live 2425-1 in them: I [am] the LORD. 3068

18:6 None of you 376 376 shall approach 7126-4 to any that is near 7607 of kin 1320 to him, to uncover 1540-15 [their] nakedness: 6172 I [am] the LORD. 3068

18:7 The nakedness 6172 of thy father, 1 or the nakedness 6172 of thy mother, 517 shalt thou not uncover: 1540-17 she [is] thy mother; 517 thou shalt not uncover 1540-17 her nakedness. 6172

18:8 The nakedness 6172 of thy father's 1 wife 802 shalt thou not uncover: 1540-17 it [is] thy father's 1 nakedness. 6172

18:9 The nakedness 6172 of thy sister, 269 the daughter 1323 of thy father, 1 or daughter 1323 of thy mother, 517 [whether she be] born 4138 at home, 1004 or born 4138 abroad, 2351 [even] their nakedness 6172 thou shalt not uncover. 1540-17

18:10 The nakedness 6172 of thy son's 1121 daughter, 1323 or of thy daughter's 1323 daughter, 1323 [even] their nakedness 6172 thou shalt not uncover: 1540-17 for theirs 2007 [is] thine own nakedness. 6172

18:11 The nakedness 6172 of thy father's 1 wife's 802 daughter, 1323 begotten 4138 of thy father, 1 she [is] thy sister, 269 thou shalt not uncover 1540-17 her nakedness. 6172

18:12 Thou shalt not uncover 1540-17 the nakedness 6172 of thy father's 1 sister: 269 she [is] thy father's 1 near kinswoman. 7607

18:13 Thou shalt not uncover 1540-17 the nakedness 6172 of thy mother's 517 sister: 269 for she [is] thy mother's 517 near kinswoman. 7607

18:14 Thou shalt not uncover 1540-17 the nakedness 6172 of thy father's 1 brother, 251 thou shalt not approach 7126-4 to his wife: 802 she [is] thine aunt. 1733

18:15 Thou shalt not uncover 1540-17 the nakedness 6172 of thy daughter in law: 3618 she [is] thy son's 1121 wife; 802 thou shalt not uncover 1540-17 her nakedness. 6172

18:16 Thou shalt not uncover 1540-17 the nakedness 6172 of thy brother's 251 wife: 802 it [is] thy brother's 251 nakedness. 6172

18:17 Thou shalt not uncover 1540-17 the nakedness 6172 of a woman 802 and her daughter, 1323 neither shalt thou take 3947-4 her son's 1121 daughter, 1323 or her daughter's 1323 daughter, 1323 to uncover 1540-15 her nakedness; 6172 [for] they [are] her near kinswomen: 7608 it [is] wickedness. 2154

18:18 Neither shalt thou take 3947-4 a wife 802 to her sister, 269 to vex 6887-2 [her], to uncover 1540-15 her nakedness, 6172 beside the other in her life 2416 [time].

18:19 Also thou shalt not approach 7126-4 unto a woman 802 to uncover 1540-15 her nakedness, 6172 as long as she is put apart 5079 for her uncleanness. 2932

18:20 Moreover thou shalt not 5414-4 lie 7903 carnally 2233 with thy neighbour's 5997 wife, 802 to defile 2930-2 thyself with her.

18:21 And thou shalt not let 5414-4 any of thy seed 2233 pass through 5674-53 [the fire] to Molech, 4432 neither shalt thou profane 2490-17 the name 8034 of thy God: 430 I [am] the LORD. 3068

18:22 Thou shalt not lie 7901-4 with mankind, 2145 as with 4904 womankind: 802 it [is] abomination. 8441

18:23 Neither shalt thou 5414-4 lie 7903 with any beast 929 to defile 2930-2 thyself therewith: neither shall any woman 802 stand 5975-4 before 6440 a beast 929 to lie down 7250-2 thereto: it [is] confusion. 8397

18:24 Defile 2930-101 not ye yourselves in any of these 428 things: for in all these the nations 1471 are defiled 2930-8 which I cast out 7971-18 before 6440 you:

18:25 And the land 776 is defiled: 2930-4 therefore I do visit 6485-4 the iniquity 5771 thereof upon it, and the land 776 itself vomiteth 6958-55 out her inhabitants. 3427-6

18:26 Ye shall therefore keep 8104-1 my statutes 2708 and my judgments, 4941 and shall not commit 6213-4 [any] of these abominations; 8441 [neither] any of your own nation, 249 nor any stranger 1616 that sojourneth 1481-6 among 8432 you:

18:27 (For all these 411 abominations 8441 have the men 582 of the land 776 done, 6213-1 which [were] before 6440 you, and the land 776 is defiled;) 2930-4

18:28 That the land 776 spue 6958-55 not you out also, when ye defile 2930-15 it, as it spued 6958-1 out the nations 1471 that [were] before 6440 you.

18:29 For whosoever shall commit 6213-4 any of these abominations, 8441 even the souls 5315 that commit 6213-6 [them] shall be cut off 3772-8 from among 7130 their people. 5971

18:30 Therefore shall ye keep 8104-1 mine ordinance, 4931 that [ye] commit 6213-2 not [any one] of these abominable 8441 customs, 2708 which were committed 6213-8 before 6440 you, and that ye defile 2930-101 not yourselves therein: I [am] the LORD 3068 your God. 430

19:1 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

19:2 Speak 1696-16 unto all the congregation 5712 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and say 559-1 unto them, Ye shall be holy: 6918 for I the LORD 3068 your God 430 [am] holy. 6918

19:3 Ye shall fear 3372-4 every man 376 his mother, 517 and his father, 1 and keep 8104-4 my sabbaths: 7676 I [am] the LORD 3068 your God. 430

19:4 Turn 6437-4 ye not unto idols, 457 nor make 6213-4 to yourselves molten 4541 gods: 430 I [am] the LORD 3068 your God. 430

19:5 And if ye offer 2076-4 a sacrifice 2077 of peace offerings 8002 unto the LORD, 3068 ye shall offer 2076-4 it at your own will. 7522

19:6 It shall be eaten 398-11 the same day 3117 ye offer 2077 it, and on the morrow: 4283 and if ought remain 3498-12 until the third 7992 day, 3117 it shall be burnt 8313-11 in the fire. 784

19:7 And if it be eaten 398-11 at all 398-9 on the third 7992 day, 3117 it [is] abominable; 6292 it shall not be accepted. 7521-11

19:8 Therefore [every one] that eateth 398-6 it shall bear 5375-4 his iniquity, 5771 because he hath profaned 2490-14 the hallowed thing 6944 of the LORD: 3068 and that soul 5315 shall be cut off 3772-8 from among his people. 5971

19:9 And when ye reap 7114-2 the harvest 7105 of your land, 776 thou shalt not wholly reap 3615-17 7114-2 the corners 6285 of thy field, 7704 neither shalt thou gather 3950-17 the gleanings 3951 of thy harvest. 7105

19:10 And thou shalt not glean 5953-25 thy vineyard, 3754 neither shalt thou gather 3950-17 [every] grape 6528 of thy vineyard; 3754 thou shalt leave 5800-4 them for the poor 6041 and stranger: 1616 I [am] the LORD 3068 your God. 430

19:11 Ye shall not steal, 1589-4 neither deal falsely, 3584-17 neither lie 8266-17 one 376 to another. 5997

19:12 And ye shall not swear 7650-11 by my name 8034 falsely, 8267 neither shalt thou profane 2490-14 the name 8034 of thy God: 430 I [am] the LORD. 3068

19:13 Thou shalt not defraud 6231-4 thy neighbour, 7453 neither rob 1497-4 [him]: the wages 6468 of him that is hired 7916 shall not abide 3885-4 with thee all night until the morning. 1242

19:14 Thou shalt not curse 7043-17 the deaf, 2795 nor put 5414-4 a stumblingblock 4383 before 6440 the blind, 5787 but shalt fear 3372-1 thy God: 430 I [am] the LORD. 3068

19:15 Ye shall do 6213-4 no unrighteousness 5766 in judgment: 4941 thou shalt not respect 5375-4 the person 6440 of the poor, 1800 nor honour 1921-4 the person 6440 of the mighty: 1419 [but] in righteousness 6664 shalt thou judge 8199-4 thy neighbour. 5997

19:16 Thou shalt not go 3212-4 up and down [as] a talebearer 7400 among thy people: 5971 neither shalt thou stand 5975-4 against the blood 1818 of thy neighbour: 7453 I [am] the LORD. 3068

19:17 Thou shalt not hate 8130-4 thy brother 251 in thine heart: 3824 thou shalt in any wise 3198-53 rebuke 3198-55 thy neighbour, 5997 and not suffer 5375-4 sin 2399 upon him.

19:18 Thou shalt not avenge, 5358-4 nor bear any grudge 5201-4 against the children 1121 of thy people, 5971 but thou shalt love 157-1 thy neighbour 7453 as thyself: 3644 I [am] the LORD. 3068

19:19 Ye shall keep 8104-4 my statutes. 2708 Thou shalt not let thy cattle 929 gender 7250-55 with a diverse kind: 3610 thou shalt not sow 2232-4 thy field 7704 with mingled seed: 3610 neither 3808 shall a garment 899 mingled 3610 of linen and woollen 8162 come 5927-4 upon thee.

19:20 And whosoever 376 lieth 7901-4 carnally 2233 7902 with a woman, 802 that [is] a bondmaid, 8198 betrothed 2778-12 to an husband, 376 and not at all 6299-91 redeemed, 6299-8 nor freedom 2668 given 5414-8 her; she shall be scourged; 1244 they shall not be put to death, 4191-93 because she was not free. 2666-27

19:21 And he shall bring 935-52 his trespass offering 817 unto the LORD, 3068 unto the door 6607 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation, 4150 [even] a ram 352 for a trespass offering. 817

19:22 And the priest 3548 shall make an atonement 3722-14 for him with the ram 352 of the trespass offering 817 before 6440 the LORD 3068 for his sin 2403 which he hath done: 2398-1 and the sin 2403 which he hath done 2398-1 shall be forgiven 5545-8 him.

19:23 And when ye shall come 935-4 into the land, 776 and shall have planted 5193-1 all manner of trees 6086 for food, 3978 then ye shall count the fruit 6529 thereof as uncircumcised: 6188-1 6190 three 7969 years 8141 shall it be as uncircumcised 6189 unto you: it shall not be eaten 398-11 of.

19:24 But in the fourth 7243 year 8141 all the fruit 6529 thereof shall be holy 6944 to praise 1974 the LORD 3068 [withal].

19:25 And in the fifth 2549 year 8141 shall ye eat 398-4 of the fruit 6529 thereof, that it may yield 3254-53 unto you the increase 8393 thereof: I [am] the LORD 3068 your God. 430

19:26 Ye shall not eat 398-4 [any thing] with the blood: 1818 neither shall ye use enchantment, 5172-17 nor observe times. 6049-25

19:27 Ye shall not round 5362-55 the corners 6285 of your heads, 7218 neither shalt thou mar 7843-55 the corners 6285 of thy beard. 2206

19:28 Ye shall not make 5414-4 any cuttings 8296 in your flesh 1320 for the dead, 5315 nor print 5414-4 any 3793 marks 7085 upon you: I [am] the LORD. 3068

19:29 Do not prostitute 2490-17 thy daughter, 1323 to cause her to be a whore; 2181-53 lest the land 776 fall to whoredom, 2181-4 and the land 776 become full 4390-1 of wickedness. 2154

19:30 Ye shall keep 8104-4 my sabbaths, 7676 and reverence 3372-4 my sanctuary: 4720 I [am] the LORD. 3068

19:31 Regard 6437-4 not them that have familiar spirits, 178 neither seek 1245-17 after wizards, 3049 to be defiled 2930-2 by them: I [am] the LORD 3068 your God. 430

19:32 Thou shalt rise up 6965-4 before 6440 the hoary head, 7872 and honour 1921-1 the face 6440 of the old man, 2205 and fear 3372-1 thy God: 430 I [am] the LORD. 3068

19:33 And if a stranger 1616 sojourn 1481-4 with thee in your land, 776 ye shall not vex 3238-55 him.

19:34 [But] the stranger 1616 that dwelleth 1481-6 with you shall be unto you as one born 249 among you, and thou shalt love 157-1 him as thyself; for ye were strangers 1616 in the land 776 of Egypt: 4714 I [am] the LORD 3068 your God. 430

19:35 Ye shall do 6213-4 no unrighteousness 5766 in judgment, 4941 in meteyard, 4060 in weight, 4948 or in measure. 4884

19:36 Just 6664 balances, 3976 just 6664 weights, 68 a just 6664 ephah, 374 and a just 6664 hin, 1969 shall ye have: I [am] the LORD 3068 your God, 430 which brought you out 3318-52 of the land 776 of Egypt. 4714

19:37 Therefore shall ye observe 8104-1 all my statutes, 2708 and all my judgments, 4941 and do 6213-1 them: I [am] the LORD. 3068

20:1 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

20:2 Again, thou shalt say 559-4 to the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 Whosoever 376 376 [he be] of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 or of the strangers 1616 that sojourn 1481-6 in Israel, 3478 that giveth 5414-4 [any] of his seed 2233 unto Molech; 4432 he shall surely 4191-2 be put to death: 4191-93 the people 5971 of the land 776 shall stone 7275-4 him with stones. 68

20:3 And I will set 5414-4 my face 6440 against that man, 376 and will cut him off 3772-52 from among 7130 his people; 5971 because he hath given 5414-1 of his seed 2233 unto Molech, 4432 to defile 2930-15 my sanctuary, 4720 and to profane 2490-15 my holy 6944 name. 8034

20:4 And if the people 5971 of the land 776 do any ways 5956-53 hide 5956-55 their eyes 5869 from the man, 376 when he giveth 5414-2 of his seed 2233 unto Molech, 4432 and kill 4191-53 him not: 1115

20:5 Then I will set 7760-1 my face 6440 against that man, 376 and against his family, 4940 and will cut him off, 3772-52 and all that go a whoring 2181-6 after 310 him, to commit whoredom 2181-2 with Molech, 4432 from among 7130 their people. 5971

20:6 And the soul 5315 that turneth 6437-4 after 413 such as have familiar spirits, 178 and after wizards, 3049 to go a whoring 2181-2 after 310 them, I will even set 5414-1 my face 6440 against that soul, 5315 and will cut him off 3772-52 from among 7130 his people. 5971

20:7 Sanctify 6942-98 yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: 6918 for I [am] the LORD 3068 your God. 430

20:8 And ye shall keep 8104-1 my statutes, 2708 and do 6213-1 them: I [am] the LORD 3068 which sanctify 6942-18 you.

20:9 For every 376 one 376 that curseth 7043-17 his father 1 or his mother 517 shall be surely 4191-2 put to death: 4191-93 he hath cursed 7043-14 his father 1 or his mother; 517 his blood 1818 [shall be] upon him.

20:10 And the man 376 that committeth adultery 5003-4 with [another] man's 376 wife, 802 [even he] that committeth adultery 5003-4 with his neighbour's 7453 wife, 802 the adulterer 5003-6 and the adulteress 5003-6 shall surely 4191-2 be put to death. 4191-93

20:11 And the man 376 that lieth 7901-4 with his father's 1 wife 802 hath uncovered 1540-14 his father's 1 nakedness: 6172 both 8147 of them shall surely 4191-2 be put to death; 4191-93 their blood 1818 [shall be] upon them.

20:12 And if a man 376 lie 7901-4 with his daughter in law, 3618 both 8147 of them shall surely 4191-2 be put to death: 4191-93 they have wrought 6213-1 confusion; 8397 their blood 1818 [shall be] upon them.

20:13 If a man 376 also lie 7901-4 with mankind, 2145 as he lieth 4904 with a woman, 802 both 8147 of them have committed 6213-1 an abomination: 8441 they shall surely 4191-2 be put to death; 4191-93 their blood 1818 [shall be] upon them.

20:14 And if a man 376 take 3947-4 a wife 802 and her mother, 517 it [is] wickedness: 2154 they shall be burnt 8313-4 with fire, 784 both he and they; that there be no wickedness 2154 among 8432 you.

20:15 And if a man 376 lie 5414-4 7903 with a beast, 929 he shall surely 4191-2 be put to death: 4191-93 and ye shall slay 2026-4 the beast. 929

20:16 And if a woman 802 approach 7126-4 unto any beast, 929 and lie down 7250-2 thereto, thou shalt kill 2026-1 the woman, 802 and the beast: 929 they shall surely 4191-2 be put to death; 4191-93 their blood 1818 [shall be] upon them.

20:17 And if a man 376 shall take 3947-4 his sister, 269 his father's 1 daughter, 1323 or 176 his mother's 517 daughter, 1323 and see 7200-1 her nakedness, 6172 and she see 7200-4 his nakedness; 6172 it [is] a wicked thing; 2617 and they shall be cut off 3772-8 in the sight 5869 of their people: 5971 1121 he hath uncovered 1540-14 his sister's 269 nakedness; 6172 he shall bear 5375-4 his iniquity. 5771

20:18 And if a man 376 shall lie 7901-4 with a woman 802 having her sickness, 1739 and shall uncover 1540-14 her nakedness; 6172 he hath discovered 6168-52 her fountain, 4726 and she hath uncovered 1540-14 the fountain 4726 of her blood: 1818 and both 8147 of them shall be cut off 3772-8 from among 7130 their people. 5971

20:19 And thou shalt not uncover 1540-17 the nakedness 6172 of thy mother's 517 sister, 269 nor of thy father's 1 sister: 269 for he uncovereth 6168-52 his near kin: 7607 they shall bear 5375-4 their iniquity. 5771

20:20 And if a man 376 shall lie 7901-4 with his uncle's wife, 1733 he hath uncovered 1540-14 his uncle's 1730 nakedness: 6172 they shall bear 5375-4 their sin; 2399 they shall die 4191-4 childless. 6185

20:21 And if a man 376 shall take 3947-4 his brother's 251 wife, 802 it [is] an unclean thing: 5079 he hath uncovered 1540-14 his brother's 251 nakedness; 6172 they shall be childless. 6185

20:22 Ye shall therefore keep 8104-1 all my statutes, 2708 and all my judgments, 4941 and do 6213-1 them: that the land, 776 whither I bring 935-56 you to dwell 3427-2 therein, spue 6958-55 you not out.

20:23 And ye shall not walk 3212-4 in the manners 2708 of the nation, 1471 which I cast out 7971-18 before 6440 you: for they committed 6213-1 all these things, and therefore I abhorred 6973-4 them.

20:24 But I have said 559-4 unto you, Ye shall inherit 3423-4 their land, 127 and I will give 5414-4 it unto you to possess 3423-2 it, a land 776 that floweth 2100-6 with milk 2461 and honey: 1706 I [am] the LORD 3068 your God, 430 which have separated 914-52 you from [other] people. 5971

20:25 Ye shall therefore put difference 914-52 between clean 2889 beasts 929 and unclean, 2931 and between unclean 2931 fowls 5775 and clean: 2889 and ye shall not make your souls 5315 abominable 8262-17 by beast, 929 or by fowl, 5775 or by any manner of living thing that creepeth 7430-4 on the ground, 127 which I have separated 914-52 from you as unclean. 2930-15

20:26 And ye shall be holy 6918 unto me: for I the LORD 3068 [am] holy, 6918 and have severed 914-55 you from [other] people, 5971 that ye should be mine.

20:27 A man 376 also or woman 802 that hath 3588 a familiar spirit, 178 or that is a wizard, 3049 shall surely 4191-2 be put to death: 4191-93 they shall stone 7275-4 them with stones: 68 their blood 1818 [shall be] upon them.

21:1 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Speak 559-3 unto the priests 3548 the sons 1121 of Aaron, 175 and say 559-1 unto them, There shall none be defiled 2930-101 for the dead 5315 among his people: 5971

21:2 But for his kin, 7607 that is near 7138 unto him, [that is], for his mother, 517 and for his father, 1 and for his son, 1121 and for his daughter, 1323 and for his brother, 251

21:3 And for his sister 269 a virgin, 1330 that is nigh 7138 unto him, which hath had no husband; 376 for her may he be defiled. 2930-101

21:4 [But] he shall not defile 2930-101 himself, [being] a chief man 1167 among his people, 5971 to profane 2490-9 himself.

21:5 They shall not make 7139-4 baldness 7144 upon their head, 7218 neither shall they shave off 1548-17 the corner 6285 of their beard, 2206 nor make 8295-4 any cuttings 8296 in their flesh. 1320

21:6 They shall be holy 6944 unto their God, 430 and not profane 2490-17 the name 8034 of their God: 430 for the offerings of the LORD 3068 made by fire, 801 [and] the bread 3899 of their God, 430 they do offer: 7126-56 therefore they shall be holy. 6918

21:7 They shall not take 3947-4 a wife 802 [that is] a whore, 2181-6 or profane; 2491 neither shall they take 3947-4 a woman 802 put away 1644-7 from her husband: 376 for he [is] holy 6918 unto his God. 430

21:8 Thou shalt sanctify 6942-14 him therefore; for he offereth 7126-56 the bread 3899 of thy God: 430 he shall be holy 6918 unto thee: for I the LORD, 3068 which sanctify 6942-18 you, [am] holy. 6918

21:9 And the daughter 1323 of any 376 priest, 3548 if she profane 2490-11 herself by playing the whore, 2181-2 she profaneth 2490-18 her father: 1 she shall be burnt 8313-11 with fire. 784

21:10 And [he that is] the high 1419 priest 3548 among his brethren, 251 upon whose head 7218 the anointing 4888 oil 8081 was poured, 3332-93 and that is consecrated 4390-14 3027 to put on 3847-2 the garments, 899 shall not uncover 6544-4 his head, 7218 nor rend 6533-4 his clothes; 899

21:11 Neither shall he go in 935-4 to any dead 4191-5 body, 5315 nor defile 2930-101 himself for his father, 1 or for his mother; 517

21:12 Neither shall he go out 3318-4 of the sanctuary, 4720 nor profane 2490-17 the sanctuary 4720 of his God; 430 for the crown 5145 of the anointing 4888 oil 8081 of his God 430 [is] upon him: I [am] the LORD. 3068

21:13 And he shall take 3947-4 a wife 802 in her virginity. 1331

21:14 A widow, 490 or a divorced woman, 1644-7 or profane, 2491 [or] an harlot, 2181-6 these shall he not take: 3947-4 but he shall take 3947-4 a virgin 1330 of his own people 5971 to wife. 802

21:15 Neither shall he profane 2490-17 his seed 2233 among his people: 5971 for I the LORD 3068 do sanctify 6942-18 him.

21:16 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

21:17 Speak 1696-16 unto Aaron, 175 saying, 559-2 Whosoever 376 [he be] of thy seed 2233 in their generations 1755 that hath [any] blemish, 3971 let him not approach 7126-4 to offer 7126-53 the bread 3899 of his God. 430

21:18 For whatsoever man 376 [he be] that hath a blemish, 3971 he shall not approach: 7126-4 a blind 5787 man, 376 or a lame, 6455 or he that hath a flat nose, 2763-7 or any thing superfluous, 8311-7

21:19 Or a man 376 that is brokenfooted, 7667 7272 or brokenhanded, 7667 3027

21:20 Or crookbackt, 1384 or a dwarf, 1851 or that hath a blemish 8400 in his eye, 5869 or be scurvy, 1618 or scabbed, 3217 or hath his stones 810 broken; 4790

21:21 No man 376 that hath a blemish 3971 of the seed 2233 of Aaron 175 the priest 3548 shall come nigh 5066-4 to offer 7126-53 the offerings of the LORD 3068 made by fire: 801 he hath a blemish; 3971 he shall not come nigh 5066-4 to offer 7126-53 the bread 3899 of his God. 430

21:22 He shall eat 398-4 the bread 3899 of his God, 430 [both] of the most 6944 holy, 6944 and of the holy. 6944

21:23 Only he shall not go in 935-4 unto the vail, 6532 nor come nigh 5066-4 unto the altar, 4196 because he hath a blemish; 3971 that he profane 2490-17 not my sanctuaries: 4720 for I the LORD 3068 do sanctify 6942-18 them.

21:24 And Moses 4872 told 1696-17 [it] unto Aaron, 175 and to his sons, 1121 and unto all the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

22:1 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

22:2 Speak 1696-16 unto Aaron 175 and to his sons, 1121 that they separate 5144-11 themselves from the holy things 6944 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and that they profane 2490-17 not my holy 6944 name 8034 [in those things] which they hallow 6942-56 unto me: I [am] the LORD. 3068

22:3 Say 559-3 unto them, Whosoever 376 [he be] of all your seed 2233 among your generations, 1755 that goeth 7126-4 unto the holy things, 6944 which the children 1121 of Israel 3478 hallow 6942-55 unto the LORD, 3068 having his uncleanness 2932 upon him, that soul 5315 shall be cut off 3772-8 from my presence: 6440 I [am] the LORD. 3068

22:4 What man 376 soever 376 of the seed 2233 of Aaron 175 [is] a leper, 6879-7 or hath a running issue; 2100-6 he shall not eat 398-4 of the holy things, 6944 until he be clean. 2891-4 And whoso toucheth 5060-6 any thing [that is] unclean 2931 [by] the dead, 5315 or a man 376 whose seed 2233 7902 goeth 3318-4 from him;

22:5 Or whosoever 376 toucheth 5060-4 any creeping thing, 8318 whereby he may be made unclean, 2930-4 or a man 120 of whom he may take uncleanness, 2930-4 whatsoever uncleanness 2932 he hath;

22:6 The soul 5315 which hath touched 5060-4 any such shall be unclean 2930-1 until even, 6153 and shall not eat 398-4 of the holy things, 6944 unless 518 he wash 7364-1 his flesh 1320 with water. 4325

22:7 And when the sun 8121 is down, 935-1 he shall be clean, 2891-1 and shall afterward 310 eat 398-4 of the holy things; 6944 because it [is] his food. 3899

22:8 That which dieth of itself, 5038 or is torn 2966 [with beasts], he shall not eat 398-4 to defile 2930-2 himself therewith: I [am] the LORD. 3068

22:9 They shall therefore keep 8104-1 mine ordinance, 4931 lest they bear 5375-4 sin 2399 for it, and die 4191-1 therefore, if they profane 2490-17 it: I the LORD 3068 do sanctify 6942-18 them.

22:10 There shall no stranger 2114-5 eat 398-4 [of] the holy thing: 6944 a sojourner 8453 of the priest, 3548 or an hired servant, 7916 shall not eat 398-4 [of] the holy thing. 6944

22:11 But if the priest 3548 buy 7069-4 [any] soul 5315 with 7075 his money, 3701 he shall eat 398-4 of it, and he that is born 3211 in his house: 1004 they shall eat 398-4 of his meat. 3899

22:12 If the priest's 3548 daughter 1323 also be [married] unto a stranger, 376 2114-5 she may not eat 398-4 of an offering 8641 of the holy things. 6944

22:13 But if the priest's 3548 daughter 1323 be a widow, 490 or divorced, 1644-7 and have no child, 2233 and is returned 7725-1 unto her father's 1 house, 1004 as in her youth, 5271 she shall eat 398-4 of her father's 1 meat: 3899 but there shall no stranger 2114-5 eat 398-4 thereof.

22:14 And if a man 376 eat 398-4 [of] the holy thing 6944 unwittingly, 7684 then he shall put 3254-1 the fifth 2549 [part] thereof unto it, and shall give 5414-1 [it] unto the priest 3548 with the holy thing. 6944

22:15 And they shall not profane 2490-17 the holy things 6944 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 which they offer 7311-55 unto the LORD; 3068

22:16 Or suffer them to bear 5375-52 the iniquity 5771 of trespass, 819 when they eat 398-2 their holy things: 6944 for I the LORD 3068 do sanctify 6942-18 them.

22:17 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

22:18 Speak 1696-16 unto Aaron, 175 and to his sons, 1121 and unto all the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and say 559-1 unto them, Whatsoever 376 376 [he be] of the house 1004 of Israel, 3478 or of the strangers 1616 in Israel, 3478 that will offer 7126-55 his oblation 7133 for all his vows, 5088 and for all his freewill offerings, 5071 which they will offer 7126-55 unto the LORD 3068 for a burnt offering; 5930

22:19 [Ye shall offer] at your own will 7522 a male 2145 without blemish, 8549 of the beeves, 1241 of the sheep, 3775 or of the goats. 5795

22:20 [But] whatsoever hath a blemish, 3971 [that] shall ye not offer: 7126-55 for it shall not be acceptable 7522 for you.

22:21 And whosoever 376 offereth 7126-55 a sacrifice 2077 of peace offerings 8002 unto the LORD 3068 to accomplish 6381-15 [his] vow, 5088 or a freewill offering 5071 in beeves 1241 or sheep, 6629 it shall be perfect 8549 to be accepted; 7522 there shall be no blemish 3971 therein.

22:22 Blind, 5788 or broken, 7665-7 or maimed, 2782-7 or having a wen, 2990 or scurvy, 1618 or scabbed, 3217 ye shall not offer 7126-55 these unto the LORD, 3068 nor make 5414-4 an offering by fire 801 of them upon the altar 4196 unto the LORD. 3068

22:23 Either a bullock 7794 or a lamb 7716 that hath any thing superfluous 8311-7 or lacking in his parts, 7038-7 that mayest thou offer 6213-4 [for] a freewill offering; 5071 but for a vow 5088 it shall not be accepted. 7521-11

22:24 Ye shall not offer 7126-55 unto the LORD 3068 that which is bruised, 4600-7 or crushed, 3807-7 or broken, 5423-7 or cut; 3772-7 neither shall ye make 6213-4 [any offering thereof] in your land. 776

22:25 Neither from a stranger's 5236 1121 hand 3027 shall ye offer 7126-55 the bread 3899 of your God 430 of any of these; because their corruption 4893 [is] in them, [and] blemishes 3971 [be] in them: they shall not be accepted 7521-11 for you.

22:26 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

22:27 When a bullock, 7794 or a sheep, 3775 or a goat, 5795 is brought forth, 3205-11 then it shall be seven 7651 days 3117 under the dam; 517 and from the eighth 8066 day 3117 and thenceforth 1973 it shall be accepted 7521-11 for an offering 7133 made by fire 801 unto the LORD. 3068

22:28 And [whether it be] cow 7794 or ewe, 7716 ye shall not kill 7819-4 it and her young 1121 both in one 259 day. 3117

22:29 And when ye will offer 2076-4 a sacrifice 2077 of thanksgiving 8426 unto the LORD, 3068 offer 2076-4 [it] at your own will. 7522

22:30 On the same day 3117 it shall be eaten 398-11 up; ye shall leave 3498-55 none of it until the morrow: 1242 I [am] the LORD. 3068

22:31 Therefore shall ye keep 8104-1 my commandments, 4687 and do 6213-1 them: I [am] the LORD. 3068

22:32 Neither shall ye profane 2490-17 my holy 6944 name; 8034 but I will be hallowed 6942-8 among 8432 the children 1121 of Israel: 3478 I [am] the LORD 3068 which hallow 6942-18 you,

22:33 That brought you out 3318-56 of the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 to be your God: 430 I [am] the LORD. 3068

23:1 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

23:2 Speak 1696-16 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and say 559-1 unto them, [Concerning] the feasts 4150 of the LORD, 3068 which ye shall proclaim 7121-4 [to be] holy 6944 convocations, 4744 [even] these [are] my feasts. 4150

23:3 Six 8337 days 3117 shall work 4399 be done: 6213-11 but the seventh 7637 day 3117 [is] the sabbath 7676 of rest, 7677 an holy 6944 convocation; 4744 ye shall do 6213-4 no work 4399 [therein]: it [is] the sabbath 7676 of the LORD 3068 in all your dwellings. 4186

23:4 These [are] the feasts 4150 of the LORD, 3068 [even] holy 6944 convocations, 4744 which ye shall proclaim 7121-4 in their seasons. 4150

23:5 In the fourteenth 702 6240 [day] of the first 7223 month 2320 2320 at even 6153 [is] the LORD'S 3068 passover. 6453

23:6 And on the fifteenth 2568 6240 day 3117 of the same month 2320 [is] the feast 2282 of unleavened bread 4682 unto the LORD: 3068 seven 7651 days 3117 ye must eat 398-4 unleavened bread. 4682

23:7 In the first 7223 day 3117 ye shall have an holy 6944 convocation: 4744 ye shall do 6213-4 no servile 5656 work 4399 therein.

23:8 But ye shall offer 7126-52 an offering made by fire 801 unto the LORD 3068 seven 7651 days: 3117 in the seventh 7637 day 3117 [is] an holy 6944 convocation: 4744 ye shall do 6213-4 no servile 5656 work 4399 [therein].

23:9 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

23:10 Speak 1696-16 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and say 559-1 unto them, When ye be come 935-4 into the land 776 which I give 5414-6 unto you, and shall reap 7114-1 the harvest 7105 thereof, then ye shall bring 935-52 a sheaf 6016 of the firstfruits 7225 of your harvest 7105 unto the priest: 3548

23:11 And he shall wave 5130-52 the sheaf 6016 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 to be accepted 7522 for you: on the morrow 4283 after the sabbath 7676 the priest 3548 shall wave 5130-55 it.

23:12 And ye shall offer 6213-1 that day 3117 when ye wave 5130-53 the sheaf 6016 an he lamb 3532 without blemish 8549 of the first 1121 year 8141 for a burnt offering 5930 unto the LORD. 3068

23:13 And the meat offering 4503 thereof [shall be] two 8147 tenth deals 6241 of fine flour 5560 mingled 1101-7 with oil, 8081 an offering made by fire 801 unto the LORD 3068 [for] a sweet 5207 savour: 7381 and the drink offering 5262 thereof [shall be] of wine, 3196 the fourth 7243 [part] of an hin. 1969

23:14 And ye shall eat 398-4 neither bread, 3899 nor parched corn, 7039 nor green ears, 3759 until the selfsame 6106 2088 day 3117 that 5704 ye have brought 935-53 an offering 7133 unto your God: 430 [it shall be] a statute 2708 for ever 5769 throughout your generations 1755 in all your dwellings. 4186

23:15 And ye shall count 5608-1 unto you from the morrow 4283 after the sabbath, 7676 from the day 3117 that ye brought 935-53 the sheaf 6016 of the wave offering; 8573 seven 7651 sabbaths 7676 shall be 1961-4 complete: 8549

23:16 Even 5704 unto the morrow 4283 after the seventh 7637 sabbath 7676 shall ye number 5608-4 fifty 2572 days; 3117 and ye shall offer 7126-52 a new 2319 meat offering 4503 unto the LORD. 3068

23:17 Ye shall bring 935-55 out of your habitations 4186 two 8147 wave 8573 loaves 3899 of two 8147 tenth deals: 6241 they shall be of fine flour; 5560 they shall be baken 644-11 with leaven; 2557 [they are] the firstfruits 1061 unto the LORD. 3068

23:23 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

23:24 Speak 1696-16 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 saying, 559-2 In the seventh 7637 month, 2320 in the first 259 [day] of the month, 2320 shall ye have a sabbath, 7677 a memorial 2146 of blowing 8643 of trumpets, an holy 6944 convocation. 4744

23:26 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

23:27 Also 389 on the tenth 6218 [day] of this seventh 7637 month 2320 [there shall be] a day 3117 of atonement: 3725 it shall be an holy 6944 convocation 4744 unto you; and ye shall afflict 6031-14 your souls, 5315 and offer 7126-52 an offering made by fire 801 unto the LORD. 3068

23:28 And ye shall do 6213-4 no work 4399 in that same 6106 day: 3117 for it [is] a day 3117 of atonement, 3725 to make an atonement 3722-15 for you before 6440 the LORD 3068 your God. 430

23:29 For whatsoever soul 5315 [it be] that shall not be afflicted 6031-29 in that same 6106 day, 3117 he shall be cut off 3772-8 from among his people. 5971

23:30 And whatsoever soul 5315 [it be] that doeth 6213-4 any work 4399 in that same 6106 day, 3117 the same soul 5315 will I destroy 6-52 from among 7130 his people. 5971

23:31 Ye shall do 6213-4 no manner of work: 4399 [it shall be] a statute 2708 for ever 5769 throughout your generations 1755 in all your dwellings. 4186

23:32 It [shall be] unto you a sabbath 7676 of rest, 7677 and ye shall afflict 6031-14 your souls: 5315 in the ninth 8672 [day] of the month 2320 at even, 6153 from even 6153 unto even, 6153 shall ye celebrate 7673-4 your sabbath. 7676

23:33 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

23:34 Speak 1696-16 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 saying, 559-2 The fifteenth 2568 6240 day 3117 of this seventh 7637 month 2320 [shall be] the feast 2282 of tabernacles 5521 [for] seven 7651 days 3117 unto the LORD. 3068

23:37 These [are] the feasts 4150 of the LORD, 3068 which ye shall proclaim 7121-4 [to be] holy 6944 convocations, 4744 to offer 7126-53 an offering made by fire 801 unto the LORD, 3068 a burnt offering, 5930 and a meat offering, 4503 a sacrifice, 2077 and drink offerings, 5262 every thing 1697 upon his day: 3117 3117

23:38 Beside the sabbaths 7676 of the LORD, 3068 and beside your gifts, 4979 and beside all your vows, 5088 and beside all your freewill offerings, 5071 which ye give 5414-4 unto the LORD. 3068

23:39 Also in the fifteenth 2568 6240 day 3117 of the seventh 7637 month, 2320 when ye have gathered 622-2 in the fruit 8393 of the land, 776 ye shall keep 2287-4 a feast 2282 unto the LORD 3068 seven 7651 days: 3117 on the first 7223 day 3117 [shall be] a sabbath, 7677 and on the eighth 8066 day 3117 [shall be] a sabbath. 7677

23:42 Ye shall dwell 3427-4 in booths 5521 seven 7651 days; 3117 all that are Israelites 3478 born 249 shall dwell 3427-4 in booths: 5521

23:43 That your generations 1755 may know 3045-4 that I made the children 1121 of Israel 3478 to dwell 3427-52 in booths, 5521 when I brought them out 3318-53 of the land 776 of Egypt: 4714 I [am] the LORD 3068 your God. 430

23:44 And Moses 4872 declared 1696-17 unto the children 1121 of Israel 3478 the feasts 4150 of the LORD. 3068

24:1 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

24:2 Command 6680-16 the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 that they bring 3947-4 unto thee pure 2134 oil 8081 olive 2132 beaten 3795 for the light, 3974 to cause the lamps 5216 to burn 5927-53 continually. 8548

24:3 Without 2351 the vail 6532 of the testimony, 5715 in the tabernacle 168 of the congregation, 4150 shall Aaron 175 order 6186-4 it from the evening 6153 unto the morning 1242 before 6440 the LORD 3068 continually: 8548 [it shall be] a statute 2708 for ever 5769 in your generations. 1755

24:4 He shall order 6186-4 the lamps 5216 upon the pure 2889 candlestick 4501 before 6440 the LORD 3068 continually. 8548

24:5 And thou shalt take 3947-1 fine flour, 5560 and bake 644-1 twelve 6240 8147 cakes 2471 thereof: two 8147 tenth deals 6241 shall be in one 259 cake. 2471

24:6 And thou shalt set 7760-1 them in two 8147 rows, 4634 six 8337 on a row, 4635 upon the pure 2889 table 7979 before 6440 the LORD. 3068

24:7 And thou shalt put 5414-1 pure 2134 frankincense 3828 upon [each] row, 4635 that it may be on the bread 3899 for a memorial, 234 [even] an offering made by fire 801 unto the LORD. 3068

24:8 Every sabbath 7676 3117 7676 3117 he shall set it in order 6186-4 before 6440 the LORD 3068 continually, 8548 [being taken] from the children 1121 of Israel 3478 by an everlasting 5769 covenant. 1285

24:9 And it shall be Aaron's 175 and his sons'; 1121 and they shall eat 398-1 it in the holy 6918 place: 4725 for it [is] most 6944 holy 6944 unto him of the offerings of the LORD 3068 made by fire 801 by a perpetual 5769 statute. 2706

24:10 And the son 1121 of an Israelitish 3482 woman, 802 whose father 1121 [was] an Egyptian, 376 4713 went out 3318-4 among 8432 the children 1121 of Israel: 3478 and this son 1121 of the Israelitish 3482 [woman] and a man 376 of Israel 3481|3478 strove 5327-11 together in the camp; 4264

24:11 And the Israelitish 3482 woman's 802 son 1121 blasphemed 5344-4 the name 8034 [of the LORD], and cursed. 7043-17 And they brought 935-55 him unto Moses: 4872 (and his mother's 517 name 8034 [was] Shelomith, 8019 the daughter 1323 of Dibri, 1704 of the tribe 4294 of Dan:) 1835

24:12 And they put 3240-55 him in ward, 4929 that the mind 6310 of the LORD 3068 might be shewed 6567-2 them.

24:13 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

24:14 Bring forth 3318-54 him that hath cursed 7043-18 without 2351 the camp; 4264 and let all that heard 8085-6 [him] lay 5564-1 their hands 3027 upon his head, 7218 and let all the congregation 5712 stone 7275-1 him.

24:15 And thou shalt speak 1696-17 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 saying, 559-2 Whosoever 376 376 3588 curseth 7043-17 his God 430 shall bear 5375-1 his sin. 2399

24:16 And he that blasphemeth 5344-6 the name 8034 of the LORD, 3068 he shall surely 4191-2 be put to death, 4191-93 [and] all the congregation 5712 shall certainly 7275-2 stone 7275-4 him: as well the stranger, 1616 as he that is born in the land, 249 when he blasphemeth 5344-2 the name 8034 [of the LORD], shall be put to death. 4191-93

24:17 And he 376 that killeth 5221-55 any 5315 man 120 shall surely 4191-2 be put to death. 4191-93

24:18 And he that killeth 5221-56 5315 a beast 929 shall make it good; 7999-17 beast 5315 for beast. 5315

24:19 And if a man 376 cause 5414-4 a blemish 3971 in his neighbour; 5997 as he hath done, 6213-1 so shall it be done 6213-11 to him;

24:20 Breach 7667 for breach, 7667 eye 5869 for eye, 5869 tooth 8127 for tooth: 8127 as he hath caused 5414-4 a blemish 3971 in a man, 120 so shall it be done 5414-11 to him [again].

24:21 And he that killeth 5221-56 a beast, 929 he shall restore 7999-17 it: and he that killeth 5221-56 a man, 120 he shall be put to death. 4191-93

24:22 Ye shall have one 259 manner of law, 4941 as well for the stranger, 1616 as for one of your own country: 249 for I [am] the LORD 3068 your God. 430

24:23 And Moses 4872 spake 1696-17 to the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 that they should bring forth 3318-55 him that had cursed 7043-18 out 2351 of the camp, 4264 and stone 7275-4 him with stones. 68 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 did 6213-1 as the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses. 4872

25:1 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses 4872 in mount 2022 Sinai, 5514 saying, 559-2

25:2 Speak 1696-16 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and say 559-1 unto them, When ye come 935-4 into the land 776 which I give 5414-6 you, then shall the land 776 keep 7673-1 a sabbath 7676 unto the LORD. 3068

25:3 Six 8337 years 8141 thou shalt sow 2232-4 thy field, 7704 and six 8337 years 8141 thou shalt prune 2168-4 thy vineyard, 3754 and gather 622-1 in the fruit 8393 thereof;

25:4 But in the seventh 7637 year 8141 shall be a sabbath 7676 of rest 7677 unto the land, 776 a sabbath 7676 for the LORD: 3068 thou shalt neither sow 2232-4 thy field, 7704 nor prune 2168-4 thy vineyard. 3754

25:5 That which groweth of its own accord 5599 of thy harvest 7105 thou shalt not reap, 7114-4 neither gather 1219-4 the grapes 6025 of thy vine undressed: 5139 [for] it is a year 8141 of rest 7677 unto the land. 776

25:6 And the sabbath 7676 of the land 776 shall be meat 402 for you; for thee, and for thy servant, 5650 and for thy maid, 519 and for thy hired servant, 7916 and for thy stranger 8453 that sojourneth 1481-6 with thee,

25:7 And for thy cattle, 929 and for the beast 2416 that [are] in thy land, 776 shall all the increase 8393 thereof be meat. 398-2

25:8 And thou shalt number 5608-1 seven 7651 sabbaths 7676 of years 8141 unto thee, seven 7651 times 6471 seven 7651 years; 8141 and the space 3117 of the seven 7651 sabbaths 7676 of years 8141 shall be unto thee forty 705 and nine 8672 years. 8141

25:9 Then shalt thou cause the trumpet 7782 of the jubile 8643 to sound 5674-52 on the tenth 6218 [day] of the seventh 7637 month, 2320 2320 in the day 3117 of atonement 3725 shall ye make the trumpet 7782 sound 5674-55 throughout all your land. 776

25:10 And ye shall hallow 6942-14 the 8141 fiftieth 2572 year, 8141 and proclaim 7121-1 liberty 1865 throughout [all] the land 776 unto all the inhabitants 3427-6 thereof: it shall be a jubile 3104 unto you; and ye shall return 7725-1 every man 376 unto his possession, 272 and ye shall return 7725-4 every man 376 unto his family. 4940

25:11 A jubile 3104 shall that 8141 fiftieth 2572 year 8141 be unto you: ye shall not sow, 2232-4 neither reap 7114-4 that which groweth of itself 5599 in it, nor gather 1219-4 [the grapes] in it of thy vine undressed. 5139

25:12 For it [is] the jubile; 3104 it shall be holy 6944 unto you: ye shall eat 398-4 the increase 8393 thereof out of the field. 7704

25:13 In the year 8141 of this jubile 3104 ye shall return 7725-4 every man 376 unto his possession. 272

25:14 And if thou sell 4376-4 ought 4465 unto thy neighbour, 5997 or buyest 7069-2 [ought] of thy neighbour's 5997 hand, 3027 ye shall not oppress 3238-55 one 376 another: 251

25:15 According to the number 4557 of years 8141 after 310 the jubile 3104 thou shalt buy 7069-4 of thy neighbour, 5997 [and] according unto the number 4557 of years 8141 of the fruits 8393 he shall sell 4376-4 unto thee:

25:16 According 6310 to the multitude 7230 of years 8141 thou shalt increase 7235-55 the price 4736 thereof, and according 6310 to the fewness 4591-2 of years 8141 thou shalt diminish 4591-55 the price 4736 of it: for [according] to the number 4557 [of the years] of the fruits 8393 doth he sell 4376-6 unto thee.

25:17 Ye shall not therefore oppress 3238-55 one 376 another; 5997 but thou shalt fear 3372-1 thy God: 430 for I [am] the LORD 3068 your God. 430

25:18 Wherefore ye shall do 6213-1 my statutes, 2708 and keep 8104-4 my judgments, 4941 and do 6213-1 them; and ye shall dwell 3427-1 in the land 776 in safety. 983

25:19 And the land 776 shall yield 5414-1 her fruit, 6529 and ye shall eat 398-1 your fill, 7648 and dwell 3427-1 therein in safety. 983

25:20 And if ye shall say, 559-4 What shall we eat 398-4 the seventh 7637 year? 8141 behold, we shall not sow, 2232-4 nor gather 622-4 in our increase: 8393

25:21 Then I will command 6680-14 my blessing 1293 upon you in the sixth 8345 year, 8141 and it shall bring forth 6213-1 fruit 8393 for three 7969 years. 8141

25:22 And ye shall sow 2232-1 the eighth 8066 year, 8141 and eat 398-1 [yet] of old 3465 fruit 8393 until the ninth 8671 year; 8141 until her fruits 8393 come in 935-2 ye shall eat 398-4 [of] the old 3465 [store].

25:23 The land 776 shall not be sold 4376-11 for ever: 6783 for the land 776 [is] mine; for ye [are] strangers 1616 and sojourners 8453 with me.

25:24 And in all the land 776 of your possession 272 ye shall grant 5414-4 a redemption 1353 for the land. 776

25:25 If thy brother 251 be waxen poor, 4134-4 and hath sold 4376-1 away [some] of his possession, 272 and if any of his kin 7138 come 935-1 to redeem 1350-6 it, then shall he redeem 1350-1 that which his brother 251 sold. 4465

25:26 And if the man 376 have none to redeem 1350-6 it, and himself 3027 be able 1767 5381-52 to redeem 4672-1 1353 it;

25:27 Then let him count 2803-14 the years 8141 of the sale 4465 thereof, and restore 7725-52 the overplus 5736-6 unto the man 376 to whom he sold 4376-1 it; that he may return 7725-1 unto his possession. 272

25:28 But if he 3027 be not able 1767 to restore 4672-1 7725-53 [it] to him, then that which is sold 4465 shall remain in the hand 3027 of him that hath bought 7069-6 it until the year 8141 of jubile: 3104 and in the jubile 3104 it shall go out, 3318-1 and he shall return 7725-1 unto his possession. 272

25:29 And if a man 376 sell 4376-4 a dwelling 4186 house 1004 in a walled 2346 city, 5892 then he may redeem 1353 it within a whole 8552-2 year 8141 after it is sold; 4465 [within] a full year 3117 may he redeem 1353 it.

25:30 And if it be not redeemed 1350-11 within the space 4390-2 of a full 8549 year, 8141 then the house 1004 that [is] in the walled 2346 city 5892 shall be established 6965-1 for ever 6783 to him that bought 7069-6 it throughout his generations: 1755 it shall not go out 3318-4 in the jubile. 3104

25:31 But the houses 1004 of the villages 2691 which have no wall 2346 round about 5439 them shall be counted 2803-11 as the fields 7704 of the country: 776 they may be redeemed, 1353 and they shall go out 3318-4 in the jubile. 3104

25:32 Notwithstanding the cities 5892 of the Levites, 3881 [and] the houses 1004 of the cities 5892 of their possession, 272 may the Levites 3881 redeem 1353 at any time. 5769

25:33 And if a man purchase 1350-4 of the Levites, 3881 then the house 1004 that was sold, 4465 and the city 5892 of his possession, 272 shall go out 3318-1 in [the year of] jubile: 3104 for the houses 1004 of the cities 5892 of the Levites 3881 [are] their possession 272 among 8432 the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

25:34 But the field 7704 of the suburbs 4054 of their cities 5892 may not be sold; 4376-11 for it [is] their perpetual 5769 possession. 272

25:35 And if thy brother 251 be waxen poor, 4134-4 and fallen in decay 4131-1 with thee; 3027 then thou shalt relieve 2388-52 him: [yea, though he be] a stranger, 1616 or a sojourner; 8453 that he may live 2416 with thee.

25:36 Take 3947-4 thou no usury 5392 of him, or increase: 8636 but fear 3372-1 thy God; 430 that thy brother 251 may live 2416 with thee.

25:37 Thou shalt not give 5414-4 him thy money 3701 upon usury, 5392 nor lend 5414-4 him thy victuals 400 for increase. 4768

25:38 I [am] the LORD 3068 your God, 430 which brought you forth 3318-52 out of the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 to give 5414-2 you the land 776 of Canaan, 3667 [and] to be your God. 430

25:39 And if thy brother 251 [that dwelleth] by thee be waxen poor, 4134-4 and be sold 4376-8 unto thee; thou shalt not compel 5647-4 him to serve 5656 as a bondservant: 5650

25:40 [But] as an hired servant, 7916 [and] as a sojourner, 8453 he shall be with thee, [and] shall serve 5647-4 thee unto the year 8141 of jubile: 3104

25:41 And [then] shall he depart 3318-1 from thee, [both] he and his children 1121 with him, and shall return 7725-1 unto his own family, 4940 and unto the possession 272 of his fathers 1 shall he return. 7725-4

25:42 For they [are] my servants, 5650 which I brought forth 3318-52 out of the land 776 of Egypt: 4714 they shall not be sold 4376-11 as 4466 bondmen. 5650

25:43 Thou shalt not rule 7287-4 over him with rigour; 6531 but shalt fear 3372-1 thy God. 430

25:44 Both thy bondmen, 5650 and thy bondmaids, 519 which thou shalt have, [shall be] of the heathen 1471 that are round about 5439 you; of them shall ye buy 7069-4 bondmen 5650 and bondmaids. 519

25:45 Moreover of the children 1121 of the strangers 8453 that do sojourn 1481-6 among you, of them shall ye buy, 7069-4 and of their families 4940 that [are] with you, which they begat 3205-52 in your land: 776 and they shall be your possession. 272

25:46 And ye shall take them as an inheritance 5157-98 for your children 1121 after 310 you, to inherit 3423-2 [them for] a possession; 272 they shall be your bondmen 5647-4 for ever: 5769 but over your brethren 251 the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 ye shall not rule 7287-4 one 376 over another 251 with rigour. 6531

25:47 And if a sojourner 1616 or stranger 8453 wax rich 3027 5381-55 by thee, and thy brother 251 [that dwelleth] by him wax poor, 4134-6 and sell 4376-8 himself unto the stranger 1616 [or] sojourner 8453 by thee, or to the stock 6133 of the stranger's 1616 family: 4940

25:48 After 310 that he is sold 4376-8 he may be redeemed 1353 again; one 259 of his brethren 251 may redeem 1350-4 him:

25:49 Either his uncle, 1730 or his uncle's 1730 son, 1121 may redeem 1350-4 him, or [any] that is nigh 7607 of kin 1320 unto him of his family 4940 may redeem 1350-4 him; or if he be able, 3027 5381-52 he may redeem 1350-8 himself.

25:50 And he shall reckon 2803-14 with him that bought 7069-6 him from the year 8141 that he was sold 4376-9 to him unto the year 8141 of jubile: 3104 and the price 3701 of his sale 4465 shall be according unto the number 4557 of years, 8141 according to the time 3117 of an hired servant 7916 shall it be with him.

25:51 If [there be] yet many 7227 years 8141 [behind], according 6310 unto them he shall give again 7725-55 the price of his redemption 1353 out of the money 3701 that he was bought 4736 for.

25:52 And if there remain 7604-8 but few 4592 years 8141 unto the year 8141 of jubile, 3104 then he shall count 2803-14 with him, [and] according 6310 unto his years 8141 shall he give him again 7725-55 the price of his redemption. 1353

25:53 [And] as a yearly 8141 8141 hired servant 7916 shall he be with him: [and the other] shall not rule 7287-4 with rigour 6531 over him in thy sight. 5869

25:54 And if he be not redeemed 1350-11 in these [years], then he shall go out 3318-1 in the year 8141 of jubile, 3104 [both] he, and his children 1121 with him.

25:55 For unto me the children 1121 of Israel 3478 [are] servants; 5650 they [are] my servants 5650 whom I brought forth 3318-52 out of the land 776 of Egypt: 4714 I [am] the LORD 3068 your God. 430

26:1 Ye shall make 6213-4 you no idols 457 nor graven image, 6459 neither rear you up 6965-55 a standing image, 4676 neither shall ye set 5414-4 up [any] image 4906 of stone 68 in your land, 776 to bow down 7812-99 unto it: for I [am] the LORD 3068 your God. 430

26:2 Ye shall keep 8104-4 my sabbaths, 7676 and reverence 3372-4 my sanctuary: 4720 I [am] the LORD. 3068

26:3 If ye walk 3212-4 in my statutes, 2708 and keep 8104-4 my commandments, 4687 and do 6213-1 them;

26:4 Then I will give 5414-1 you rain 1653 in due season, 6256 and the land 776 shall yield 5414-1 her increase, 2981 and the trees 6086 of the field 7704 shall yield 5414-4 their fruit. 6529

26:5 And your threshing 1786 shall reach 5381-52 unto the vintage, 1210 and the vintage 1210 shall reach 5381-55 unto the sowing time: 2233 and ye shall eat 398-1 your bread 3899 to the full, 7648 and dwell 3427-1 in your land 776 safely. 983

26:6 And I will give 5414-1 peace 7965 in the land, 776 and ye shall lie down, 7901-1 and none shall make [you] afraid: 2729-56 and I will rid 7673-52 evil 7451 beasts 2416 out of the land, 776 neither shall the sword 2719 go 5674-4 through your land. 776

26:7 And ye shall chase 7291-1 your enemies, 341-6 and they shall fall 5307-1 before 6440 you by the sword. 2719

26:8 And five 2568 of you shall chase 7291-1 an hundred, 3967 and an hundred 3967 of you shall put ten thousand 7233 to flight: 7291-4 and your enemies 341-6 shall fall 5307-1 before 6440 you by the sword. 2719

26:9 For I will have respect 6437-1 unto you, and make you fruitful, 6509-52 and multiply 7235-52 you, and establish 6965-52 my covenant 1285 with you.

26:10 And ye shall eat 398-1 old 3465 store, 3462-12 and bring forth 3318-55 the old 3465 because 6440 of the new. 2319

26:11 And I will set 5414-1 my tabernacle 4908 among 8432 you: and my soul 5315 shall not abhor 1602-4 you.

26:12 And I will walk 1980-98 among 8432 you, and will be 1961-4 your God, 430 and ye shall be 1961-4 my people. 5971

26:13 I [am] the LORD 3068 your God, 430 which brought you forth 3318-52 out of the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 that ye should not be their bondmen; 5650 and I have broken 7665-4 the bands 4133 of your yoke, 5923 and made you go 3212-55 upright. 6968

26:14 But if ye will not hearken 8085-4 unto me, and will not do 6213-4 all these commandments; 4687

26:15 And if ye shall despise 3988-4 my statutes, 2708 or if your soul 5315 abhor 1602-4 my judgments, 4941 so that ye will not do 6213-2 all my commandments, 4687 [but] that ye break 6565-53 my covenant: 1285

26:16 I also will do 6213-4 this unto you; I will even appoint 6485-52 over you terror, 928 consumption, 7829 and the burning ague, 6920 that shall consume 3615-18 the eyes, 5869 and cause sorrow 1727-56 of heart: 5315 and ye shall sow 2232-1 your seed 2233 in vain, 7385 for your enemies 341-6 shall eat 398-1 it.

26:17 And I will set 5414-1 my face 6440 against you, and ye shall be slain 5062-8 before 6440 your enemies: 341-6 they that hate 8130-6 you shall reign 7287-1 over you; and ye shall flee 5127-1 when none pursueth 7291-6 you.

26:18 And if ye will not yet 5704 for all this hearken 8085-4 unto me, then I will punish 3256-15 you seven times 7651 more 3254-1 for your sins. 2403

26:19 And I will break 7665-1 the pride 1347 of your power; 5797 and I will make 5414-1 your heaven 8064 as iron, 1270 and your earth 776 as brass: 5154

26:20 And your strength 3581 shall be spent 8552-1 in vain: 7385 for your land 776 shall not yield 5414-4 her increase, 2981 neither shall the trees 6086 of the land 776 yield 5414-4 their fruits. 6529

26:21 And if ye walk 3212-4 contrary 7147 unto me, and will 14-4 not hearken 8085-2 unto me; I will bring seven times 7651 more 3254-1 plagues 4347 upon you according to your sins. 2403

26:22 I will also send 7971-52 wild 7704 beasts 2416 among you, which shall rob you of your children, 7921-14 and destroy 3772-52 your cattle, 929 and make you few in number; 4591-52 and your [high] ways 1870 shall be desolate. 8074-8

26:23 And if ye will not be reformed 3256-11 by me by these things, but will walk 1980-1 contrary 7147 unto me;

26:24 Then will I also walk 1980-1 contrary 7147 unto you, and will punish 5221-52 you yet 1571 seven times 7651 for your sins. 2403

26:25 And I will bring 935-52 a sword 2719 upon you, that shall avenge 5358-6 the quarrel 5359 of [my] covenant: 1285 and when ye are gathered 622-8 together within 413 your cities, 5892 I will send 7971-14 the pestilence 1698 among 8432 you; and ye shall be delivered 5414-8 into the hand 3027 of the enemy. 341-6

26:26 [And] when I have broken 7665-2 the staff 4294 of your bread, 3899 ten 6235 women 802 shall bake 644-1 your bread 3899 in one 259 oven, 8574 and they shall deliver [you] your bread 3899 again 7725-52 by weight: 4948 and ye shall eat, 398-1 and not be satisfied. 7646-4

26:27 And if ye will not for all this 2063 hearken 8085-4 unto me, but walk 1980-1 contrary 7147 unto me;

26:28 Then I will walk 1980-1 contrary 7147 unto you also in fury; 2534 and I, even 637 I, will chastise 3256-14 you seven times 7651 for your sins. 2403

26:29 And ye shall eat 398-1 the flesh 1320 of your sons, 1121 and the flesh 1320 of your daughters 1323 shall ye eat. 398-4

26:30 And I will destroy 8045-52 your high places, 1116 and cut down 3772-52 your images, 2553 and cast 5414-1 your carcases 6297 upon the carcases 6297 of your idols, 1544 and my soul 5315 shall abhor 1602-1 you.

26:31 And I will make 5414-1 your cities 5892 waste, 2723 and bring your sanctuaries 4720 unto desolation, 8074-52 and I will not smell 7306-55 the savour 7381 of your sweet odours. 5207

26:32 And I will bring the land 776 into desolation: 8074-52 and your enemies 341-6 which dwell 3427-6 therein shall be astonished 8074-1 at it.

26:33 And I will scatter 2219-17 you among the heathen, 1471 and will draw out 7324-52 a sword 2719 after 310 you: and your land 776 shall be desolate, 8077 and your cities 5892 waste. 2723

26:34 Then shall the land 776 enjoy 7521-4 her sabbaths, 7676 as long as 3117 it lieth desolate, 8074-91 and ye [be] in your enemies' 341-6 land; 776 [even] then shall the land 776 rest, 7673-4 and enjoy 7521-52 her sabbaths. 7676

26:35 As long as 3117 it lieth desolate 8074-91 it shall rest; 7673-4 because it did not rest 7673-1 in your sabbaths, 7676 when ye dwelt 3427-2 upon it.

26:36 And upon them that are left 7604-12 [alive] of you I will send 935-52 a faintness 4816 into their hearts 3824 in the lands 776 of their enemies; 341-6 and the sound 6963 of a shaken 5086-12 leaf 5929 shall chase 7291-1 them; and they shall flee, 5127-1 as fleeing 4499 from a sword; 2719 and they shall fall 5307-1 when none pursueth. 7291-6

26:37 And they shall fall 3782-1 one 376 upon another, 251 as it were before 6440 a sword, 2719 when none pursueth: 7291-6 and ye shall have no power to stand 8617 before 6440 your enemies. 341-6

26:38 And ye shall perish 6-1 among the heathen, 1471 and the land 776 of your enemies 341-6 shall eat 398-1 you up.

26:39 And they that are left 7604-12 of you shall pine away 4743-11 in their iniquity 5771 in your enemies' 341-6 lands; 776 and also in the iniquities 5771 of their fathers 1 shall they pine away 4743-11 with them.

26:40 If they shall confess 3034-98 their iniquity, 5771 and the iniquity 5771 of their fathers, 1 with their trespass 4604 which they trespassed 4603-1 against me, and that also they have walked 1980-1 contrary 7147 unto me;

26:41 And [that] I also have walked 3212-4 contrary 7147 unto them, and have brought 935-52 them into the land 776 of their enemies; 341-6 if then 176 their uncircumcised 6189 hearts 3824 be humbled, 3665-11 and they then accept 7521-4 of the punishment of their iniquity: 5771

26:42 Then will I remember 2142-1 my covenant 1285 with Jacob, 3290 and also my covenant 1285 with Isaac, 3327 and also my covenant 1285 with Abraham 85 will I remember; 2142-4 and I will remember 2142-4 the land. 776

26:43 The land 776 also shall be left 5800-11 of them, and shall enjoy 7521-4 her sabbaths, 7676 while she lieth desolate 8074-91 without them: and they shall accept 7521-4 of the punishment of their iniquity: 5771 because, 3282 even because 3282 they despised 3988-1 my judgments, 4941 and because their soul 5315 abhorred 1602-1 my statutes. 2708

26:44 And yet 637 for all 1571 that, 2063 when they be in the land 776 of their enemies, 341-6 I will not cast them away, 3988-1 neither will I abhor 1602-1 them, to destroy them utterly, 3615-15 and to break 6565-53 my covenant 1285 with them: for I [am] the LORD 3068 their God. 430

26:45 But I will for their sakes remember 2142-1 the covenant 1285 of their ancestors, 7223 whom I brought forth 3318-52 out of the land 776 of Egypt 4714 in the sight 5869 of the heathen, 1471 that I might be their God: 430 I [am] the LORD. 3068

26:46 These [are] the statutes 2706 and judgments 4941 and laws, 8451 which the LORD 3068 made 5414-1 between him and the children 1121 of Israel 3478 in mount 2022 Sinai 5514 by the hand 3027 of Moses. 4872

27:1 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

27:2 Speak 1696-16 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and say 559-1 unto them, When a man 376 shall make a singular 6381-55 vow, 5088 the persons 5315 [shall be] for the LORD 3068 by thy estimation. 6187

27:3 And thy estimation 6187 shall be of the male 2145 from twenty 6242 years 8141 old 1121 even unto sixty 8346 years 8141 old, 1121 even thy estimation 6187 shall be fifty 2572 shekels 8255 of silver, 3701 after the shekel 8255 of the sanctuary. 6944

27:4 And if it [be] a female, 5347 then thy estimation 6187 shall be thirty 7970 shekels. 8255

27:5 And if [it be] from five 2568 years 8141 old 1121 even unto twenty 6242 years 8141 old, 1121 then thy estimation 6187 shall be of the male 2145 twenty 6242 shekels, 8255 and for the female 5347 ten 6235 shekels. 8255

27:6 And if [it be] from a month 2320 old 1121 even unto five 2568 years 8141 old, 1121 then thy estimation 6187 shall be of the male 2145 five 2568 shekels 8255 of silver, 3701 and for the female 5347 thy estimation 6187 [shall be] three 7969 shekels 8255 of silver. 3701

27:7 And if [it be] from sixty 8346 years 8141 old 1121 and above; 4605 if [it be] a male, 2145 then thy estimation 6187 shall be fifteen 2568 6240 shekels, 8255 and for the female 5347 ten 6235 shekels. 8255

27:8 But if he be poorer 4134-6 than thy estimation, 6187 then he shall present 5975-52 himself before 6440 the priest, 3548 and the priest 3548 shall value 6186-52 him; according 6310 to his ability 3027 5381-55 that vowed 5087-6 shall the priest 3548 value 6186-55 him.

27:9 And if [it be] a beast, 929 whereof men bring 7126-55 an offering 7133 unto the LORD, 3068 all that [any man] giveth 5414-4 of such unto the LORD 3068 shall be holy. 6944

27:10 He shall not alter 2498-55 it, nor change 4171-55 it, a good 2896 for a bad, 7451 or a bad 7451 for a good: 2896 and if he shall at all 4171-53 change 4171-55 beast 929 for beast, 929 then it and the exchange 8545 thereof shall be holy. 6944

27:11 And if [it be] any unclean 2931 beast, 929 of which they do not offer 7126-55 a sacrifice 7133 unto the LORD, 3068 then he shall present 5975-52 the beast 929 before 6440 the priest: 3548

27:12 And the priest 3548 shall value 6186-52 it, whether 996 it be good 2896 or 996 bad: 7451 as thou valuest 6187 it, [who art] the priest, 3548 so shall it be.

27:13 But if he will at all 1350-2 redeem 1350-4 it, then he shall add 3254-1 a fifth 2549 [part] thereof unto thy estimation. 6187

27:14 And when a man 376 shall sanctify 6942-55 his house 1004 [to be] holy 6944 unto the LORD, 3068 then the priest 3548 shall estimate 6186-52 it, whether it be good 2896 or bad: 7451 as the priest 3548 shall estimate 6186-55 it, so shall it stand. 6965-4

27:15 And if he that sanctified 6942-56 it will redeem 1350-4 his house, 1004 then he shall add 3254-1 the fifth 2549 [part] of the money 3701 of thy estimation 6187 unto it, and it shall be his.

27:16 And if a man 376 shall sanctify 6942-55 unto the LORD 3068 [some part] of a field 7704 of his possession, 272 then thy estimation 6187 shall be according 6310 to the seed 2233 thereof: an homer 2563 of barley 8184 seed 2233 [shall be valued] at fifty 2572 shekels 8255 of silver. 3701

27:17 If he sanctify 6942-55 his field 7704 from the year 8141 of jubile, 3104 according to thy estimation 6187 it shall stand. 6965-4

27:18 But if he sanctify 6942-55 his field 7704 after 310 the jubile, 3104 then the priest 3548 shall reckon 2803-14 unto him the money 3701 according 6310 to the years 8141 that remain, 3498-12 even unto the year 8141 of the jubile, 3104 and it shall be abated 1639-8 from thy estimation. 6187

27:19 And if he that sanctified 6942-56 the field 7704 will in any wise 1350-2 redeem 1350-4 it, then he shall add 3254-1 the fifth 2549 [part] of the money 3701 of thy estimation 6187 unto it, and it shall be assured 6965-1 to him.

27:20 And if he will not redeem 1350-4 the field, 7704 or if he have sold 4376-1 the field 7704 to another 312 man, 376 it shall not be redeemed 1350-11 any more.

27:21 But the field, 7704 when it goeth out 3318-2 in the jubile, 3104 shall be holy 6944 unto the LORD, 3068 as a field 7704 devoted; 2764 the possession 272 thereof shall be the priest's. 3548

27:22 And if [a man] sanctify 6942-55 unto the LORD 3068 a field 7704 which he hath bought, 4736 which [is] not of the fields 7704 of his possession; 272

27:23 Then the priest 3548 shall reckon 2803-14 unto him the worth 4373 of thy estimation, 6187 [even] unto the year 8141 of the jubile: 3104 and he shall give 5414-1 thine estimation 6187 in that day, 3117 [as] a holy 6944 thing unto the LORD. 3068

27:24 In the year 8141 of the jubile 3104 the field 7704 shall return 7725-4 unto him of whom it was bought, 7069-1 [even] to him to whom the possession 272 of the land 776 [did belong].

27:25 And all thy estimations 6187 shall be according to the shekel 8255 of the sanctuary: 6944 twenty 6242 gerahs 1626 shall be the shekel. 8255

27:26 Only the firstling 1060 of the beasts, 929 which should be the LORD'S 3068 firstling, 1069-29 no man 376 shall sanctify 6942-55 it; whether [it be] ox, 7794 or sheep: 7716 it [is] the LORD'S. 3068

27:27 And if [it be] of an unclean 2931 beast, 929 then he shall redeem 6299-1 [it] according to thine estimation, 6187 and shall add 3254-1 a fifth 2549 [part] of it thereto: or if it be not redeemed, 1350-11 then it shall be sold 4376-8 according to thy estimation. 6187

27:28 Notwithstanding no devoted thing, 2764 that a man 376 shall devote 2763-55 unto the LORD 3068 of all that he hath, [both] of man 120 and beast, 929 and of the field 7704 of his possession, 272 shall be sold 4376-11 or redeemed: 1350-11 every devoted thing 2764 [is] most 6944 holy 6944 unto the LORD. 3068

27:29 None 3808 devoted, 2764 which shall be devoted 2763-93 of men, 120 shall be redeemed; 6299-11 [but] shall surely 4191-2 be put to death. 4191-93

27:30 And all the tithe 4643 of the land, 776 [whether] of the seed 2233 of the land, 776 [or] of the fruit 6529 of the tree, 6086 [is] the LORD'S: 3068 [it is] holy 6944 unto the LORD. 3068

27:31 And if a man 376 will at all 1350-2 redeem 1350-4 [ought] of his tithes, 4643 he shall add 3254-55 thereto the fifth 2549 [part] thereof.

27:32 And concerning the tithe 4643 of the herd, 1241 or of the flock, 6629 [even] of whatsoever passeth 5674-4 under the rod, 7626 the tenth 6224 shall be holy 6944 unto the LORD. 3068

27:33 He shall not search 1239-17 whether it be good 2896 or bad, 7451 neither shall he change 4171-55 it: and if he change 4171-55 it at all, 4171-53 then both it and the change 8545 thereof shall be holy; 6944 it shall not be redeemed. 1350-11

27:34 These [are] the commandments, 4687 which the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses 4872 for the children 1121 of Israel 3478 in mount 2022 Sinai. 5514
