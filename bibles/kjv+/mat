1:11 And 1161 Josias 2502 begat 1080 5656 Jechonias 2423 and 2532 his 846 brethren 80, about the time 1909 they were carried away 3350 to Babylon 897: 

1:12 And 1161 after 3326 they were brought 3350 to Babylon 897, Jechonias 2423 begat 1080 5656 Salathiel 4528; and 1161 Salathiel 4528 begat 1080 5656 Zorobabel 2216;

1:16 And 1161 Jacob 2384 begat 1080 5656 Joseph 2501 the husband 435 of Mary 3137, of 1537 whom 3739 was born 1080 5681 Jesus 2424, who 3588 is called 3004 5746 Christ 5547. 

1:17 So 3767 all 3956 the generations 1074 from 575 Abraham 11 to 2193 David 1138 [are] fourteen 1180 generations 1074; and 2532 from 575 David 1138 until 2193 the carrying away 3350 into Babylon 897 [are] fourteen 1180 generations 1074; and 2532 from 575 the carrying away 3350 into Babylon 897 unto 2193 Christ 5547 [are] fourteen 1180 generations 1074. 

1:18 Now 1161 the birth 1083 of Jesus 2424 Christ 5547 was 2258 5713 on this wise 3779: When as 1063 his 846 mother 3384 Mary 3137 was espoused 3423 5685 to Joseph 2501, before 4250 2228 they 846 came together 4905 5629, she was found 2147 5681 with child 1722 1064 2192 5723 of 1537 the Holy 40 Ghost 4151. 

1:19 Then 1161 Joseph 2501 her 846 husband 435, being 5607 5752 a just 1342 [man], and 2532 not 3361 willing 2309 5723 to make 3856 0 her 846 a publick example 3856 5658, was minded 1014 5675 to put 630 0 her 846 away 630 5658 privily 2977. 

1:20 But 1161 while he 846 thought on 1760 5679 these things 5023, behold 2400 5628, the angel 32 of the Lord 2962 appeared 5316 5648 unto him 846 in 2596 a dream 3677, saying 3004 5723, Joseph 2501, thou son 5207 of David 1138, fear 5399 5680 not 3361 to take 3880 5629 unto thee 4675 Mary 3137 thy wife 1135: for 1063 that which is conceived 1080 5685 in 1722 her 846 is 2076 5748 of 1537 the Holy 40 Ghost 4151. 

1:21 And 1161 she shall bring forth 5088 5695 a son 5207, and 2532 thou shalt call 2564 5692 his 846 name 3686 JESUS 2424: for 1063 he shall save 4982 5692 his 848 people 2992 from 575 their 846 sins 266. 

1:22 Now 1161 all 3650 this 5124 was done 1096 5754, that 2443 it might be fulfilled 4137 5686 which 3588 was spoken 4483 5685 of 5259 the Lord 2962 by 1223 the prophet 4396, saying 3004 5723, 

1:23 Behold 2400 5628, a virgin 3933 shall be with child 1722 1064 2192 5692, and 2532 shall bring forth 5088 5695 a son 5207, and 2532 they shall call 2564 5692 his 846 name 3686 Emmanuel 1694, which 3739 being interpreted 3177 5746 is 2076 5748, God 2316 with 3326 us 2257. 

1:24 Then 1161 Joseph 2501 being raised 1326 5685 from 575 sleep 5258 did 4160 5656 as 5613 the angel 32 of the Lord 2962 had bidden 4367 5656 him 846, and 2532 took 3880 5627 unto him 848 his wife 1135: 

1:25 And 2532 knew 1097 5707 her 846 not 3756 till 2193 3739 she had brought forth 5088 5627 her 848 firstborn 4416 son 5207: and 2532 he called 2564 5656 his 846 name 3686 JESUS 2424. 

2:1 Now 1161 when Jesus 2424 was born 1080 5685 in 1722 Bethlehem 965 of Judaea 2449 in 1722 the days 2250 of Herod 2264 the king 935, behold 2400 5628, there came 3854 5633 wise men 3097 from 575 the east 395 to 1519 Jerusalem 2414, 

2:2 Saying 3004 5723, Where 4226 is 2076 5748 he that is born 5088 5685 King 935 of the Jews 2453? for 1063 we have seen 1492 5627 his 846 star 792 in 1722 the east 395, and 2532 are come 2064 5627 to worship 4352 5658 him 846. 

2:3 When 1161 Herod 2264 the king 935 had heard 191 5660 [these things], he was troubled 5015 5681, and 2532 all 3956 Jerusalem 2414 with 3326 him 846. 

2:4 And 2532 when he had gathered 4863 0 all 3956 the chief priests 749 and 2532 scribes 1122 of the people 2992 together 4863 5631, he demanded 4441 5711 of 3844 them 846 where 4226 Christ 5547 should be born 1080 5743. 

2:5 And 1161 they said 2036 5627 unto him 846, In 1722 Bethlehem 965 of Judaea 2449: for 1063 thus 3779 it is written 1125 5769 by 1223 the prophet 4396, 

2:6 And 2532 thou 4771 Bethlehem 965, [in] the land 1093 of Juda 2455, art 1488 5748 not 3760 the least 1646 among 1722 the princes 2232 of Juda 2455: for 1063 out of 1537 thee 4675 shall come 1831 5695 a Governor 2233 5740, that 3748 shall rule 4165 5692 my 3450 people 2992 Israel 2474. 

2:7 Then 5119 Herod 2264, when he had privily 2977 called 2564 5660 the wise men 3097, enquired 198 0 of 3844 them 846 diligently 198 5656 what time 5550 the star 792 appeared 5316 5730. 

2:8 And 2532 he sent 3992 5660 them 846 to 1519 Bethlehem 965, and said 2036 5627, Go 4198 5679 and search 1833 5657 diligently 199 for 4012 the young child 3813; and 1161 when 1875 ye have found 2147 5632 [him], bring 518 0 me 3427 word again 518 5657, that 3704 I may come 2064 5631 and worship 4352 5661 him 846 also 2504. 

2:9 When 1161 they had heard 191 5660 the king 935, they departed 4198 5675; and 2532, lo 2400 5628, the star 792, which 3739 they saw 1492 5627 in 1722 the east 395, went before 4254 5707 them 846, till 2193 it came 2064 5631 and stood 2476 5627 over 1883 where 3757 the young child 3813 was 2258 5713. 

2:10 When 1161 they saw 1492 5631 the star 792, they rejoiced 5463 5644 with exceeding 4970 great 3173 joy 5479. 

2:11 And 2532 when they were come 2064 5631 into 1519 the house 3614, they saw 2147 5627 5625 1492 5627 the young child 3813 with 3326 Mary 3137 his 846 mother 3384, and 2532 fell down 4098 5631, and worshipped 4352 5656 him 846: and 2532 when they had opened 455 5660 their 848 treasures 2344, they presented 4374 5656 unto him 846 gifts 1435; gold 5557, and 2532 frankincense 3030, and 2532 myrrh 4666. 

2:12 And 2532 being warned of God 5537 5685 in 2596 a dream 3677 that they should 344 0 not 3361 return 344 5658 to 4314 Herod 2264, they departed 402 5656 into 1519 their own 848 country 5561 another 1223 243 way 3598. 

2:13 And 1161 when they 846 were departed 402 5660, behold 2400 5628, the angel 32 of the Lord 2962 appeareth 5316 5727 to Joseph 2501 in 2596 a dream 3677, saying 3004 5723, Arise 1453 5685, and take 3880 5628 the young child 3813 and 2532 his 846 mother 3384, and 2532 flee 5343 5720 into 1519 Egypt 125, and 2532 be thou 2468 5749 there 1563 until 2193 I 302 bring 2036 0 thee 4671 word 2036 5632: for 1063 Herod 2264 will 3195 5719 seek 2212 5721 the young child 3813 to destroy 622 5658 him 846. 

2:14 When 1161 he arose 1453 5685, he took 3880 5627 the young child 3813 and 2532 his 846 mother 3384 by night 3571, and 2532 departed 402 5656 into 1519 Egypt 125: 

2:15 And 2532 was 2258 5713 there 1563 until 2193 the death 5054 of Herod 2264: that 2443 it might be fulfilled 4137 5686 which 3588 was spoken 4483 5685 of 5259 the Lord 2962 by 1223 the prophet 4396, saying 3004 5723, Out of 1537 Egypt 125 have I called 2564 5656 my 3450 son 5207. 

2:16 Then 5119 Herod 2264, when he saw 1492 5631 that 3754 he was mocked 1702 5681 of 5259 the wise men 3097, was exceeding 3029 wroth 2373 5681, and 2532 sent forth 649 5660, and slew 337 5627 all 3956 the children 3816 that were in 1722 Bethlehem 965, and 2532 in 1722 all 3956 the coasts 3725 thereof 846, from 575 two years old 1332 and 2532 under 2736, according 2596 to the time 5550 which 3739 he had diligently enquired 198 5656 of 3844 the wise men 3097. 

2:17 Then 5119 was fulfilled 4137 5681 that which 3588 was spoken 4483 5685 by 5259 Jeremy 2408 the prophet 4396, saying 3004 5723, 

2:18 In 1722 Rama 4471 was there 191 0 a voice 5456 heard 191 5681, lamentation 2355, and 2532 weeping 2805, and 2532 great 4183 mourning 3602, Rachel 4478 weeping 2799 5723 [for] her 848 children 5043, and 2532 would 2309 5707 not 3756 be comforted 3870 5683, because 3754 they are 1526 5748 not 3756. 

2:19 But 1161 when Herod 2264 was dead 5053 5660, behold 2400 5628, an angel 32 of the Lord 2962 appeareth 5316 5727 in 2596 a dream 3677 to Joseph 2501 in 1722 Egypt 125, 

2:20 Saying 3004 5723, Arise 1453 5685, and take 3880 5628 the young child 3813 and 2532 his 846 mother 3384, and 2532 go 4198 5737 into 1519 the land 1093 of Israel 2474: for 1063 they are dead 2348 5758 which 3588 sought 2212 5723 the young child's 3813 life 5590. 

2:21 And 1161 he arose 1453 5685, and took 3880 5627 the young child 3813 and 2532 his 846 mother 3384, and 2532 came 2064 5627 into 1519 the land 1093 of Israel 2474. 

2:22 But 1161 when he heard 191 5660 that 3754 Archelaus 745 did reign 936 5719 in 1909 Judaea 2449 in the room 473 of his 846 father 3962 Herod 2264, he was afraid 5399 5675 to go 565 5629 thither 1563: notwithstanding 1161, being warned of God 5537 5685 in 2596 a dream 3677, he turned aside 402 5656 into 1519 the parts 3313 of Galilee 1056: 

2:23 And 2532 he came 2064 5631 and dwelt 2730 5656 in 1519 a city 4172 called 3004 5746 Nazareth 3478: that 3704 it might be fulfilled 4137 5686 which 3588 was spoken 4483 5685 by 1223 the prophets 4396, 3754 He shall be called 2564 5701 a Nazarene 3480. 

3:1 1161 In 1722 those 1565 days 2250 came 3854 5736 John 2491 the Baptist 910, preaching 2784 5723 in 1722 the wilderness 2048 of Judaea 2449, 

3:2 And 2532 saying 3004 5723, Repent ye 3340 5720: for 1063 the kingdom 932 of heaven 3772 is at hand 1448 5758. 

3:3 For 1063 this 3778 is he 2076 5748 that was spoken 4483 5685 of by 5259 the prophet 4396 Esaias 2268, saying 3004 5723, The voice 5456 of one crying 994 5723 in 1722 the wilderness 2048, Prepare ye 2090 5657 the way 3598 of the Lord 2962, make 4160 5720 his 846 paths 5147 straight 2117. 

3:4 And 1161 the same 846 John 2491 had 2192 5707 his 848 raiment 1742 of 575 camel's 2574 hair 2359, and 2532 a leathern 1193 girdle 2223 about 4012 his 848 loins 3751; and 1161 his 846 meat 5160 was 2258 5713 locusts 200 and 2532 wild 66 honey 3192. 

3:5 Then 5119 went out 1607 5711 to 4314 him 846 Jerusalem 2414, and 2532 all 3956 Judaea 2449, and 2532 all 3956 the region round about 4066 Jordan 2446, 

3:6 And 2532 were baptized 907 5712 of 5259 him 846 in 1722 Jordan 2446, confessing 1843 5734 their 848 sins 266. 

3:7 But 1161 when he saw 1492 5631 many 4183 of the Pharisees 5330 and 2532 Sadducees 4523 come 2064 5740 to 1909 his 848 baptism 908, he said 2036 5627 unto them 846, O generation 1081 of vipers 2191, who 5101 hath warned 5263 5656 you 5213 to flee 5343 5629 from 575 the wrath 3709 to come 3195 5723? 

3:8 Bring forth 4160 5657 therefore 3767 fruits 2590 meet 514 for repentance 3341: 

3:9 And 2532 think 1380 5661 not 3361 to say 3004 5721 within 1722 yourselves 1438, We have 2192 5719 Abraham 11 to [our] father 3962: for 1063 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, that 3754 God 2316 is able 1410 5736 of 1537 these 5130 stones 3037 to raise up 1453 5658 children 5043 unto Abraham 11. 

3:10 And 1161 now 2235 also 2532 the axe 513 is laid 2749 5736 unto 4314 the root 4491 of the trees 1186: therefore 3767 every 3956 tree 1186 which bringeth 4160 0 not 3361 forth 4160 5723 good 2570 fruit 2590 is hewn down 1581 5743, and 2532 cast 906 5743 into 1519 the fire 4442. 

3:11 I 1473 indeed 3303 baptize 907 5719 you 5209 with 1722 water 5204 unto 1519 repentance 3341: but 1161 he that cometh 2064 5740 after 3694 me 3450 is 2076 5748 mightier than 2478 I 3450, whose 3739 shoes 5266 I am 1510 5748 not 3756 worthy 2425 to bear 941 5658: he shall baptize 907 5692 you 5209 with 1722 the Holy 40 Ghost 4151, and 2532 [with] fire 4442: 

3:12 Whose 3739 fan 4425 [is] in 1722 his 846 hand 5495, and 2532 he will throughly purge 1245 5692 his 848 floor 257, and 2532 gather 4863 5692 his 848 wheat 4621 into 1519 the garner 596; but 1161 he will burn up 2618 5692 the chaff 892 with unquenchable 762 fire 4442. 

3:13 Then 5119 cometh 3854 5736 Jesus 2424 from 575 Galilee 1056 to 1909 Jordan 2446 unto 4314 John 2491, to be baptized 907 5683 of 5259 him 846. 

3:14 But 1161 John 2491 forbad 1254 5707 him, saying 3004 5723, I 1473 have 2192 5719 need 5532 to be baptized 907 5683 of 5259 thee 4675, and 2532 comest 2064 5736 thou 4771 to 4314 me 3165? 

3:15 And 1161 Jesus 2424 answering 611 5679 said 2036 5627 unto 4314 him 846, Suffer 863 5628 [it to be so] now 737: for 1063 thus 3779 it becometh 4241 5723 2076 5748 us 2254 to fulfil 4137 5658 all 3956 righteousness 1343. Then 5119 he suffered 863 5719 him 846. 

3:16 And 2532 Jesus 2424, when he was baptized 907 5685, went up 305 5627 straightway 2117 out of 575 the water 5204: and 2532, lo 2400 5628, the heavens 3772 were opened 455 5681 unto him 846, and 2532 he saw 1492 5627 the Spirit 4151 of God 2316 descending 2597 5723 like 5616 a dove 4058, and 2532 lighting 2064 5740 upon 1909 him 846: 

3:17 And 2532 lo 2400 5628 a voice 5456 from 1537 heaven 3772, saying 3004 5723, This 3778 is 2076 5748 my 3450 beloved 27 Son 5207, in 1722 whom 3739 I am well pleased 2106 5656. 

4:1 Then 5119 was Jesus 2424 led up 321 5681 of 5259 the Spirit 4151 into 1519 the wilderness 2048 to be tempted 3985 5683 of 5259 the devil 1228. 

4:2 And 2532 when he had fasted 3522 5660 forty 5062 days 2250 and 2532 forty 5062 nights 3571, he was afterward 5305 an hungred 3983 5656. 

4:3 And 2532 when the tempter 3985 5723 came 4334 5631 to him 846, he said 2036 5627, If 1487 thou be 1488 5748 the Son 5207 of God 2316, command 2036 5628 that 2443 these 3778 stones 3037 be made 1096 5638 bread 740. 

4:4 But 1161 he answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627, It is written 1125 5769, Man 444 shall 2198 0 not 3756 live 2198 5695 by 1909 bread 740 alone 3441, but 235 by 1909 every 3956 word 4487 that proceedeth 1607 5740 out of 1223 the mouth 4750 of God 2316. 

4:5 Then 5119 the devil 1228 taketh 3880 0 him 846 up 3880 5719 into 1519 the holy 40 city 4172, and 2532 setteth 2476 5719 him 846 on 1909 a pinnacle 4419 of the temple 2411, 

4:6 And 2532 saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, If 1487 thou be 1488 5748 the Son 5207 of God 2316, cast 906 5628 thyself 4572 down 2736: for 1063 it is written 1125 5769, 3754 He shall give 1781 0 his 848 angels 32 charge 1781 5699 concerning 4012 thee 4675: and 2532 in 1909 [their] hands 5495 they shall bear 142 0 thee 4571 up 142 5692, lest at any time 3379 thou dash 4350 5661 thy 4675 foot 4228 against 4314 a stone 3037. 

4:7 Jesus 2424 said 5346 5713 unto him 846, It is written 1125 5769 again 3825, Thou shalt 1598 0 not 3756 tempt 1598 5692 the Lord 2962 thy 4675 God 2316. 

4:8 Again 3825, the devil 1228 taketh 3880 0 him 846 up 3880 5719 into 1519 an exceeding 3029 high 5308 mountain 3735, and 2532 sheweth 1166 5719 him 846 all 3956 the kingdoms 932 of the world 2889, and 2532 the glory 1391 of them 846; 

4:9 And 2532 saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, All 3956 these things 5023 will I give 1325 5692 thee 4671, if 1437 thou wilt fall down 4098 5631 and worship 4352 5661 me 3427. 

4:10 Then 5119 saith 3004 5719 Jesus 2424 unto him 846, Get thee hence 5217 5720, Satan 4567: for 1063 it is written 1125 5769, Thou shalt worship 4352 5692 the Lord 2962 thy 4675 God 2316, and 2532 him 846 only 3441 shalt thou serve 3000 5692. 

4:11 Then 5119 the devil 1228 leaveth 863 5719 him 846, and 2532, behold 2400 5628, angels 32 came 4334 5656 and 2532 ministered 1247 5707 unto him 846. 

4:12 Now 1161 when Jesus 2424 had heard 191 5660 that 3754 John 2491 was cast into prison 3860 5681, he departed 402 5656 into 1519 Galilee 1056; 

4:13 And 2532 leaving 2641 5631 Nazareth 3478, he came 2064 5631 and dwelt 2730 5656 in 1519 Capernaum 2584, which 3588 is upon the sea coast 3864, in 1722 the borders 3725 of Zabulon 2194 and 2532 Nephthalim 3508: 

4:14 That 2443 it might be fulfilled 4137 5686 which 3588 was spoken 4483 5685 by 1223 Esaias 2268 the prophet 4396, saying 3004 5723, 

4:15 The land 1093 of Zabulon 2194, and 2532 the land 1093 of Nephthalim 3508, [by] the way 3598 of the sea 2281, beyond 4008 Jordan 2446, Galilee 1056 of the Gentiles 1484; 

4:16 The people 2992 which 3588 sat 2521 5740 in 1722 darkness 4655 saw 1492 5627 great 3173 light 5457; and 2532 to them which 3588 sat 2521 5740 in 1722 the region 5561 and 2532 shadow 4639 of death 2288 light 5457 is sprung up 393 5656 846. 

4:17 From 575 that time 5119 Jesus 2424 began 756 5662 to preach 2784 5721, and 2532 to say 3004 5721, Repent 3340 5720: for 1063 the kingdom 932 of heaven 3772 is at hand 1448 5758. 

4:18 And 1161 Jesus 2424, walking 4043 5723 by 3844 the sea 2281 of Galilee 1056, saw 1492 5627 two 1417 brethren 80, Simon 4613 called 3004 5746 Peter 4074, and 2532 Andrew 406 his 846 brother 80, casting 906 5723 a net 293 into 1519 the sea 2281: for 1063 they were 2258 5713 fishers 231. 

4:19 And 2532 he saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Follow 1205 5773 3694 me 3450, and 2532 I will make 4160 5692 you 5209 fishers 231 of men 444. 

4:20 And 1161 they straightway 2112 left 863 5631 [their] nets 1350, and 2532 followed 190 5656 him 846. 

4:21 And 2532 going on 4260 5631 from thence 1564, he saw 1492 5627 other 243 two 1417 brethren 80, James 2385 [the son] of 3588 Zebedee 2199, and 2532 John 2491 his 846 brother 80, in 1722 a ship 4143 with 3326 Zebedee 2199 their 848 father 3962, mending 2675 5723 their 846 nets 1350; and 2532 he called 2564 5656 them 846. 

4:22 And 1161 they immediately 2112 left 863 5631 the ship 4143 and 2532 their 848 father 3962, and followed 190 5656 him 846. 

4:23 And 2532 Jesus 2424 went about 4013 5707 all 3650 Galilee 1056, teaching 1321 5723 in 1722 their 846 synagogues 4864, and 2532 preaching 2784 5723 the gospel 2098 of the kingdom 932, and 2532 healing 2323 5723 all 3956 manner of sickness 3554 and 2532 all 3956 manner of disease 3119 among 1722 the people 2992. 

4:24 And 2532 his 846 fame 189 went 565 5627 throughout 1519 all 3650 Syria 4947: and 2532 they brought 4374 5656 unto him 846 all 3956 sick 2560 people 2192 5723 that were taken with 4912 5746 divers 4164 diseases 3554 and 2532 torments 931, and 2532 those which were possessed with devils 1139 5740, and 2532 those which were lunatick 4583 5740, and 2532 those that had the palsy 3885; and 2532 he healed 2323 5656 them 846. 

4:25 And 2532 there followed 190 5656 him 846 great 4183 multitudes of people 3793 from 575 Galilee 1056, and 2532 [from] Decapolis 1179, and 2532 [from] Jerusalem 2414, and 2532 [from] Judaea 2449, and 2532 [from] beyond 4008 Jordan 2446. 

5:1 And 1161 seeing 1492 5631 the multitudes 3793, he went up 305 5627 into 1519 a mountain 3735: and 2532 when he was set 2523 5660, his 846 disciples 3101 came 4334 5656 unto him 846: 

5:2 And 2532 he opened 455 5660 his 848 mouth 4750, and taught 1321 5707 them 846, saying 3004 5723, 

5:3 Blessed 3107 [are] the poor 4434 in spirit 4151: for 3754 theirs 846 is 2076 5748 the kingdom 932 of heaven 3772. 

5:4 Blessed 3107 [are] they that mourn 3996 5723: for 3754 they 846 shall be comforted 3870 5701. 

5:5 Blessed 3107 [are] the meek 4239: for 3754 they 846 shall inherit 2816 5692 the earth 1093. 

5:6 Blessed 3107 [are] they which 3588 do hunger 3983 5723 and 2532 thirst 1372 5723 after righteousness 1343: for 3754 they 846 shall be filled 5526 5701. 

5:7 Blessed 3107 [are] the merciful 1655: for 3754 they 846 shall obtain mercy 1653 5701. 

5:8 Blessed 3107 [are] the pure 2513 in heart 2588: for 3754 they 846 shall see 3700 5695 God 2316. 

5:9 Blessed 3107 [are] the peacemakers 1518: for 3754 they 846 shall be called 2564 5701 the children 5207 of God 2316. 

5:10 Blessed 3107 [are] they which are persecuted 1377 5772 for 1752 righteousness' sake 1343: for 3754 theirs 846 is 2076 5748 the kingdom 932 of heaven 3772. 

5:11 Blessed 3107 are ye 2075 5748, when 3752 [men] shall revile 3679 5661 you 5209, and 2532 persecute 1377 5661 [you], and 2532 shall say 2036 5632 all manner 3956 of evil 4190 4487 against 2596 you 5216 falsely 5574 5730, for my sake 1752 1700. 

5:12 Rejoice 5463 5720, and 2532 be exceeding glad 21 5737: for 3754 great 4183 [is] your 5216 reward 3408 in 1722 heaven 3772: for 1063 so 3779 persecuted they 1377 5656 the prophets 4396 which 3588 were before 4253 you 5216. 

5:13 Ye 5210 are 2075 5748 the salt 217 of the earth 1093: but 1161 if 1437 the salt 217 have lost his savour 3471 5686, wherewith 1722 5101 shall it be salted 233 5701? it is thenceforth 2089 good 2480 5719 for 1519 nothing 3762, but 1508 to be cast 906 5683 out 1854, and 2532 to be trodden under foot 2662 5745 of 5259 men 444. 

5:14 Ye 5210 are 2075 5748 the light 5457 of the world 2889. A city 4172 that is set 2749 5740 on 1883 an hill 3735 cannot 3756 1410 5736 be hid 2928 5650. 

5:15 Neither 3761 do men light 2545 5719 a candle 3088, and 2532 put 5087 5719 it 846 under 5259 a bushel 3426, but 235 on 1909 a candlestick 3087; and 2532 it giveth light 2989 5719 unto all 3956 that are in 1722 the house 3614. 

5:16 Let your 5216 light 5457 so 3779 shine 2989 5657 before 1715 men 444, that 3704 they may see 1492 5632 your 5216 good 2570 works 2041, and 2532 glorify 1392 5661 your 5216 Father 3962 which 3588 is in 1722 heaven 3772. 

5:17 Think 3543 5661 not 3361 that 3754 I am come 2064 5627 to destroy 2647 5658 the law 3551, or 2228 the prophets 4396: I am 2064 0 not 3756 come 2064 5627 to destroy 2647 5658, but 235 to fulfil 4137 5658. 

5:18 For 1063 verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, Till 2193 302 heaven 3772 and 2532 earth 1093 pass 3928 5632, one 1520 jot 2503 or 2228 one 3391 tittle 2762 shall in no wise 3364 pass 3928 5632 from 575 the law 3551, till 2193 302 all 3956 be fulfilled 1096 5638. 

5:19 Whosoever 3739 1437 therefore 3767 shall break 3089 5661 one 3391 of these 5130 least 1646 commandments 1785, and 2532 shall teach 1321 5661 men 444 so 3779, he shall be called 2564 5701 the least 1646 in 1722 the kingdom 932 of heaven 3772: but 1161 whosoever 3739 302 shall do 4160 5661 and 2532 teach 1321 5661 [them], the same 3778 shall be called 2564 5701 great 3173 in 1722 the kingdom 932 of heaven 3772. 

5:20 For 1063 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, That 3754 except 3362 your 5216 righteousness 1343 shall exceed 4052 5661 4119 [the righteousness] of the scribes 1122 and 2532 Pharisees 5330, ye shall in no case 3364 enter 1525 5632 into 1519 the kingdom 932 of heaven 3772. 

5:21 Ye have heard 191 5656 that 3754 it was said 4483 5681 by them of old time 744, Thou shalt 5407 0 not 3756 kill 5407 5692; and 1161 whosoever 3739 302 shall kill 5407 5661 shall be 2071 5704 in danger 1777 of the judgment 2920: 

5:22 But 1161 I 1473 say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, That 3754 whosoever 3956 is angry 3710 5746 with his 848 brother 80 without a cause 1500 shall be 2071 5704 in danger 1777 of the judgment 2920: and 1161 whosoever 3739 302 shall say 2036 5632 to his 848 brother 80, Raca 4469, shall be 2071 5704 in danger 1777 of the council 4892: but 1161 whosoever 3739 302 shall say 2036 5632, Thou fool 3474, shall be 2071 5704 in danger 1777 of 1519 hell 1067 fire 4442. 

5:23 Therefore 3767 if 1437 thou bring 4374 5725 thy 4675 gift 1435 to 1909 the altar 2379, and there 2546 rememberest 3415 5686 that 3754 thy 4675 brother 80 hath 2192 5719 ought 5100 against 2596 thee 4675; 

5:24 Leave 863 5628 there 1563 thy 4675 gift 1435 before 1715 the altar 2379, and 2532 go thy way 5217 5720; first 4412 be reconciled 1259 5649 to thy 4675 brother 80, and 2532 then 5119 come 2064 5631 and offer 4374 5720 thy 4675 gift 1435. 

5:25 Agree 2468 5749 2132 5723 with thine 4675 adversary 476 quickly 5035, whiles 2193 3755 thou art 1488 5748 in 1722 the way 3598 with 3326 him 846; lest at any time 3379 the adversary 476 deliver 3860 5632 thee 4571 to the judge 2923, and 2532 the judge 2923 deliver 3860 5632 thee 4571 to the officer 5257, and 2532 thou be cast 906 5701 into 1519 prison 5438. 

5:26 Verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto thee 4671, Thou shalt 1831 0 by no means 3364 come 1831 5632 out thence 1564, till 2193 302 thou hast paid 591 5632 the uttermost 2078 farthing 2835. 

5:27 Ye have heard 191 5656 that 3754 it was said 4483 5681 by them of old time 744, Thou shalt 3431 0 not 3756 commit adultery 3431 5692: 

5:28 But 1161 I 1473 say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, That 3754 whosoever 3956 looketh 991 5723 on a woman 1135 to 4314 lust after 1937 5658 her 846 hath committed adultery 3431 5656 with her 846 already 2235 in 1722 his 848 heart 2588. 

5:29 And 1161 if 1487 thy 4675 right 1188 eye 3788 offend 4624 5719 thee 4571, pluck 1807 0 it 846 out 1807 5628, and 2532 cast 906 5628 [it] from 575 thee 4675: for 1063 it is profitable 4851 5719 for thee 4671 that 2443 one 1520 of thy 4675 members 3196 should perish 622 5643, and 2532 not 3361 [that] thy 4675 whole 3650 body 4983 should be cast 906 5686 into 1519 hell 1067. 

5:30 And 2532 if 1487 thy 4675 right 1188 hand 5495 offend 4624 5719 thee 4571, cut 1581 0 it 846 off 1581 5657, and 2532 cast 906 5628 [it] from 575 thee 4675: for 1063 it is profitable 4851 5719 for thee 4671 that 2443 one 1520 of thy 4675 members 3196 should perish 622 5643, and 2532 not 3361 [that] thy 4675 whole 3650 body 4983 should be cast 906 5686 into 1519 hell 1067. 

5:31 1161 It hath been said 4483 5681 3754, Whosoever 3739 302 shall put away 630 5661 his 848 wife 1135, let him give 1325 5628 her 846 a writing of divorcement 647: 

5:32 But 1161 I 1473 say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, That 3754 whosoever 302 shall put away 630 5661 his 848 wife 1135, saving 3924 for the cause 3056 of fornication 4202, causeth 4160 5719 her 846 to commit adultery 3429 5738: and 2532 whosoever 3739 1437 shall marry 1060 5661 her that is divorced 630 5772 committeth adultery 3429 5736. 

5:33 Again 3825, ye have heard 191 5656 that 3754 it hath been said 4483 5681 by them of old time 744, Thou shalt 1964 0 not 3756 forswear thyself 1964 5692, but 1161 shalt perform 591 5692 unto the Lord 2962 thine 4675 oaths 3727: 

5:34 But 1161 I 1473 say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, Swear 3660 5658 not 3361 at all 3654; neither 3383 by 1722 heaven 3772; for 3754 it is 2076 5748 God's 2316 throne 2362: 

5:35 Nor 3383 by 1722 the earth 1093; for 3754 it is 2076 5748 his 846 footstool 4228 5286: neither 3383 by 1519 Jerusalem 2414; for 3754 it is 2076 5748 the city 4172 of the great 3173 King 935. 

5:36 Neither 3383 shalt thou swear 3660 5661 by 1722 thy 4675 head 2776, because 3754 thou canst 1410 5736 not 3756 make 4160 5658 one 3391 hair 2359 white 3022 or 2228 black 3189. 

5:37 But 1161 let 2077 0 your 5216 communication 3056 be 2077 5749, Yea 3483, yea 3483; Nay 3756, nay 3756: for 1161 whatsoever is more 4053 than these 5130 cometh 2076 5748 of 1537 evil 4190. 

5:38 Ye have heard 191 5656 that 3754 it hath been said 4483 5681, An eye 3788 for 473 an eye 3788, and 2532 a tooth 3599 for 473 a tooth 3599: 

5:39 But 1161 I 1473 say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, That ye resist 436 5629 not 3361 evil 4190: but 235 whosoever 3748 shall smite 4474 5692 thee 4571 on 1909 thy 4675 right 1188 cheek 4600, turn 4762 5657 to him 846 the other 243 also 2532. 

5:40 And 2532 if any man will 2309 5723 sue 2919 0 thee 4671 at the law 2919 5683, and 2532 take away 2983 5629 thy 4675 coat 5509, let 863 0 him 846 have 863 5628 [thy] cloke 2440 also 2532. 

5:41 And 2532 whosoever 3748 shall compel 29 0 thee 4571 to go 29 5692 a 1520 mile 3400, go 5217 5720 with 3326 him 846 twain 1417. 

5:42 Give 1325 5720 to him that asketh 154 5723 thee 4571, and 2532 from him that would 2309 5723 borrow 1155 5670 of 575 thee 4675 turn 654 0 not 3361 thou away 654 5652. 

5:43 Ye have heard 191 5656 that 3754 it hath been said 4483 5681, Thou shalt love 25 5692 thy 4675 neighbour 4139, and 2532 hate 3404 5692 thine 4675 enemy 2190. 

5:44 But 1161 I 1473 say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, Love 25 5720 your 5216 enemies 2190, bless 2127 5720 them that curse 2672 5740 you 5209, do 4160 5720 good 2573 to them that hate 3404 5723 you 5209, and 2532 pray 4336 5737 for 5228 them which 3588 despitefully use 1908 5723 you 5209, and 2532 persecute 1377 5723 you 5209; 

5:45 That 3704 ye may be 1096 5638 the children 5207 of your 5216 Father 3962 which 3588 is in 1722 heaven 3772: for 3754 he maketh 393 0 his 848 sun 2246 to rise 393 5719 on 1909 the evil 4190 and 2532 on the good 18, and 2532 sendeth rain 1026 5719 on 1909 the just 1342 and 2532 on the unjust 94. 

5:46 For 1063 if 1437 ye love 25 5661 them which 3588 love 25 5723 you 5209, what 5101 reward 3408 have ye 2192 5719? do 4160 5719 not 3780 even 2532 the publicans 5057 the same 846? 

5:47 And 2532 if 1437 ye salute 782 5667 your 5216 brethren 80 only 3440, what 5101 do 4160 5719 ye more 4053 [than others]? do 4160 5719 not 3780 even 2532 the publicans 5057 so 3779? 

5:48 Be 2071 5704 ye 5210 therefore 3767 perfect 5046, even 5618 as your 5216 Father 3962 which 3588 is in 1722 heaven 3772 is 2076 5748 perfect 5046. 

6:1 Take heed 4337 5720 that ye do 4160 5721 not 3361 your 5216 alms 1654 before 1715 men 444, to be seen 4314 2300 5683 of them 846: otherwise 1490 ye have 2192 5719 no 3756 reward 3408 of 3844 your 5216 Father 3962 which 3588 is in 1722 heaven 3772. 

6:2 Therefore 3767 when 3752 thou doest 4160 5725 [thine] alms 1654, do 4537 0 not 3361 sound a trumpet 4537 5661 before 1715 thee 4675, as 5618 the hypocrites 5273 do 4160 5719 in 1722 the synagogues 4864 and 2532 in 1722 the streets 4505, that 3704 they may have glory 1392 5686 of 5259 men 444. Verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, They have 568 5719 their 848 reward 3408. 

6:3 But 1161 when thou 4675 doest 4160 5723 alms 1654, let 1097 0 not 3361 thy 4675 left hand 710 know 1097 5628 what 5101 thy 4675 right hand 1188 doeth 4160 5719: 

6:4 That 3704 thine 4675 alms 1654 may be 5600 5753 in 1722 secret 2927: and 2532 thy 4675 Father 3962 which 3588 seeth 991 5723 in 1722 secret 2927 himself 846 shall reward 591 5692 thee 4671 openly 1722 5318. 

6:5 And 2532 when 3752 thou prayest 4336 5741, thou shalt 2071 0 not 3756 be 2071 5704 as 5618 the hypocrites 5273 [are]: for 3754 they love 5368 5719 to pray 4336 5738 standing 2476 5761 in 1722 the synagogues 4864 and 2532 in 1722 the corners 1137 of the streets 4113, that 3704 they may 302 be seen 5316 5652 of men 444. Verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, 3754 They have 568 5719 their 848 reward 3408. 

6:6 But 1161 thou 4771, when 3752 thou prayest 4336 5741, enter 1525 5628 into 1519 thy 4675 closet 5009, and 2532 when thou hast shut 2808 5660 thy 4675 door 2374, pray 4336 5663 to thy 4675 Father 3962 which 3588 is in 1722 secret 2927; and 2532 thy 4675 Father 3962 which 3588 seeth 991 5723 in 1722 secret 2927 shall reward 591 5692 thee 4671 openly 1722 5318. 

6:7 But 1161 when ye pray 4336 5740, use 945 0 not 3361 vain repetitions 945 5661, as 5618 the heathen 1482 [do]: for 1063 they think 1380 5719 that 3754 they shall be heard 1522 5701 for 1722 their 846 much speaking 4180. 

6:8 Be 3666 0 not 3361 ye 3666 0 therefore 3767 like 3666 5686 unto them 846: for 1063 your 5216 Father 3962 knoweth 1492 5758 what things 3739 ye have 2192 5719 need of 5532, before 4253 ye 5209 ask 154 5658 him 846. 

6:9 After this manner 3779 therefore 3767 pray 4336 5737 ye 5210: Our 2257 Father 3962 which 3588 art in 1722 heaven 3772, Hallowed be 37 5682 thy 4675 name 3686. 

6:10 Thy 4675 kingdom 932 come 2064 5628. Thy 4675 will 2307 be done 1096 5676 in 1909 earth 1093, as 2532 5613 [it is] in 1722 heaven 3772. 

6:11 Give 1325 5628 us 2254 this day 4594 our 2257 daily 1967 bread 740. 

6:12 And 2532 forgive 863 5628 us 2254 our 2257 debts 3783, as 2532 5613 we 2249 forgive 863 5719 our 2257 debtors 3781. 

6:13 And 2532 lead 1533 5661 us 2248 not 3361 into 1519 temptation 3986, but 235 deliver 4506 5663 us 2248 from 575 evil 4190: For 3754 thine 4675 is 2076 5748 the kingdom 932, and 2532 the power 1411, and 2532 the glory 1391, for 1519 ever 165. Amen 281. 

6:14 For 1063 if 1437 ye forgive 863 5632 men 444 their 846 trespasses 3900, your 5216 heavenly 3770 Father 3962 will also 2532 forgive 863 5692 you 5213: 

6:15 But 1161 if 3362 0 ye forgive 863 5632 not 3362 men 444 their 846 trespasses 3900, neither 3761 will your 5216 Father 3962 forgive 863 5692 your 5216 trespasses 3900. 

6:16 Moreover 1161 when 3752 ye fast 3522 5725, be 1096 5737 not 3361, as 5618 the hypocrites 5273, of a sad countenance 4659: for 1063 they disfigure 853 5719 their 848 faces 4383, that 3704 they may appear 5316 5652 unto men 444 to fast 3522 5723. Verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, 3754 They have 568 5719 their 848 reward 3408. 

6:17 But 1161 thou 4771, when thou fastest 3522 5723, anoint 218 5669 thine 4675 head 2776, and 2532 wash 3538 5669 thy 4675 face 4383; 

6:18 That 3704 thou appear 5316 5652 not 3361 unto men 444 to fast 3522 5723, but 235 unto thy 4675 Father 3962 which 3588 is in 1722 secret 2927: and 2532 thy 4675 Father 3962, which 3588 seeth 991 5723 in 1722 secret 2927, shall reward 591 5692 thee 4671 openly 1722 5318. 

6:19 Lay 2343 0 not 3361 up 2343 5720 for yourselves 5213 treasures 2344 upon 1909 earth 1093, where 3699 moth 4597 and 2532 rust 1035 doth corrupt 853 5719, and 2532 where 3699 thieves 2812 break through 1358 5719 and 2532 steal 2813 5719: 

6:20 But 1161 lay up 2343 5720 for yourselves 5213 treasures 2344 in 1722 heaven 3772, where 3699 neither 3777 moth 4597 nor 3777 rust 1035 doth corrupt 853 5719, and 2532 where 3699 thieves 2812 do 1358 0 not 3756 break through 1358 5719 nor 3761 steal 2813 5719: 

6:21 For 1063 where 3699 your 5216 treasure 2344 is 2076 5748, there 1563 will 2071 0 your 5216 heart 2588 be 2071 5704 also 2532. 

6:22 The light 3088 of the body 4983 is 2076 5748 the eye 3788: if 1437 therefore 3767 thine 4675 eye 3788 be 5600 5753 single 573, thy 4675 whole 3650 body 4983 shall be 2071 5704 full of light 5460. 

6:23 But 1161 if 1437 thine 4675 eye 3788 be 5600 5753 evil 4190, thy 4675 whole 3650 body 4983 shall be 2071 5704 full of darkness 4652. If 1487 therefore 3767 the light 5457 that is 2076 5748 in 1722 thee 4671 be darkness 4655, how great 4214 [is] that darkness 4655! 

6:24 No man 3762 can 1410 5736 serve 1398 5721 two 1417 masters 2962: for 1063 either 2228 he will hate 3404 5692 the one 1520, and 2532 love 25 5692 the other 2087; or else 2228 he will hold 472 5695 to the one 1520, and 2532 despise 2706 5692 the other 2087. Ye cannot 3756 1410 5736 serve 1398 5721 God 2316 and 2532 mammon 3126. 

6:25 Therefore 1223 5124 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, Take no 3361 thought 3309 5720 for your 5216 life 5590, what 5101 ye shall eat 5315 5632, or 2532 what 5101 ye shall drink 4095 5632; nor yet for 3366 your 5216 body 4983, what 5101 ye shall put on 1746 5672. Is 2076 5748 not 3780 the life 5590 more than 4119 meat 5160, and 2532 the body 4983 than raiment 1742? 

6:26 Behold 1689 5657 1519 the fowls 4071 of the air 3772: for 3754 they sow 4687 5719 not 3756, neither 3761 do they reap 2325 5719, nor 3761 gather 4863 5719 into 1519 barns 596; yet 2532 your 5216 heavenly 3770 Father 3962 feedeth 5142 5719 them 846. Are 1308 0 ye 5210 not 3756 much 3123 better than 1308 5719 they 846? 

6:27 1161 Which 1537 5101 of you 5216 by taking thought 3309 5723 can 1410 5736 add 4369 5629 one 1520 cubit 4083 unto 1909 his 848 stature 2244? 

6:28 And 2532 why 5101 take ye thought 3309 5720 for 4012 raiment 1742? Consider 2648 5628 the lilies 2918 of the field 68, how 4459 they grow 837 5719; they toil 2872 5719 not 3756, neither 3761 do they spin 3514 5719: 

6:29 And yet 1161 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, That 3754 even 3761 0 Solomon 4672 in 1722 all 3956 his 848 glory 1391 was 4016 0 not 3761 arrayed 4016 5639 like 5613 one 1520 of these 5130. 

6:30 Wherefore 1161, if 1487 God 2316 so 3779 clothe 294 5719 the grass 5528 of the field 68, which to day 4594 is 5607 5752, and 2532 to morrow 839 is cast 906 5746 into 1519 the oven 2823, [shall he] not 3756 much 4183 more 3123 [clothe] you 5209, O ye of little faith 3640? 

6:31 Therefore 3767 take no 3361 thought 3309 5661, saying 3004 5723, What 5101 shall we eat 5315 5632? or 2228, What 5101 shall we drink 4095 5632? or 2228, Wherewithal 5101 shall we be clothed 4016 5643? 

6:32 (For 1063 after 1934 0 all 3956 these things 5023 do the Gentiles 1484 seek 1934 5719) for 1063 your 5216 heavenly 3770 Father 3962 knoweth 1492 5758 that 3754 ye have need 5535 5719 of all 537 these things 5130. 

6:33 But 1161 seek ye 2212 5720 first 4412 the kingdom 932 of God 2316, and 2532 his 846 righteousness 1343; and 2532 all 3956 these things 5023 shall be added 4369 5701 unto you 5213. 

6:34 Take 3309 0 therefore 3767 no 3361 thought 3309 5661 for 1519 the morrow 839: for 1063 the morrow 839 shall take thought 3309 5692 for the things 3588 of itself 1438. Sufficient 713 unto the day 2250 [is] the evil 2549 thereof 846. 

7:1 Judge 2919 5720 not 3361, that 3363 0 ye be 2919 0 not 3363 judged 2919 5686. 

7:2 For 1722 with 3739 what 1063 judgment 2917 ye judge 2919 5719, ye shall be judged 2919 5701: and 2532 with 1722 what 3739 measure 3358 ye mete 3354 5719, it shall be measured 488 0 to you 5213 again 488 5701. 

7:3 And 1161 why 5101 beholdest 991 5719 thou the mote 2595 that is in 1722 thy 4675 brother's 80 eye 3788, but 1161 considerest 2657 5719 not 3756 the beam 1385 that is in 1722 thine own 4674 eye 3788? 

7:4 Or 2228 how 4459 wilt thou say 2046 5692 to thy 4675 brother 80, Let 863 5628 me pull out 1544 5632 the mote 2595 out of 575 thine 4675 eye 3788; and 2532, behold 2400 5628, a beam 1385 [is] in 1722 thine own 4675 eye 3788? 

7:5 Thou hypocrite 5273, first 4412 cast out 1544 5628 the beam 1385 out of 1537 thine own 4675 eye 3788; and 2532 then 5119 shalt thou see clearly 1227 5692 to cast out 1544 5629 the mote 2595 out of 1537 thy 4675 brother's 80 eye 3788. 

7:6 Give 1325 5632 not 3361 that which 3588 is holy 40 unto the dogs 2965, neither 3366 cast 906 5632 ye your 5216 pearls 3135 before 1715 swine 5519, lest 3379 they trample 2662 5661 them 846 under 1722 their 848 feet 4228, and 2532 turn again 4762 5651 and rend 4486 5661 you 5209. 

7:7 Ask 154 5720, and 2532 it shall be given 1325 5701 you 5213; seek 2212 5720, and 2532 ye shall find 2147 5692; knock 2925 5720, and 2532 it shall be opened 455 5691 unto you 5213: 

7:8 For 1063 every one 3956 that asketh 154 5723 receiveth 2983 5719; and 2532 he that seeketh 2212 5723 findeth 2147 5719; and 2532 to him that knocketh 2925 5723 it shall be opened 455 5691. 

7:9 Or 2228 what 5101 man 444 is 2076 5748 there of 1537 you 5216, whom 3739 if 1437 his 846 son 5207 ask 154 5661 bread 740, will he give 3361 1929 5692 him 846 a stone 3037? 

7:10 Or 2532 if 1437 he ask 154 5661 a fish 2486, will he give 3361 1929 5692 him 846 a serpent 3789? 

7:11 If 1487 ye 5210 then 3767, being 5607 5752 evil 4190, know 1492 5758 how to give 1325 5721 good 18 gifts 1390 unto your 5216 children 5043, how much 4214 more 3123 shall your 5216 Father 3962 which 3588 is in 1722 heaven 3772 give 1325 5692 good things 18 to them that ask 154 5723 him 846? 

7:12 Therefore 3767 all things 3956 whatsoever 302 3745 ye would 2309 5725 that 2443 men 444 should do 4160 5725 to you 5213, do 4160 5720 ye 5210 even 2532 so 3779 to them 846: for 1063 this 3778 is 2076 5748 the law 3551 and 2532 the prophets 4396. 

7:13 Enter ye in 1525 5628 at 1223 the strait 4728 gate 4439: for 3754 wide 4116 [is] the gate 4439, and 2532 broad 2149 [is] the way 3598, that leadeth 520 5723 to 1519 destruction 684, and 2532 many 4183 there be 1526 5748 which 3588 go in 1525 5740 thereat 1223 846: 

7:14 Because 3754 strait 4728 [is] the gate 4439, and 2532 narrow 2346 5772 [is] the way 3598, which 3588 leadeth 520 5723 unto 1519 life 2222, and 2532 few 3641 there be 1526 5748 that find 2147 5723 it 846. 

7:15 Beware 1161 4337 5720 of 575 false prophets 5578, which 3748 come 2064 5736 to 4314 you 5209 in 1722 sheep's 4263 clothing 1742, but 1161 inwardly 2081 they are 1526 5748 ravening 727 wolves 3074. 

7:16 Ye shall know 1921 5695 them 846 by 575 their fruits 2590 3385. Do men gather 4816 5719 grapes 4718 of 575 thorns 173, or 2228 figs 4810 of 575 thistles 5146? 

7:17 Even so 3779 every 3956 good 18 tree 1186 bringeth forth 4160 5719 good 2570 fruit 2590; but 1161 a corrupt 4550 tree 1186 bringeth forth 4160 5719 evil 4190 fruit 2590. 

7:18 A good 18 tree 1186 cannot 3756 1410 5736 bring forth 4160 5721 evil 4190 fruit 2590, neither 3761 [can] a corrupt 4550 tree 1186 bring forth 4160 5721 good 2570 fruit 2590. 

7:19 Every 3956 tree 1186 that bringeth 4160 0 not 3361 forth 4160 5723 good 2570 fruit 2590 is hewn down 1581 5743, and 2532 cast 906 5743 into 1519 the fire 4442. 

7:20 Wherefore 686 by 575 their 846 fruits 2590 ye shall know 1921 5695 them 846. 

7:21 Not 3756 every one 3956 that saith 3004 5723 unto me 3427, Lord 2962, Lord 2962, shall enter 1525 5695 into 1519 the kingdom 932 of heaven 3772; but 235 he that doeth 4160 5723 the will 2307 of my 3450 Father 3962 which is in 1722 heaven 3772. 

7:22 Many 4183 will say 2046 5692 to me 3427 in 1722 that 1565 day 2250, Lord 2962, Lord 2962, have we 4395 0 not 3756 prophesied 4395 5656 in thy 4674 name 3686? and 2532 in thy 4674 name 3686 have cast out 1544 5627 devils 1140? and 2532 in thy 4674 name 3686 done 4160 5656 many 4183 wonderful works 1411? 

7:23 And 2532 then 5119 will I profess 3670 5692 unto them 846, 3754 I never 3763 knew 1097 5627 you 5209: depart 672 5720 from 575 me 1700, ye that work 2038 5740 iniquity 458. 

7:24 Therefore 3767 whosoever 3956 3748 heareth 191 5719 these 5128 sayings 3056 of mine 3450, and 2532 doeth 4160 5719 them 846, I will liken 3666 5692 him 846 unto a wise 5429 man 435, which 3748 built 3618 5656 his 848 house 3614 upon 1909 a rock 4073: 

7:25 And 2532 the rain 1028 descended 2597 5627, and 2532 the floods 4215 came 2064 5627, and 2532 the winds 417 blew 4154 5656, and 2532 beat upon 4363 5627 that 1565 house 3614; and 2532 it fell 4098 5627 not 3756: for 1063 it was founded 2311 5718 upon 1909 a rock 4073. 

7:26 And 2532 every one 3956 that heareth 191 5723 these 5128 sayings 3056 of mine 3450, and 2532 doeth 4160 5723 them 846 not 3361, shall be likened 3666 5701 unto a foolish 3474 man 435, which 3748 built 3618 5656 his 848 house 3614 upon 1909 the sand 285: 

7:27 And 2532 the rain 1028 descended 2597 5627, and 2532 the floods 4215 came 2064 5627, and 2532 the winds 417 blew 4154 5656, and 2532 beat upon 4350 5656 that 1565 house 3614; and 2532 it fell 4098 5627: and 2532 great 3173 was 2258 5713 the fall 4431 of it 846. 

7:28 And 2532 it came to pass 1096 5633, when 3753 Jesus 2424 had ended 4931 5656 these 5128 sayings 3056, the people 3793 were astonished 1605 5712 at 1909 his 846 doctrine 1322: 

7:29 For 1063 he taught 1321 5723 2258 5713 them 846 as 5613 [one] having 2192 5723 authority 1849, and 2532 not 3756 as 5613 the scribes 1122. 

8:1 When 1161 he 846 was come down 2597 5631 from 575 the mountain 3735, great 4183 multitudes 3793 followed 190 5656 him 846. 

8:2 And 2532, behold 2400 5628, there came 2064 5631 a leper 3015 and worshipped 4352 5707 him 846, saying 3004 5723, Lord 2962, if 1437 thou wilt 2309 5725, thou canst 1410 5736 make 2511 0 me 3165 clean 2511 5658. 

8:3 And 2532 Jesus 2424 put forth 1614 5660 [his] hand 5495, and touched 680 5662 him 846, saying 3004 5723, I will 2309 5719; be thou clean 2511 5682. And 2532 immediately 2112 his 846 leprosy 3014 was cleansed 2511 5681. 

8:4 And 2532 Jesus 2424 saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, See 3708 5720 thou tell 2036 5632 no man 3367; but 235 go thy way 5217 5720, shew 1166 5657 thyself 4572 to the priest 2409, and 2532 offer 4374 5628 the gift 1435 that Moses 3475 commanded 4367 5656, for 1519 a testimony 3142 unto them 846. 

8:5 And 1161 when 1525 0 Jesus 2424 was entered 1525 5631 into 1519 Capernaum 2584, there came 4334 5627 unto him 846 a centurion 1543, beseeching 3870 5723 him 846, 

8:6 And 2532 saying 3004 5723, Lord 2962, my 3450 servant 3816 lieth 906 5769 at 1722 home 3614 sick of the palsy 3885, grievously 1171 tormented 928 5746. 

8:7 And 2532 Jesus 2424 saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, I 1473 will come 2064 5631 and heal 2323 5692 him 846. 

8:8 The centurion 1543 answered 611 5679 and 2532 said 5346 5713, Lord 2962, I am 1510 5748 not 3756 worthy 2425 that 2443 thou shouldest come 1525 5632 under 5259 my 3450 roof 4721: but 235 speak 2036 5628 the word 3056 only 3440, and 2532 my 3450 servant 3816 shall be healed 2390 5701. 

8:9 For 1063 2532 I 1473 am 1510 5748 a man 444 under 5259 authority 1849, having 2192 5723 soldiers 4757 under 5259 me 1683: and 2532 I say 3004 5719 to this 5129 [man], Go 4198 5676, and 2532 he goeth 4198 5736; and 2532 to another 243, Come 2064 5736, and 2532 he cometh 2064 5736; and 2532 to my 3450 servant 1401, Do 4160 5657 this 5124, and 2532 he doeth 4160 5719 [it]. 

8:10 When 1161 Jesus 2424 heard 191 5660 [it], he marvelled 2296 5656, and 2532 said 2036 5627 to them that followed 190 5723, Verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, I have 2147 0 not 3761 0 found 2147 5627 so great 5118 faith 4102, no, not 3761 in 1722 Israel 2474. 

8:11 And 1161 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, That 3754 many 4183 shall come 2240 5692 from 575 the east 395 and 2532 west 1424, and 2532 shall sit down 347 5701 with 3326 Abraham 11, and 2532 Isaac 2464, and 2532 Jacob 2384, in 1722 the kingdom 932 of heaven 3772. 

8:12 But 1161 the children 5207 of the kingdom 932 shall be cast out 1544 5701 into 1519 outer 1857 darkness 4655: there 1563 shall be 2071 5704 weeping 2805 and 2532 gnashing 1030 of teeth 3599. 

8:13 And 2532 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627 unto the centurion 1543, Go thy way 5217 5720; and 2532 as 5613 thou hast believed 4100 5656, [so] be it done 1096 5676 unto thee 4671. And 2532 his 846 servant 3816 was healed 2390 5681 in 1722 the selfsame 1565 hour 5610. 

8:14 And 2532 when Jesus 2424 was come 2064 5631 into 1519 Peter's 4074 house 3614, he saw 1492 5627 his 846 wife's mother 3994 laid 906 5772, and 2532 sick of a fever 4445 5723. 

8:15 And 2532 he touched 680 5662 her 846 hand 5495, and 2532 the fever 4446 left 863 5656 her 846: and 2532 she arose 1453 5681, and 2532 ministered 1247 5707 unto them 846. 

8:16 When 1161 the even 3798 was come 1096 5637, they brought 4374 5656 unto him 846 many 4183 that were possessed with devils 1139 5740: and 2532 he cast out 1544 5627 the spirits 4151 with [his] word 3056, and 2532 healed 2323 5656 all 3956 that were 2192 5723 sick 2560: 

8:17 That it might 3704 be fulfilled 4137 5686 which was spoken 4483 5685 by 1223 Esaias 2268 the prophet 4396, saying 3004 5723, Himself 846 took 2983 5627 our 2257 infirmities 769, and 2532 bare 941 5656 [our] sicknesses 3554. 

8:18 Now 1161 when Jesus 2424 saw 1492 5631 great 4183 multitudes 3793 about 4012 him 848, he gave commandment 2753 5656 to depart 565 5629 unto 1519 the other side 4008. 

8:19 And 2532 a certain 1520 scribe 1122 came 4334 5631, and said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Master 1320, I will follow 190 5692 thee 4671 whithersoever 1437 3699 thou goest 565 5741. 

8:20 And 2532 Jesus 2424 saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, The foxes 258 have 2192 5719 holes 5454, and 2532 the birds 4071 of the air 3772 [have] nests 2682; but 1161 the Son 5207 of man 444 hath 2192 5719 not 3756 where 4226 to lay 2827 5725 [his] head 2776. 

8:21 And 1161 another 2087 of his 846 disciples 3101 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Lord 2962, suffer 2010 5657 me 3427 first 4412 to go 565 5629 and 2532 bury 2290 5658 my 3450 father 3962. 

8:22 But 1161 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Follow 190 5720 me 3427; and 2532 let 863 5628 the dead 3498 bury 2290 5658 their 1438 dead 3498. 

8:23 And 2532 when he was entered 1684 5631 into 1519 a ship 4143, his 846 disciples 3101 followed 190 5656 him 846. 

8:24 And 2532, behold 2400 5628, there arose 1096 5633 a great 3173 tempest 4578 in 1722 the sea 2281, insomuch that 5620 the ship 4143 was covered 2572 5745 with 5259 the waves 2949: but 1161 he 846 was asleep 2518 5707. 

8:25 And 2532 his 846 disciples 3101 came 4334 5631 to [him], and awoke 1453 5656 him 846, saying 3004 5723, Lord 2962, save 4982 5657 us 2248: we perish 622 5731. 

8:26 And 2532 he saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Why 5101 are ye 2075 5748 fearful 1169, O ye of little faith 3640? Then 5119 he arose 1453 5685, and rebuked 2008 5656 the winds 417 and 2532 the sea 2281; and 2532 there was 1096 5633 a great 3173 calm 1055. 

8:27 But 1161 the men 444 marvelled 2296 5656, saying 3004 5723, What manner of man 4217 is 2076 5748 this 3778, that 3754 even 2532 the winds 417 and 2532 the sea 2281 obey 5219 5719 him 846! 

8:28 And 2532 when he 846 was come 2064 5631 to 1519 the other side 4008 into 1519 the country 5561 of the Gergesenes 1086, there met 5221 5656 him 846 two 1417 possessed with devils 1139 5740, coming 1831 5740 out of 1537 the tombs 3419, exceeding 3029 fierce 5467, so that 5620 no 3361 man 5100 might 2480 5721 pass 3928 5629 by 1223 that 1565 way 3598. 

8:29 And 2532, behold 2400 5628, they cried out 2896 5656, saying 3004 5723, What 5101 have we 2254 to do with 2532 thee 4671, Jesus 2424, thou Son 5207 of God 2316? art thou come 2064 5627 hither 5602 to torment 928 5658 us 2248 before 4253 the time 2540? 

8:30 And 1161 there was 2258 5713 a good way off 3112 from 575 them 846 an herd 34 of many 4183 swine 5519 feeding 1006 5746. 

8:31 So 1161 the devils 1142 besought 3870 5707 him 846, saying 3004 5723, If 1487 thou cast 1544 0 us 2248 out 1544 5719, suffer 2010 5657 us 2254 to go away 565 5629 into 1519 the herd 34 of swine 5519. 

8:32 And 2532 he said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Go 5217 5720. And 1161 when they were come out 1831 5631, they went 565 5627 into 1519 the herd 34 of swine 5519: and 2532, behold 2400 5628, the whole 3956 herd 34 of swine 5519 ran violently 3729 5656 down 2596 a steep place 2911 into 1519 the sea 2281, and 2532 perished 599 5627 in 1722 the waters 5204. 

8:33 And 1161 they that kept 1006 5723 them fled 5343 5627, and 2532 went their ways 565 5631 into 1519 the city 4172, and told 518 5656 every thing 3956, and 2532 what was befallen to the possessed of the devils 1139 5740. 

8:34 And 2532, behold 2400 5628, the whole 3956 city 4172 came out 1831 5627 to 1519 meet 4877 Jesus 2424: and 2532 when they saw 1492 5631 him 846, they besought 3870 5656 [him] that 3704 he would depart 3327 5632 out of 575 their coasts 3725. 

9:1 And 2532 he entered 1684 5631 into 1519 a ship 4143, and passed over 1276 5656, and 2532 came 2064 5627 into 1519 his own 2398 city 4172. 

9:2 And 2532, behold 2400 5628, they brought 4374 5707 to him 846 a man sick of the palsy 3885, lying 906 5772 on 1909 a bed 2825: and 2532 Jesus 2424 seeing 1492 5631 their 846 faith 4102 said 2036 5627 unto the sick of the palsy 3885; Son 5043, be of good cheer 2293 5720; thy 4675 sins 266 be forgiven 863 5769 thee 4671. 

9:3 And 2532, behold 2400 5628, certain 5100 of the scribes 1122 said 2036 5627 within 1722 themselves 1438, This 3778 [man] blasphemeth 987 5719. 

9:4 And 2532 Jesus 2424 knowing 1492 5631 their 846 thoughts 1761 said 2036 5627, Wherefore 2444 think 1760 5736 ye 5210 evil 4190 in 1722 your 5216 hearts 2588? 

9:5 For 1063 whether 5101 is 2076 5748 easier 2123, to say 2036 5629, [Thy] sins 266 be forgiven 863 5769 thee 4671; or 2228 to say 2036 5629, Arise 1453 5669, and 2532 walk 4043 5720? 

9:6 But 1161 that 2443 ye may know 1492 5762 that 3754 the Son 5207 of man 444 hath 2192 5719 power 1849 on 1909 earth 1093 to forgive 863 5721 sins 266, (then 5119 saith he 3004 5719 to the sick of the palsy 3885) Arise 1453 5685, take up 142 5657 thy 4675 bed 2825, and 2532 go 5217 5720 unto 1519 thine 4675 house 3624. 

9:7 And 2532 he arose 1453 5685, and departed 565 5627 to 1519 his 848 house 3624. 

9:8 But 1161 when the multitudes 3793 saw 1492 5631 [it], they marvelled 2296 5656, and 2532 glorified 1392 5656 God 2316, which 3588 had given 1325 5631 such 5108 power 1849 unto men 444. 

9:9 And as 2532 Jesus 2424 passed forth 3855 5723 from thence 1564, he saw 1492 5627 a man 444, named 3004 5746 Matthew 3156, sitting 2521 5740 at 1909 the receipt of custom 5058: and 2532 he saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, Follow 190 5720 me 3427. And 2532 he arose 450 5631, and followed 190 5656 him 846. 

9:10 And 2532 it came to pass 1096 5633, as Jesus 2424 sat at meat 345 5740 in 1722 the house 3614, 2532 behold 2400 5628, many 4183 publicans 5057 and 2532 sinners 268 came 2064 5631 and sat down 4873 5711 with him and 2532 his 846 disciples 3101. 

9:11 And 2532 when the Pharisees 5330 saw 1492 5631 [it], they said 2036 5627 unto his 846 disciples 3101, Why 1302 eateth 2068 5719 your 5216 Master 1320 with 3326 publicans 5057 and 2532 sinners 268? 

9:12 But 1161 when Jesus 2424 heard 191 5660 [that], he said 2036 5627 unto them 846, They that be 2192 5719 whole 2480 5723 need 5532 not 3756 a physician 2395, but 235 they that are 2192 5723 sick 2560. 

9:13 But 1161 go ye 4198 5679 and learn 3129 5628 what 5101 [that] meaneth 2076 5748, I will 2309 5719 have mercy 1656, and 2532 not 3756 sacrifice 2378: for 1063 I am 2064 0 not 3756 come 2064 5627 to call 2564 5658 the righteous 1342, but 235 sinners 268 to 1519 repentance 3341. 

9:14 Then 5119 came 4334 5736 to him 846 the disciples 3101 of John 2491, saying 3004 5723, Why 1302 do we 2249 and 2532 the Pharisees 5330 fast 3522 5719 oft 4183, but 1161 thy 4675 disciples 3101 fast 3522 5719 not 3756? 

9:15 And 2532 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Can 3361 1410 5736 the children 5207 of the bridechamber 3567 mourn 3996 5721, as long as 1909 3745 the bridegroom 3566 is 2076 5748 with 3326 them 846? but 1161 the days 2250 will come 2064 5695, when 3752 the bridegroom 3566 shall be taken 522 5686 from 575 them 846, and 2532 then 5119 shall they fast 3522 5692. 

9:16 1161 No man 3762 putteth 1911 5719 a piece 1915 of new 46 cloth 4470 unto 1909 an old 3820 garment 2440, for 1063 that which is put in to fill it up 4138 taketh 142 5719 from 575 the garment 2440, and 2532 the rent 4978 is made 1096 5736 worse 5501. 

9:17 Neither 3761 do men put 906 5719 new 3501 wine 3631 into 1519 old 3820 bottles 779: else 1490 the bottles 779 break 4486 5743, and 2532 the wine 3631 runneth out 1632 5743, and 2532 the bottles 779 perish 622 5698: but 235 they put 906 5719 new 3501 wine 3631 into 1519 new 2537 bottles 779, and 2532 both 297 are preserved 4933 5743. 

9:18 While he spake 2980 5723 these things 5023 unto them 846, behold 2400 5628, there came 2064 5631 a certain ruler 758, and worshipped 4352 5707 him 846, saying 3004 5723, 3754 My 3450 daughter 2364 is even now 737 dead 5053 5656: but 235 come 2064 5631 and lay 2007 5628 thy 4675 hand 5495 upon 1909 her 846, and 2532 she shall live 2198 5695. 

9:19 And 2532 Jesus 2424 arose 1453 5685, and followed 190 5656 him, and 2532 [so did] his 846 disciples 3101. 

9:20 And 2532, behold 2400 5628, a woman 1135, which was diseased with an issue of blood 131 5723 twelve 1427 years 2094, came 4334 5631 behind 3693 [him], and touched 680 5662 the hem 2899 of his 846 garment 2440: 

9:21 For 1063 she said 3004 5707 within 1722 herself 1438, If 1437 I may 680 0 but 3440 touch 680 5672 his 846 garment 2440, I shall be whole 4982 5701. 

9:22 But 1161 Jesus 2424 turned him about 1994 5651, and 2532 when he saw 1492 5631 her 846, he said 2036 5627, Daughter 2364, be of good comfort 2293 5720; thy 4675 faith 4102 hath made 4982 0 thee 4571 whole 4982 5758. And 2532 the woman 1135 was made whole 4982 5681 from 575 that 1565 hour 5610. 

9:23 And 2532 when Jesus 2424 came 2064 5631 into 1519 the ruler's 758 house 3614, and 2532 saw 1492 5631 the minstrels 834 and 2532 the people 3793 making a noise 2350 5746, 

9:24 He said 3004 5719 unto them 846, Give place 402 5720: for 1063 the maid 2877 is 599 0 not 3756 dead 599 5627, but 235 sleepeth 2518 5719. And 2532 they laughed 2606 0 him 846 to scorn 2606 5707. 

9:25 But 1161 when 3753 the people 3793 were put forth 1544 5681, he went in 1525 5631, and took 2902 5656 her 846 by the hand 5495, and 2532 the maid 2877 arose 1453 5681. 

9:26 And 2532 the fame 5345 hereof 3778 went abroad 1831 5627 into 1519 all 3650 that 1565 land 1093. 

9:27 And 2532 when Jesus 2424 departed 3855 5723 thence 1564, two 1417 blind men 5185 followed 190 5656 him 846, crying 2896 5723, and 2532 saying 3004 5723, [Thou] Son 5207 of David 1138, have mercy 1653 5657 on us 2248. 

9:28 And 1161 when he was come 2064 5631 into 1519 the house 3614, the blind men 5185 came 4334 5656 to him 846: and 2532 Jesus 2424 saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Believe ye 4100 5720 that 3754 I am able 1410 5736 to do 4160 5658 this 5124? They said 3004 5719 unto him 846, Yea 3483, Lord 2962. 

9:29 Then 5119 touched he 680 5662 their 846 eyes 3788, saying 3004 5723, According 2596 to your 5216 faith 4102 be it 1096 5676 unto you 5213. 

9:30 And 2532 their 846 eyes 3788 were opened 455 5681; and 2532 Jesus 2424 straitly charged 1690 5662 them 846, saying 3004 5723, See 3708 5720 [that] no man 3367 know 1097 5720 [it]. 

9:31 But 1161 they, when they were departed 1831 5631, spread abroad 1310 0 his 846 fame 1310 5656 in 1722 all 3650 that 1565 country 1093. 

9:32 As 1161 they went out 1831 5740, behold 2400 5628, they brought 4374 5656 to him 846 a dumb 2974 man 444 possessed with a devil 1139 5740. 

9:33 And 2532 when the devil 1140 was cast out 1544 5685, the dumb 2974 spake 2980 5656: and 2532 the multitudes 3793 marvelled 2296 5656, saying 3004 5723, 3754 It was never 3763 so 3779 seen 5316 5648 in 1722 Israel 2474. 

9:34 But 1161 the Pharisees 5330 said 3004 5707, He casteth out 1544 5719 devils 1140 through 1722 the prince 758 of the devils 1140. 

9:35 And 2532 Jesus 2424 went about 4013 5707 all 3956 the cities 4172 and 2532 villages 2968, teaching 1321 5723 in 1722 their 846 synagogues 4864, and 2532 preaching 2784 5723 the gospel 2098 of the kingdom 932, and 2532 healing 2323 5723 every 3956 sickness 3554 and 2532 every 3956 disease 3119 among 1722 the people 2992. 

9:36 But 1161 when he saw 1492 5631 the multitudes 3793, he was moved with compassion 4697 5675 on 4012 them 846, because 3754 they fainted 2258 5713 1590 5772, and 2532 were scattered abroad 4496 5772, as 5616 sheep 4263 having 2192 5723 no 3361 shepherd 4166. 

9:37 Then 5119 saith 3004 5719 he unto his 848 disciples 3101, The harvest 2326 truly 3303 [is] plenteous 4183, but 1161 the labourers 2040 [are] few 3641; 

9:38 Pray ye 1189 5676 therefore 3767 the Lord 2962 of the harvest 2326, that 3704 he will send forth 1544 5632 labourers 2040 into 1519 his 848 harvest 2326. 

10:1 And 2532 when he had called 4341 5666 unto [him] his 846 twelve 1427 disciples 3101, he gave 1325 5656 them 846 power 1849 [against] unclean 169 spirits 4151, to 5620 cast 1544 0 them 846 out 1544 5721, and 2532 to heal 2323 5721 all manner 3956 of sickness 3554 and 2532 all manner 3956 of disease 3119. 

10:2 Now 1161 the names 3686 of the twelve 1427 apostles 652 are 2076 5748 these 5023; The first 4413, Simon 4613, who 3588 is called 3004 5746 Peter 4074, and 2532 Andrew 406 his 846 brother 80; James 2385 [the son] of 3588 Zebedee 2199, and 2532 John 2491 his 846 brother 80; 

10:3 Philip 5376, and 2532 Bartholomew 918; Thomas 2381, and 2532 Matthew 3156 the publican 5057; James 2385 [the son] of 3588 Alphaeus 256, and 2532 Lebbaeus 3002, whose surname was 1941 5685 Thaddaeus 2280; 

10:4 Simon 4613 the Canaanite 2581, and 2532 Judas 2455 Iscariot 2469, who 3588 also 2532 betrayed 3860 5631 him 846. 

10:5 These 5128 twelve 1427 Jesus 2424 sent forth 649 5656, and commanded 3853 5660 them 846, saying 3004 5723, Go 565 5632 not 3361 into 1519 the way 3598 of the Gentiles 1484, and 2532 into 1519 [any] city 4172 of the Samaritans 4541 enter ye 1525 5632 not 3361: 

10:6 But 1161 go 4198 5737 rather 3123 to 4314 the lost 622 5756 sheep 4263 of the house 3624 of Israel 2474. 

10:7 And 1161 as ye go 4198 5740, preach 2784 5720, saying 3004 5723, 3754 The kingdom 932 of heaven 3772 is at hand 1448 5758. 

10:8 Heal 2323 5720 the sick 770 5723, cleanse 2511 5720 the lepers 3015, raise 1453 5720 the dead 3498, cast out 1544 5720 devils 1140: freely 1432 ye have received 2983 5627, freely 1432 give 1325 5628. 

10:9 Provide 2932 5667 neither 3361 gold 5557, nor 3366 silver 696, nor 3366 brass 5475 in 1519 your 5216 purses 2223, 

10:10 Nor 3361 scrip 4082 for 1519 [your] journey 3598, neither 3366 two 1417 coats 5509, neither 3366 shoes 5266, nor 3366 yet staves 4464: for 1063 the workman 2040 is 2076 5748 worthy 514 of his 848 meat 5160. 

10:11 And 1161 into 1519 whatsoever 302 3739 city 4172 or 2228 town 2968 ye shall enter 1525 5632, enquire 1833 5657 who 5101 in 1722 it 846 is 2076 5748 worthy 514; and there 2546 abide 3306 5657 till 302 2193 ye go thence 1831 5632. 

10:12 And 1161 when ye come 1525 5740 into 1519 an house 3614, salute 782 5663 it 846. 

10:13 And 2532 if 1437 3303 the house 3614 be 5600 5753 worthy 514, let your 5216 peace 1515 come 2064 5628 upon 1909 it 846: but 1161 if 3362 0 it be 5600 5753 not 3362 worthy 514, let your 5216 peace 1515 return 1994 5649 to 4314 you 5209. 

10:14 And 2532 whosoever 3739 shall 1209 0 not 3362 receive 1209 5667 you 5209, nor 3366 hear 191 5661 your 5216 words 3056, when ye depart out 1831 5740 of that 1565 house 3614 or 2228 city 4172, shake off 1621 5657 the dust 2868 of your 5216 feet 4228. 

10:15 Verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, It shall be 2071 5704 more tolerable 414 for the land 1093 of Sodom 4670 and 2532 Gomorrha 1116 in 1722 the day 2250 of judgment 2920, than 2228 for that 1565 city 4172. 

10:16 Behold 2400 5628, I 1473 send 649 0 you 5209 forth 649 5719 as 5613 sheep 4263 in 1722 the midst 3319 of wolves 3074: be ye 1096 5737 therefore 3767 wise 5429 as 5613 serpents 3789, and 2532 harmless 185 as 5613 doves 4058. 

10:17 But 1161 beware 4337 5720 of 575 men 444: for 1063 they will deliver 3860 0 you 5209 up 3860 5692 to 1519 the councils 4892, and 2532 they will scourge 3146 5692 you 5209 in 1722 their 848 synagogues 4864; 

10:18 And 2532 ye shall be brought 71 5701 before 1909 governors 2232 and 2532 1161 kings 935 for my 1752 sake 1700, for 1519 a testimony 3142 against them 846 and 2532 the Gentiles 1484. 

10:19 But 1161 when 3752 they deliver 3860 0 you 5209 up 3860 5725, take 3309 0 no 3361 thought 3309 5661 how 4459 or 2228 what 5101 ye shall speak 2980 5661: for 1063 it shall be given 1325 5701 you 5213 in 1722 that same 1565 hour 5610 what 5101 ye shall speak 2980 5692. 

10:20 For 1063 it is 2075 5748 not 3756 ye 5210 that speak 2980 5723, but 235 the Spirit 4151 of your 5216 Father 3962 which 3588 speaketh 2980 5723 in 1722 you 5213. 

10:21 And 1161 the brother 80 shall deliver up 3860 5692 the brother 80 to 1519 death 2288, and 2532 the father 3962 the child 5043: and 2532 the children 5043 shall rise up 1881 5695 against 1909 [their] parents 1118, and 2532 cause 2289 0 them 846 to be put to death 2289 5692. 

10:22 And 2532 ye shall 2071 5704 be hated 3404 5746 of 5259 all 3956 [men] for 1223 my 3450 name's sake 3686: but 1161 he that 5056 endureth 5278 5660 to 1519 the end 3778 shall be saved 4982 5701. 

10:23 But 1161 when 3752 they persecute 1377 5725 you 5209 in 1722 this 5026 city 4172, flee ye 5343 5720 into 1519 another 243: for 1063 verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, Ye shall 5055 0 not 3364 have gone over 5055 5661 the cities 4172 of Israel 2474, till 2193 the Son 5207 of man 444 be 302 come 2064 5632. 

10:24 The disciple 3101 is 2076 5748 not 3756 above 5228 [his] master 1320, nor 3761 the servant 1401 above 5228 his 848 lord 2962. 

10:25 It is enough 713 for the disciple 3101 that 2443 he be 1096 5638 as 5613 his 846 master 1320, and 2532 the servant 1401 as 5613 his 846 lord 2962. If 1487 they have called 2564 5656 the master of the house 3617 Beelzebub 954, how much 4214 more 3123 [shall they call] them of his 846 household 3615? 

10:26 Fear 5399 5676 them 846 not 3361 therefore 3767: for 1063 there is 2076 5748 nothing 3762 covered 2572 5772, that shall 601 0 not 3756 be revealed 601 5701; and 2532 hid 2927, that shall 1097 0 not 3756 be known 1097 5701. 

10:27 What 3739 I tell 3004 5719 you 5213 in 1722 darkness 4653, [that] speak ye 2036 5628 in 1722 light 5457: and 2532 what 3739 ye hear 191 5719 in 1519 the ear 3775, [that] preach ye 2784 5657 upon 1909 the housetops 1430. 

10:28 And 2532 fear 5399 5676 575 not 3361 them which 3588 kill 615 5723 the body 4983, but 1161 are 1410 0 not 3361 able 1410 5740 to kill 615 5658 the soul 5590: but 1161 rather 3123 fear 5399 5676 him which 3588 is able 1410 5740 to destroy 622 5658 both 2532 soul 5590 and 2532 body 4983 in 1722 hell 1067. 

10:29 Are 4453 0 not 3780 two 1417 sparrows 4765 sold 4453 5743 for a farthing 787? and 2532 one 1520 of 1537 them 846 shall 4098 0 not 3756 fall 4098 5695 on 1909 the ground 1093 without 427 your 5216 Father 3962. 

10:30 But 1161 the very 2532 hairs 2359 of your 5216 head 2776 are 1526 5748 all 3956 numbered 705 5772. 

10:31 Fear ye 5399 5676 not 3361 therefore 3767, ye 5210 are of more value 1308 5719 than many 4183 sparrows 4765. 

10:32 Whosoever 3956 3748 therefore 3767 shall confess 3670 5692 1722 me 1698 before 1715 men 444, 1722 him 846 will I confess 3670 5692 also 2504 before 1715 my 3450 Father 3962 which 3588 is in 1722 heaven 3772. 

10:33 But 1161 whosoever 3748 shall 302 deny 720 5667 me 3165 before 1715 men 444, him 846 will I also 2504 deny 720 5695 before 1715 my 3450 Father 3962 which 3588 is in 1722 heaven 3772. 

10:34 Think 3543 5661 not 3361 that 3754 I am come 2064 5627 to send 906 5629 peace 1515 on 1909 earth 1093: I came 2064 5627 not 3756 to send 906 5629 peace 1515, but 235 a sword 3162. 

10:35 For 1063 I am come 2064 5627 to set 1369 0 a man 444 at variance 1369 5658 against 2596 his 846 father 3962, and 2532 the daughter 2364 against 2596 her 846 mother 3384, and 2532 the daughter in law 3565 against 2596 her 846 mother in law 3994. 

10:36 And 2532 a man's 444 foes 2190 [shall be] they of his own 846 household 3615. 

10:37 He that loveth 5368 5723 father 3962 or 2228 mother 3384 more than 5228 me 1691 is 2076 5748 not 3756 worthy 514 of me 3450: and 2532 he that loveth 5368 5723 son 5207 or 2228 daughter 2364 more than 5228 me 1691 is 2076 5748 not 3756 worthy 514 of me 3450. 

10:38 And 2532 he 3739 that taketh 2983 5719 not 3756 his 848 cross 4716, and 2532 followeth 190 5719 after 3694 me 3450, is 2076 5748 not 3756 worthy 514 of me 3450. 

10:39 He that findeth 2147 5631 his 848 life 5590 shall lose 622 5692 it 846: and 2532 he that loseth 622 5660 his 848 life 5590 for my 1700 sake 1752 shall find 2147 5692 it 846. 

10:40 He that receiveth 1209 5740 you 5209 receiveth 1209 5736 me 1691, and 2532 he that receiveth 1209 5740 me 1691 receiveth 1209 5736 him that sent 649 5660 me 3165. 

10:41 He that receiveth 1209 5740 a prophet 4396 in 1519 the name 3686 of a prophet 4396 shall receive 2983 5695 a prophet's 4396 reward 3408; and 2532 he that receiveth 2983 5695 a righteous man 1342 in 1519 the name 3686 of a righteous man 1342 shall receive 1209 5740 a righteous man's 1342 reward 3408. 

10:42 And 2532 whosoever 1437 shall give to drink 4222 5661 unto one 1520 of these 5130 little ones 3398 a cup 4221 of cold 5593 [water] only 3440 in 1519 the name 3686 of a disciple 3101, verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, he shall in no wise 3364 lose 622 5661 his 848 reward 3408. 

11:1 And 2532 it came to pass 1096 5633, when 3753 Jesus 2424 had made an end 5055 5656 of commanding 1299 5723 his 848 twelve 1427 disciples 3101, he departed 3327 5627 thence 1564 to teach 1321 5721 and 2532 to preach 2784 5721 in 1722 their 846 cities 4172. 

11:2 Now 1161 when John 2491 had heard 191 5660 in 1722 the prison 1201 the works 2041 of Christ 5547, he sent 3992 5660 two 1417 of his 848 disciples 3101, 

11:3 And said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Art 1488 5748 thou 4771 he that should come 2064 5740, or 2228 do we look 4328 5719 for another 2087? 

11:4 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5679 and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Go 4198 5679 and shew 518 0 John 2491 again 518 5657 those things which 3739 ye do hear 191 5719 and 2532 see 991 5719: 

11:5 The blind 5185 receive their sight 308 5719, and 2532 the lame 5560 walk 4043 5719, the lepers 3015 are cleansed 2511 5743, and 2532 the deaf 2974 hear 191 5719, the dead 3498 are raised up 1453 5743, and 2532 the poor 4434 have the gospel preached to them 2097 5743. 

11:6 And 2532 blessed 3107 is 2076 5748 [he], whosoever 3739 shall 4624 0 not 3362 be offended 4624 5686 in 1722 me 1698. 

11:7 And 1161 as 5130 they departed 4198 5740, Jesus 2424 began 756 5662 to say 3004 5721 unto the multitudes 3793 concerning 4012 John 2491, What 5101 went ye 1831 5627 out into 1519 the wilderness 2048 to see 2300 5664? A reed 2563 shaken 4531 5746 with 5259 the wind 417? 

11:8 But 235 what 5101 went ye out 1831 5627 for to see 1492 5629? A man 444 clothed 294 5772 in 1722 soft 3120 raiment 2440? behold 2400 5628, they that wear 5409 5723 soft 3120 [clothing] are 1526 5748 in 1722 kings 935' houses 3624. 

11:9 But 235 what 5101 went ye out 1831 5627 for to see 1492 5629? A prophet 4396? yea 3483, I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, and 2532 more 4055 than a prophet 4396. 

11:10 For 1063 this 3778 is 2076 5748 [he], of 4012 whom 3739 it is written 1125 5769, Behold 2400 5628, I 1473 send 649 5719 my 3450 messenger 32 before 4253 thy 4675 face 4383, which 3739 shall prepare 2680 5692 thy 4675 way 3598 before 1715 thee 4675. 

11:11 Verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, Among 1722 them that are born 1084 of women 1135 there hath 1453 0 not 3756 risen 1453 5769 a greater than 3187 John 2491 the Baptist 910: notwithstanding 1161 he that is least 3398 in 1722 the kingdom 932 of heaven 3772 is 2076 5748 greater than 3187 he 846. 

11:12 And 1161 from 575 the days 2250 of John 2491 the Baptist 910 until 2193 now 737 the kingdom 932 of heaven 3772 suffereth violence 971 5731 5743, and 2532 the violent 973 take 726 0 it 846 by force 726 5719. 

11:13 For 1063 all 3956 the prophets 4396 and 2532 the law 3551 prophesied 4395 5656 until 2193 John 2491. 

11:14 And 2532 if 1487 ye will 2309 5719 receive 1209 5664 [it], this 846 is 2076 5748 Elias 2243, which 3588 was for 3195 5723 to come 2064 5738. 

11:15 He that hath 2192 5723 ears 3775 to hear 191 5721, let him hear 191 5720. 

11:16 But 1161 whereunto 5101 shall I liken 3666 5692 this 5026 generation 1074? It is 2076 5748 like 3664 unto children 3808 sitting 2521 5740 in 1722 the markets 58, and 2532 calling 4377 5723 unto their 848 fellows 2083, 

11:17 And 2532 saying 3004 5723, We have piped 832 5656 unto you 5213, and 2532 ye have 3738 0 not 3756 danced 3738 5662; we have mourned 2354 5656 unto you 5213, and 2532 ye have 2875 0 not 3756 lamented 2875 5668. 

11:18 For 1063 John 2491 came 2064 5627 neither 3383 eating 2068 5723 nor 3383 drinking 4095 5723, and 2532 they say 3004 5719, He hath 2192 5719 a devil 1140. 

11:19 The Son 5207 of man 444 came 2064 5627 eating 2068 5723 and 2532 drinking 4095 5723, and 2532 they say 3004 5719, Behold 2400 5628 a man 444 gluttonous 5314, and 2532 a winebibber 3630, a friend 5384 of publicans 5057 and 2532 sinners 268. But 2532 wisdom 4678 is justified 1344 5681 of 575 her 848 children 5043. 

11:20 Then 5119 began he 756 5662 to upbraid 3679 5721 the cities 4172 wherein 1722 3739 most 4118 of his 846 mighty works 1411 were done 1096 5633, because 3754 they repented 3340 5656 not 3756: 

11:21 Woe 3759 unto thee 4671, Chorazin 5523! woe 3759 unto thee 4671, Bethsaida 966! for 3754 if 1487 the mighty works 1411, which 3588 were done 1096 5637 in 1722 you 5213, had been done 1096 5633 in 1722 Tyre 5184 and 2532 Sidon 4605, they would have repented 3340 5656 long ago 302 3819 in 1722 sackcloth 4526 and 2532 ashes 4700. 

11:22 But 4133 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, It shall be 2071 5704 more tolerable 414 for Tyre 5184 and 2532 Sidon 4605 at 1722 the day 2250 of judgment 2920, than 2228 for you 5213. 

11:23 And 2532 thou 4771, Capernaum 2584, which 3588 art exalted 5312 5685 unto 2193 heaven 3772, shalt be brought down 2601 5701 to 2193 hell 86: for 3754 if 1487 the mighty works 1411, which 3588 have been done 1096 5637 in 1722 thee 4671, had been done 1096 5633 in 1722 Sodom 4670, it would have remained 302 3306 5656 until 3360 this day 4594. 

11:24 But 4133 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, That 3754 it shall be 2071 5704 more tolerable 414 for the land 1093 of Sodom 4670 in 1722 the day 2250 of judgment 2920, than 2228 for thee 4671. 

11:25 At 1722 that 1565 time 2540 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627, I thank 1843 5731 thee 4671, O Father 3962, Lord 2962 of heaven 3772 and 2532 earth 1093, because 3754 thou hast hid 613 5656 these things 5023 from 575 the wise 4680 and 2532 prudent 4908, and 2532 hast revealed 601 5656 them 846 unto babes 3516. 

11:26 Even so 3483, Father 3962: for 3754 so 3779 it seemed 1096 5633 good 2107 in thy 4675 sight 1715. 

11:27 All things 3956 are delivered 3860 5681 unto me 3427 of 5259 my 3450 Father 3962: and 2532 no man 3762 knoweth 1921 5719 the Son 5207, but 1508 the Father 3962; neither 3761 knoweth 1921 5719 any man 5100 the Father 3962, save 1508 the Son 5207, and [he] 2532 to 3739 whomsoever 1437 the Son 5207 will 1014 5741 reveal 601 5658 [him]. 

11:28 Come 1205 5773 unto 4314 me 3165, all 3956 [ye] that labour 2872 5723 and 2532 are heavy laden 5412 5772, and 2532 I 2504 will give 373 0 you 5209 rest 373 5692. 

11:29 Take 142 5657 my 3450 yoke 2218 upon 1909 you 5209, and 2532 learn 3129 5628 of 575 me 1700; for 3754 I am 1510 5748 meek 4235 and 2532 lowly 5011 in heart 2588: and 2532 ye shall find 2147 5692 rest 372 unto your 5216 souls 5590. 

11:30 For 1063 my 3450 yoke 2218 [is] easy 5543, and 2532 my 3450 burden 5413 is 2076 5748 light 1645. 

12:1 At 1722 that 1565 time 2540 Jesus 2424 went 4198 5675 on the sabbath day 4521 through 1223 the corn 4702; and 1161 his 846 disciples 3101 were an hungred 3983 5656, and 2532 began 756 5662 to pluck 5089 5721 the ears of corn 4719, and 2532 to eat 2068 5721. 

12:2 But 1161 when the Pharisees 5330 saw 1492 5631 [it], they said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Behold 2400 5628, thy 4675 disciples 3101 do 4160 5719 that which 3739 is 1832 0 not 3756 lawful 1832 5748 to do 4160 5721 upon 1722 the sabbath day 4521. 

12:3 But 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Have ye 314 0 not 3756 read 314 5627 what 5101 David 1138 did 4160 5656, when 3753 he was an hungred 3983 5656, and 2532 they 3326 that were with him 846; 

12:4 How 4459 he entered into 1525 5627 1519 the house 3624 of God 2316, and 2532 did eat 5315 5627 the shewbread 740 4286, which 3739 was 2258 5713 not 3756 lawful 1832 5752 for him 846 to eat 5315 5629, neither for 3761 them which 3326 were with him 846, but 1508 only 3441 for the priests 2409? 

12:5 Or 2228 have ye 314 0 not 3756 read 314 5627 in 1722 the law 3551, how that 3754 on the sabbath days 4521 the priests 2409 in 1722 the temple 2411 profane 953 5719 the sabbath 4521, and 2532 are 1526 5748 blameless 338? 

12:6 But 1161 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, That 3754 in this place 5602 is [one] 2076 5748 greater than 3187 the temple 2411. 

12:7 But 1161 if 1487 ye had known 1097 5715 what 5101 [this] meaneth 2076 5748, I will have 2309 5719 mercy 1656, and 2532 not 3756 sacrifice 2378, ye would 302 not 3756 have condemned 2613 5656 the guiltless 338. 

12:8 For 1063 the Son 5207 of man 444 is 2076 5748 Lord 2962 even 2532 of the sabbath day 4521. 

12:9 And 2532 when he was departed 3327 5631 thence 1564, he went 2064 5627 into 1519 their 846 synagogue 4864: 

12:10 And 2532, behold 2400 5628, there was 2258 5713 a man 444 which had 2192 5723 [his] hand 5495 withered 3584. And 2532 they asked 1905 5656 him 846, saying 3004 5723, Is it lawful 1487 1832 5748 to heal 2323 5721 on the sabbath days 4521? that 2443 they might accuse 2723 5661 him 846. 

12:11 And 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto them 846, What 5101 man 444 shall there be 2071 5704 among 1537 you 5216, that 3739 shall have 2192 5692 one 1520 sheep 4263, and 2532 if 1437 it 5124 fall 1706 5632 into 1519 a pit 999 on the sabbath day 4521, will he 2902 0 not 3780 lay hold 2902 5692 on it 846, and 2532 lift [it] out 1453 5692? 

12:12 How much 4214 then 3767 is a man 444 better than 1308 5719 a sheep 4263? Wherefore 5620 it is lawful 1832 5748 to do 4160 5721 well 2573 on the sabbath days 4521. 

12:13 Then 5119 saith 3004 5719 he to the man 444, Stretch forth 1614 5657 thine 4675 hand 5495. And 2532 he stretched [it] forth 1614 5656; and 2532 it was restored 600 5681 whole 5199, like as 5613 the other 243. 

12:14 Then 1161 the Pharisees 5330 went out 1831 5631, and held 2983 5627 a council 4824 against 2596 him 846, how 3704 they might destroy 622 5661 him 846. 

12:15 But 1161 when Jesus 2424 knew 1097 5631 [it], he withdrew himself 402 5656 from thence 1564: and 2532 great 4183 multitudes 3793 followed 190 5656 him 846, and 2532 he healed 2323 5656 them 846 all 3956; 

12:16 And 2532 charged 2008 5656 them 846 that 3363 0 they should 4160 0 not 3363 make 4160 5661 him 846 known 5318: 

12:17 That 3704 it might be fulfilled 4137 5686 which 3588 was spoken 4483 5685 by 1223 Esaias 2268 the prophet 4396, saying 3004 5723, 

12:18 Behold 2400 5628 my 3450 servant 3816, whom 3739 I have chosen 140 5656; my 3450 beloved 27, in 1519 whom 3739 my 3450 soul 5590 is well pleased 2106 5656: I will put 5087 5692 my 3450 spirit 4151 upon 1909 him 846, and 2532 he shall shew 518 5692 judgment 2920 to the Gentiles 1484. 

12:19 He shall 2051 0 not 3756 strive 2051 5692, nor 3761 cry 2905 5692; neither 3761 shall any man 5100 hear 191 5692 his 846 voice 5456 in 1722 the streets 4113. 

12:20 A bruised 4937 5772 reed 2563 shall he 2608 0 not 3756 break 2608 5656, and 2532 smoking 5188 5746 flax 3043 shall he 4570 0 not 3756 quench 4570 5692, till 2193 302 he send forth 1544 5632 judgment 2920 unto 1519 victory 3534. 

12:21 And 2532 in 1722 his 846 name 3686 shall 1679 0 the Gentiles 1484 trust 1679 5692. 

12:22 Then 5119 was brought 4374 5681 unto him 846 one possessed with a devil 1139 5740, blind 5185, and 2532 dumb 2974: and 2532 he healed 2323 5656 him 846, insomuch that 5620 the blind 5185 and 2532 dumb 2974 both 2532 spake 2980 5721 and 2532 saw 991 5721. 

12:23 And 2532 all 3956 the people 3793 were amazed 1839 5710, and 2532 said 3004 5707, Is 2076 5748 not 3385 this 3778 the son 5207 of David 1138? 

12:24 But 1161 when the Pharisees 5330 heard 191 5660 [it], they said 2036 5627, This 3778 [fellow] doth 1544 0 not 3756 cast out 1544 5719 devils 1140, but 1508 by 1722 Beelzebub 954 the prince 758 of the devils 1140. 

12:25 And 1161 Jesus 2424 knew 1492 5761 their 846 thoughts 1761, and said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Every 3956 kingdom 932 divided 3307 5685 against 2596 itself 1438 is brought to desolation 2049 5743; and 2532 every 3956 city 4172 or 2228 house 3614 divided 3307 5685 against 2596 itself 1438 shall 2476 0 not 3756 stand 2476 5701: 

12:26 And 2532 if 1487 Satan 4567 cast out 1544 5719 Satan 4567, he is divided 3307 5681 against 1909 himself 1438; how 4459 shall 2476 0 then 3767 his kingdom 932 stand 2476 5701? 

12:27 And 2532 if 1487 I 1473 by 1722 Beelzebub 954 cast out 1544 5719 devils 1140, by 1722 whom 5101 do your 5216 children 5207 cast [them] out 1544 5719? therefore 5124 1223 they 846 shall be 2071 5704 your 5216 judges 2923. 

12:28 But 1161 if 1487 I 1473 cast out 1544 5719 devils 1140 by 1722 the Spirit 4151 of God 2316, then 686 the kingdom 932 of God 2316 is come 5348 5656 unto 1909 you 5209. 

12:29 Or 2228 else how 4459 can 1410 5736 one 5100 enter 1525 5629 into 1519 a strong man's 2478 house 3614, and 2532 spoil 1283 5658 his 846 goods 4632, except 3362 he first 4412 bind 1210 5661 the strong man 2478? and 2532 then 5119 he will spoil 1283 5692 his 846 house 3614. 

12:30 He that is 5607 5752 not 3361 with 3326 me 1700 is 2076 5748 against 2596 me 1700; and 2532 he that gathereth 4863 5723 not 3361 with 3326 me 1700 scattereth abroad 4650 5719. 

12:31 Wherefore 1223 5124 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, All manner of 3956 sin 266 and 2532 blasphemy 988 shall be forgiven 863 5701 unto men 444: but 1161 the blasphemy 988 [against] the [Holy] Ghost 4151 shall 863 0 not 3756 be forgiven 863 5701 unto men 444. 

12:32 And 2532 whosoever 302 speaketh 2036 5632 a word 3056 against 2596 the Son 5207 of man 444, it shall be forgiven 863 5701 him 846: but 3739 whosoever 302 speaketh 2036 5632 against 2596 the Holy 40 Ghost 4151, it shall 863 0 not 3756 be forgiven 863 5701 him 846, neither 3777 in 1722 this 5129 world 165, neither 3777 in 1722 the [world] to come 3195 5723. 

12:33 Either 2228 make 4160 5657 the tree 1186 good 2570, and 2532 his 846 fruit 2590 good 2570; or else 2228 make 4160 5657 the tree 1186 corrupt 4550, and 2532 his 846 fruit 2590 corrupt 4550: for 1063 the tree 1186 is known 1097 5743 by 1537 [his] fruit 2590. 

12:34 O generation 1081 of vipers 2191, how 4459 can ye 1410 5736, being 5607 5752 evil 4190, speak 2980 5721 good things 18? for 1063 out of 1537 the abundance 4051 of the heart 2588 the mouth 4750 speaketh 2980 5719. 

12:35 A good 18 man 444 out of 1537 the good 18 treasure 2344 of the heart 2588 bringeth forth 1544 5719 good things 18: and 2532 an evil 4190 man 444 out of 1537 the evil 4190 treasure 2344 bringeth forth 1544 5719 evil things 4190. 

12:36 But 1161 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, That 3754 every 3956 idle 692 word 4487 that 1437 men 444 shall speak 2980 5661, they shall give 591 5692 account 3056 thereof 4012 846 in 1722 the day 2250 of judgment 2920. 

12:37 For 1063 by 1537 thy 4675 words 3056 thou shalt be justified 1344 5701, and 2532 by 1537 thy 4675 words 3056 thou shalt be condemned 2613 5701. 

12:38 Then 5119 certain 5100 of the scribes 1122 and 2532 of the Pharisees 5330 answered 611 5662, saying 3004 5723, Master 1320, we would 2309 5719 see 1492 5629 a sign 4592 from 575 thee 4675. 

12:39 But 1161 he answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627 unto them 846, An evil 4190 and 2532 adulterous 3428 generation 1074 seeketh after 1934 5719 a sign 4592; and 2532 there shall no 3756 sign 4592 be given 1325 5701 to it 846, but 1508 the sign 4592 of the prophet 4396 Jonas 2495: 

12:40 For 1063 as 5618 Jonas 2495 was 2258 5713 three 5140 days 2250 and 2532 three 5140 nights 3571 in 1722 the whale's 2785 belly 2836; so 3779 shall the Son 5207 of man 444 be 2071 5704 three 5140 days 2250 and 2532 three 5140 nights 3571 in 1722 the heart 2588 of the earth 1093. 

12:41 The men 435 of Nineveh 3536 shall rise 450 5698 in 1722 judgment 2920 with 3326 this 5026 generation 1074, and 2532 shall condemn 2632 5692 it 846: because 3754 they repented 3340 5656 at 1519 the preaching 2782 of Jonas 2495; and 2532, behold 2400 5628, a greater than 4119 Jonas 2495 [is] here 5602. 

12:42 The queen 938 of the south 3558 shall rise up 1453 5701 in 1722 the judgment 2920 with 3326 this 5026 generation 1074, and 2532 shall condemn 2632 5692 it 846: for 3754 she came 2064 5627 from 1537 the uttermost parts 4009 of the earth 1093 to hear 191 5658 the wisdom 4678 of Solomon 4672; and 2532, behold 2400 5628, a greater than 4119 Solomon 4672 [is] here 5602. 

12:43 1161 When 3752 the unclean 169 spirit 4151 is gone 1831 5632 out of 575 a man 444, he walketh 1330 5736 through 1223 dry 504 places 5117, seeking 2212 5723 rest 372, and 2532 findeth 2147 5719 none 3756. 

12:44 Then 5119 he saith 3004 5719, I will return 1994 5692 into 1519 my 3450 house 3624 from whence 3606 I came out 1831 5627; and 2532 when he is come 2064 5631, he findeth 2147 5719 [it] empty 4980 5723, swept 4563 5772, and 2532 garnished 2885 5772. 

12:45 Then 5119 goeth he 4198 5736, and 2532 taketh 3880 5719 with 3326 himself 1438 seven 2033 other 2087 spirits 4151 more wicked 4191 than himself 1438, and 2532 they enter in 1525 5631 and dwell 2730 5719 there 1563: and 2532 the last 2078 [state] of that 1565 man 444 is 1096 5736 worse than 5501 the first 4413. Even so 3779 shall it be 2071 5704 also 2532 unto this 5026 wicked 4190 generation 1074. 

12:46 While 2089 he 846 yet 1161 talked 2980 5723 to the people 3793, behold 2400 5628, [his] mother 3384 and 2532 his brethren 80 stood 2476 5715 without 1854, desiring 2212 5723 to speak 2980 5658 with him 846. 

12:47 Then 1161 one 5100 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Behold 2400 5628, thy 4675 mother 3384 and 2532 thy 4675 brethren 80 stand 2476 5758 without 1854, desiring 2212 5723 to speak 2980 5658 with thee 4671. 

12:48 But 1161 he answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627 unto him 846 that told 2036 5631 him 846, Who 5101 is 2076 5748 my 3450 mother 3384? and 2532 who 5101 are 1526 5748 my 3450 brethren 80? 

12:49 And 2532 he stretched forth 1614 5660 his 848 hand 5495 toward 1909 his 848 disciples 3101, and said 2036 5627, Behold 2400 5628 my 3450 mother 3384 and 2532 my 3450 brethren 80! 

12:50 For 1063 whosoever 3748 302 shall do 4160 5661 the will 2307 of my 3450 Father 3962 which 3588 is in 1722 heaven 3772, the same is 2076 5748 my 3450 brother 80, and 2532 sister 79, and 2532 mother 3384. 

13:1 1161 The same 1722 1565 day 2250 went 1831 5631 Jesus 2424 out of 575 the house 3614, and sat 2521 5711 by 3844 the sea side 2281. 

13:2 And 2532 great 4183 multitudes 3793 were gathered together 4863 5681 unto 4314 him 846, so that 5620 he went 1684 5631 into 1519 a ship 4143, and sat 2521 5738; and 2532 the whole 3956 multitude 3793 stood 2476 5715 on 1909 the shore 123. 

13:3 And 2532 he spake 2980 5656 many things 4183 unto them 846 in 1722 parables 3850, saying 3004 5723, Behold 2400 5628, a sower 4687 5723 went forth 1831 5627 to sow 4687 5721; 

13:4 And 2532 when 1722 he 846 sowed 4687 5721, some 3739 3303 [seeds] fell 4098 5627 by 3844 the way side 3598, and 2532 the fowls 4071 came 2064 5627 and 2532 devoured 2719 0 them 846 up 2719 5627: 

13:5 Some 1161 243 fell 4098 5627 upon 1909 stony places 4075, where 3699 they had 2192 5707 not 3756 much 4183 earth 1093: and 2532 forthwith 2112 they sprung up 1816 5656, because 1223 they had 2192 5721 no 3361 deepness 899 of earth 1093: 

13:6 And 1161 when the sun 2246 was up 393 5660, they were scorched 2739 5681; and 2532 because 1223 they had 2192 5721 no 3361 root 4491, they withered away 3583 5681. 

13:7 And 1161 some 243 fell 4098 5627 among 1909 thorns 173; and 2532 the thorns 173 sprung up 305 5627, and 2532 choked 638 5656 them 846: 

13:8 But 1161 other 243 fell 4098 5627 into 1909 good 2570 ground 1093, and 2532 brought forth 1325 5707 fruit 2590, some 3303 an hundredfold 1540, some 1161 sixtyfold 1835, some 1161 thirtyfold 5144. 

13:9 Who 3588 hath 2192 5723 ears 3775 to hear 191 5721, let him hear 191 5720. 

13:10 And 2532 the disciples 3101 came 4334 5631, and said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Why 1302 speakest thou 2980 5719 unto them 846 in 1722 parables 3850? 

13:11 He answered 611 5679 and 1161 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Because 3754 it is given 1325 5769 unto you 5213 to know 1097 5629 the mysteries 3466 of the kingdom 932 of heaven 3772, but 1161 to them 1565 it is 1325 0 not 3756 given 1325 5769. 

13:12 For 1063 whosoever 3748 hath 2192 5719, to him 846 shall be given 1325 5701, and 2532 he shall have more abundance 4052 5701: but 1161 whosoever 3748 hath 2192 5719 not 3756, from 575 him 846 shall be taken away 142 5701 even that 2532 he hath 2192 5719. 

13:13 Therefore 1223 5124 speak I 2980 5719 to them 846 in 1722 parables 3850: because 3754 they seeing 991 5723 see 991 5719 not 3756; and 2532 hearing 191 5723 they hear 191 5719 not 3756, neither 3761 do they understand 4920 5719. 

13:14 And 2532 in 1909 them 846 is fulfilled 378 5743 the prophecy 4394 of Esaias 2268, which 3588 saith 3004 5723, By hearing 189 ye shall hear 191 5692, and 2532 shall 4920 0 not 3364 understand 4920 5655; and 2532 seeing 991 5723 ye shall see 991 5692, and 2532 shall 1492 0 not 3364 perceive 1492 5632: 

13:15 For 1063 this 5127 people's 2992 heart 2588 is waxed gross 3975 5681, and 2532 [their] ears 3775 are dull 917 of hearing 191 5656, and 2532 their 848 eyes 3788 they have closed 2576 5656; lest at any time 3379 they should see 1492 5632 with [their] eyes 3788, and 2532 hear 191 5661 with [their] ears 3775, and 2532 should understand 4920 5632 with [their] heart 2588, and 2532 should be converted 1994 5661, and 2532 I should heal 2390 5667 them 846. 

13:16 But 1161 blessed 3107 [are] your 5216 eyes 3788, for 3754 they see 991 5719: and 2532 your 5216 ears 3775, for 3754 they hear 191 5719. 

13:17 For 1063 verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, That 3754 many 4183 prophets 4396 and 2532 righteous 1342 [men] have desired 1937 5656 to see 1492 5629 [those things] which 3739 ye see 991 5719, and 2532 have 1492 0 not 3756 seen 1492 5627 [them]; and 2532 to hear 191 5658 [those things] which 3739 ye hear 191 5719, and 2532 have 191 0 not 3756 heard 191 5656 [them]. 

13:18 Hear 191 5657 ye 5210 therefore 3767 the parable 3850 of the sower 4687 5723. 

13:19 When any 3956 one heareth 191 5723 the word 3056 of the kingdom 932, and 2532 understandeth 4920 5723 [it] not 3361, then cometh 2064 5736 the wicked 4190 [one], and 2532 catcheth away 726 5719 that which 3588 was sown 4687 5772 in 1722 his 846 heart 2588. This 3778 is 2076 5748 he which received seed 4687 5651 by 3844 the way side 3598. 

13:20 But 1161 he that received the seed 4687 5651 into 1909 stony places 4075, the same 3778 is 2076 5748 he that heareth 191 5723 the word 3056, and 2532 anon 2117 with 3326 joy 5479 receiveth 2983 5723 it 846; 

13:21 Yet 1161 hath he 2192 5719 not 3756 root 4491 in 1722 himself 1438, but 235 dureth 2076 5748 for a while 4340: for 1161 when tribulation 2347 or 2228 persecution 1375 ariseth 1096 5637 because 1223 of the word 3056, by and by 2117 he is offended 4624 5743. 

13:22 He also 1161 that received seed 4687 5651 among 1519 the thorns 173 is 2076 5748 he that 3778 heareth 191 5723 the word 3056; and 2532 the care 3308 of this 5127 world 165, and 2532 the deceitfulness 539 of riches 4149, choke 4846 5719 the word 3056, and 2532 he becometh 1096 5736 unfruitful 175. 

13:23 But 1161 he that received seed 4687 5651 into 1909 the good 2570 ground 1093 is 2076 5748 he 3778 that heareth 191 5723 the word 3056, and 2532 understandeth 4920 5723 [it]; which 3739 also 1211 beareth fruit 2592 5719, and 2532 bringeth forth 4160 5719, some 3303 an hundredfold 1540, some 1161 sixty 1835, some 1161 thirty 5144. 

13:24 Another 243 parable 3850 put he forth 3908 5656 unto them 846, saying 3004 5723, The kingdom 932 of heaven 3772 is likened 3666 5681 unto a man 444 which sowed 4687 5723 5625 4687 5660 good 2570 seed 4690 in 1722 his 848 field 68: 

13:25 But 1161 while 1722 men 444 slept 2518 5721, his 846 enemy 2190 came 2064 5627 and 2532 sowed 4687 5656 tares 2215 among 303 3319 the wheat 4621, and 2532 went his way 565 5627. 

13:26 But 1161 when 3753 the blade 5528 was sprung up 985 5656, and 2532 brought forth 4160 5656 fruit 2590, then 5119 appeared 5316 5648 the tares 2215 also 2532. 

13:27 So 1161 the servants 1401 of the householder 3617 came 4334 5631 and said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Sir 2962, didst 4687 0 not 3780 thou sow 4687 5656 good 2570 seed 4690 in 1722 thy 4674 field 68? from whence 4159 then 3767 hath it 2192 5719 tares 2215? 

13:28 1161 He said 5346 5713 unto them 846, An enemy 2190 444 hath done 4160 5656 this 5124. 1161 The servants 1401 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Wilt thou 2309 5719 then 3767 that we go 565 5631 and gather 4816 0 them 846 up 4816 5661? 

13:29 But 1161 he said 5346 5713, Nay 3756; lest 3379 while ye gather up 4816 5723 the tares 2215, ye root up 1610 5661 also the wheat 4621 with 260 them 846. 

13:30 Let 863 5628 both 297 grow together 4885 5745 until 3360 the harvest 2326: and 2532 in 1722 the time 2540 of harvest 2326 I will say 2046 5692 to the reapers 2327, Gather ye together 4816 5657 first 4412 the tares 2215, and 2532 bind 1210 5657 them 846 in 1519 bundles 1197 to 4314 burn 2618 5658 them 846: but 1161 gather 4863 5628 the wheat 4621 into 1519 my 3450 barn 596. 

13:31 Another 243 parable 3850 put he forth 3908 5656 unto them 846, saying 3004 5723, The kingdom 932 of heaven 3772 is 2076 5748 like 3664 to a grain 2848 of mustard seed 4615, which 3739 a man 444 took 2983 5631, and sowed 4687 5656 in 1722 his 848 field 68: 

13:32 Which 3739 indeed 3303 is 2076 5748 the least 3398 of all 3956 seeds 4690: but 1161 when 3752 it is grown 837 5686, it is 2076 5748 the greatest 3187 among herbs 3001, and 2532 becometh 1096 5736 a tree 1186, so that 5620 the birds 4071 of the air 3772 come 2064 5629 and 2532 lodge 2681 5721 in 1722 the branches 2798 thereof 846. 

13:33 Another 243 parable 3850 spake he 2980 5656 unto them 846; The kingdom 932 of heaven 3772 is 2076 5748 like 3664 unto leaven 2219, which 3739 a woman 1135 took 2983 5631, and hid 1470 5656 in 1519 three 5140 measures 4568 of meal 224, till 2193 the whole 3650 was 3739 leavened 2220 5681. 

13:34 All 3956 these things 5023 spake 2980 5656 Jesus 2424 unto the multitude 3793 in 1722 parables 3850; and 2532 without 5565 a parable 3850 spake he 2980 5707 not 3756 unto them 846: 

13:35 That 3704 it might be fulfilled 4137 5686 which 3588 was spoken 4483 5685 by 1223 the prophet 4396, saying 3004 5723, I will open 455 5692 my 3450 mouth 4750 in 1722 parables 3850; I will utter 2044 5695 things which have been kept secret 2928 5772 from 575 the foundation 2602 of the world 2889. 

13:36 Then 5119 Jesus 2424 sent 863 0 the multitude 3793 away 863 5631, and went 2064 5627 into 1519 the house 3614: and 2532 his 846 disciples 3101 came 4334 5656 unto him 846, saying 3004 5723, Declare 5419 5657 unto us 2254 the parable 3850 of the tares 2215 of the field 68. 

13:37 He answered 611 5679 and 1161 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, He that soweth 4687 5723 the good 2570 seed 4690 is 2076 5748 the Son 5207 of man 444; 

13:38 1161 The field 68 is 2076 5748 the world 2889; 1161 the good 2570 seed 4690 are 3778 1526 5748 the children 5207 of the kingdom 932; but 1161 the tares 2215 are 1526 5748 the children 5207 of the wicked 4190 [one]; 

13:39 1161 The enemy 2190 that sowed 4687 5660 them 846 is 2076 5748 the devil 1228; 1161 the harvest 2326 is 2076 5748 the end 4930 of the world 165; and 1161 the reapers 2327 are 1526 5748 the angels 32. 

13:40 As 5618 therefore 3767 the tares 2215 are gathered 4816 5743 and 2532 burned 2618 5743 in the fire 4442; so 3779 shall it be 2071 5704 in 1722 the end 4930 of this 5127 world 165. 

13:41 The Son 5207 of man 444 shall send forth 649 5692 his 848 angels 32, and 2532 they shall gather 4816 5692 out of 1537 his kingdom 932 all things 3956 that offend 4625, and 2532 them which do 4160 5723 iniquity 458; 

13:42 And 2532 shall cast 906 5692 them 846 into 1519 a furnace 2575 of fire 4442: there 1563 shall be 2071 5704 wailing 2805 and 2532 gnashing 1030 of teeth 3599. 

13:43 Then 5119 shall the righteous 1342 shine forth 1584 5692 as 5613 the sun 2246 in 1722 the kingdom 932 of their 848 Father 3962. Who 3588 hath 2192 5723 ears 3775 to hear 191 5721, let him hear 191 5720. 

13:44 Again 3825, the kingdom 932 of heaven 3772 is 2076 5748 like 3664 unto treasure 2344 hid 2928 5772 in 1722 a field 68; the which 3739 when a man 444 hath found 2147 5631, he hideth 2928 5656, and 2532 for 575 joy 5479 thereof 846 goeth 5217 5719 and 2532 selleth 4453 5719 all 3956 that 3745 he hath 2192 5719, and 2532 buyeth 59 5719 that 1565 field 68. 

13:45 Again 3825, the kingdom 932 of heaven 3772 is 2076 5748 like 3664 unto a merchant 1713 man 444, seeking 2212 5723 goodly 2570 pearls 3135: 

13:46 Who 3739, when he had found 2147 5631 one 1520 pearl 3135 of great price 4186, went 565 5631 and sold 4097 5758 all 3956 that 3745 he had 2192 5707, and 2532 bought 59 5656 it 846. 

13:47 Again 3825, the kingdom 932 of heaven 3772 is 2076 5748 like 3664 unto a net 4522, that was cast 906 5685 into 1519 the sea 2281, and 2532 gathered 4863 5631 of 1537 every 3956 kind 1085: 

13:48 Which 3739, when 3753 it was full 4137 5681, they drew 307 5660 to 1909 shore 123, and 2532 sat down 2523 5660, and gathered 4816 5656 the good 2570 into 1519 vessels 30, but 1161 cast 906 5627 the bad 4550 away 1854. 

13:49 So 3779 shall it be 2071 5704 at 1722 the end 4930 of the world 165: the angels 32 shall come forth 1831 5695, and 2532 sever 873 5692 the wicked 4190 from 1537 among 3319 the just 1342, 

13:50 And 2532 shall cast 906 5692 them 846 into 1519 the furnace 2575 of fire 4442: there 1563 shall be 2071 5704 wailing 2805 and 2532 gnashing 1030 of teeth 3599. 

13:51 Jesus 2424 saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Have ye understood 4920 5656 all 3956 0 these 5023 things 3956? They say 3004 5719 unto him 846, Yea 3483, Lord 2962. 

13:52 Then 1161 said 2036 5627 he unto them 846, Therefore 1223 5124 every 3956 scribe 1122 [which is] instructed 3100 5685 unto 1519 the kingdom 932 of heaven 3772 is 2076 5748 like 3664 unto a man 444 [that is] an householder 3617, which 3748 bringeth forth 1544 5719 out of 1537 his 848 treasure 2344 [things] new 2537 and 2532 old 3820. 

13:53 And 2532 it came to pass 1096 5633, [that] when 3753 Jesus 2424 had finished 5055 5656 these 5025 parables 3850, he departed 3332 5656 thence 1564. 

13:54 And 2532 when he was come 2064 5631 into 1519 his own 848 country 3968, he taught 1321 5707 them 846 in 1722 their 846 synagogue 4864, insomuch that 5620 they were astonished 1605 5745, and 2532 said 3004 5721, Whence 4159 hath this [man] 5129 this 3778 wisdom 4678, and 2532 [these] mighty works 1411? 

13:55 Is 2076 5748 not 3756 this 3778 the carpenter's 5045 son 5207? is 3004 0 not 3780 his 846 mother 3384 called 3004 5743 Mary 3137? and 2532 his 846 brethren 80, James 2385, and 2532 Joses 2500, and 2532 Simon 4613, and 2532 Judas 2455? 

13:56 And 2532 his 846 sisters 79, are they 1526 5748 not 3780 all 3956 with 4314 us 2248? Whence 4159 then 3767 hath this [man] 5129 all 3956 these things 5023? 

13:57 And 2532 they were offended 4624 5712 in 1722 him 846. But 1161 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, A prophet 4396 is 2076 5748 not 3756 without honour 820, save 1508 in 1722 his own 848 country 3968, and 2532 in 1722 his own 848 house 3614. 

13:58 And 2532 he did 4160 5656 not 3756 many 4183 mighty works 1411 there 1563 because 1223 of their 846 unbelief 570. 

14:1 At 1722 that 1565 time 2540 Herod 2264 the tetrarch 5076 heard 191 5656 of the fame 189 of Jesus 2424, 

14:2 And 2532 said 2036 5627 unto his 848 servants 3816, This 3778 is 2076 5748 John 2491 the Baptist 910; he 846 is risen 1453 5681 from 575 the dead 3498; and 2532 therefore 1223 5124 mighty works 1411 do shew forth themselves 1754 5719 in 1722 him 846. 

14:3 For 1063 Herod 2264 had laid hold 2902 5660 on John 2491, and bound 1210 5656 him 846, and 2532 put 5087 5639 [him] in 1722 prison 5438 for 1223 0 Herodias' 2266 sake 1223, his 848 brother 80 Philip's 5376 wife 1135. 

14:4 For 1063 John 2491 said 3004 5707 unto him 846, It is 1832 0 not 3756 lawful 1832 5748 for thee 4671 to have 2192 5721 her 846. 

14:5 And 2532 when he would 2309 5723 have put 615 0 him 846 to death 615 5658, he feared 5399 5675 the multitude 3793, because 3754 they counted 2192 5707 him 846 as 5613 a prophet 4396. 

14:6 But 1161 when Herod's 2264 birthday 1077 was kept 71 5746, the daughter 2364 of Herodias 2266 danced 3738 5662 before them 1722 3319, and 2532 pleased 700 5656 Herod 2264. 

14:7 Whereupon 3606 he promised 3670 5656 with 3326 an oath 3727 to give 1325 5629 her 846 whatsoever 1437 she would ask 154 5672. 

14:8 And 1161 she, being before instructed 4264 5685 of 5259 her 848 mother 3384, said 5346 5748, Give 1325 5628 me 3427 here 5602 John 2491 Baptist's 910 head 2776 in 1909 a charger 4094. 

14:9 And 2532 the king 935 was sorry 3076 5681: nevertheless for 1161 1223 the oath's sake 3727, and 2532 them which sat with him at meat 4873 5740, he commanded 2753 5656 [it] to be given 1325 5683 [her]. 

14:10 And 2532 he sent 3992 5660, and beheaded 607 5656 John 2491 in 1722 the prison 5438. 

14:11 And 2532 his 846 head 2776 was brought 5342 5681 in 1909 a charger 4094, and 2532 given 1325 5681 to the damsel 2877: and 2532 she brought 5342 5656 [it] to her 848 mother 3384. 

14:12 And 2532 his 846 disciples 3101 came 4334 5631, and took up 142 5656 the body 4983, and 2532 buried 2290 5656 it 846, and 2532 went 2064 5631 and told 518 5656 Jesus 2424. 

14:13 When 2532 Jesus 2424 heard 191 5660 [of it], he departed 402 5656 thence 1564 by 1722 ship 4143 into 1519 a desert 2048 place 5117 apart 2596 2398: and 2532 when the people 3793 had heard 191 5660 [thereof], they followed 190 5656 him 846 on foot 3979 out of 575 the cities 4172. 

14:14 And 2532 Jesus 2424 went forth 1831 5631, and saw 1492 5627 a great 4183 multitude 3793, and 2532 was moved with compassion 4697 5675 toward 1909 them 846, and 2532 he healed 2323 5656 their 846 sick 732. 

14:15 And 1161 when it was 1096 5637 evening 3798, his 846 disciples 3101 came 4334 5656 to him 846, saying 3004 5723, This is 2076 5748 a desert 2048 place 5117, and 2532 the time 5610 is now 2235 past 3928 5627; send 630 0 the multitude 3793 away 630 5657, that 2443 they may go 565 5631 into 1519 the villages 2968, and buy 59 5661 themselves 1438 victuals 1033. 

14:16 But 1161 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, They need 5532 not 3756 depart 565 5629 2192 5719; give 1325 5628 ye 5210 them 846 to eat 5315 5629. 

14:17 And 1161 they say 3004 5719 unto him 846, We have 2192 5719 here 5602 but 3756 1508 five 4002 loaves 740, and 2532 two 1417 fishes 2486. 

14:18 1161 He said 2036 5627, Bring 5342 5720 them 846 hither 5602 to me 3427. 

14:19 And 2532 he commanded 2753 5660 the multitude 3793 to sit down 347 5683 on 1909 the grass 5528, and 2532 took 2983 5631 the five 4002 loaves 740, and 2532 the two 1417 fishes 2486, and looking up 308 5660 to 1519 heaven 3772, he blessed 2127 5656, and 2532 brake 2806 5660, and gave 1325 5656 the loaves 740 to [his] disciples 3101, and 1161 the disciples 3101 to the multitude 3793. 

14:20 And 2532 they did 5315 0 all 3956 eat 5315 5627, and 2532 were filled 5526 5681: and 2532 they took up 142 5656 of the fragments 2801 that remained 4052 5723 twelve 1427 baskets 2894 full 4134. 

14:21 And 1161 they that had eaten 2068 5723 were 2258 5713 about 5616 five thousand 4000 men 435, beside 5565 women 1135 and 2532 children 3813. 

14:22 And 2532 straightway 2112 Jesus 2424 constrained 315 5656 his 848 disciples 3101 to get 1684 5629 into 1519 a ship 4143, and 2532 to go before 4254 5721 him 846 unto 1519 the other side 4008, while 2193 3739 he sent 630 0 the multitudes 3793 away 630 5661. 

14:23 And 2532 when he had sent 630 0 the multitudes 3793 away 630 5660, he went up 305 5627 into 1519 a mountain 3735 apart 2596 2398 to pray 4336 5664: and 1161 when the evening 3798 was come 1096 5637, he was 2258 5713 there 1563 alone 3441. 

14:24 But 1161 the ship 4143 was 2258 5713 now 2235 in the midst 3319 of the sea 2281, tossed 928 5746 with 5259 waves 2949: for 1063 the wind 417 was 2258 5713 contrary 1727. 

14:25 And 1161 in the fourth 5067 watch 5438 of the night 3571 Jesus 2424 went 565 5627 unto 4314 them 846, walking 4043 5723 on 1909 the sea 2281. 

14:26 And 2532 when the disciples 3101 saw 1492 5631 him 846 walking 4043 5723 on 1909 the sea 2281, they were troubled 5015 5681, saying 3004 5723 3754, It is 2076 5748 a spirit 5326; and 2532 they cried out 2896 5656 for 575 fear 5401. 

14:27 But 1161 straightway 2112 Jesus 2424 spake 2980 5656 unto them 846, saying 3004 5723, Be of good cheer 2293 5720; it is 1510 5748 I 1473; be 5399 0 not 3361 afraid 5399 5737. 

14:28 And 1161 Peter 4074 answered 611 5679 him 846 and said 2036 5627, Lord 2962, if 1487 it be 1488 5748 thou 4771, bid 2753 5657 me 3165 come 2064 5629 unto 4314 thee 4571 on 1909 the water 5204. 

14:29 And 1161 he said 2036 5627, Come 2064 5628. And 2532 when Peter 4074 was come down 2597 5631 out of 575 the ship 4143, he walked 4043 5656 on 1909 the water 5204, to go 2064 5629 to 4314 Jesus 2424. 

14:30 But 1161 when he saw 991 5723 the wind 417 boisterous 2478, he was afraid 5399 5675; and 2532 beginning 756 5671 to sink 2670 5745, he cried 2896 5656, saying 3004 5723, Lord 2962, save 4982 5657 me 3165. 

14:31 And 1161 immediately 2112 Jesus 2424 stretched forth 1614 5660 [his] hand 5495, and caught 1949 5633 him 846, and 2532 said 3004 5719 unto him 846, O thou of little faith 3640, wherefore 1519 5101 didst thou doubt 1365 5656? 

14:32 And 2532 when they 846 were come 1684 5631 into 1519 the ship 4143, the wind 417 ceased 2869 5656. 

14:33 Then 1161 they that were in 1722 the ship 4143 came 2064 5631 and worshipped 4352 5656 him 846, saying 3004 5723, Of a truth 230 thou art 1488 5748 the Son 5207 of God 2316. 

14:34 And 2532 when they were gone over 1276 5660, they came 2064 5627 into 1519 the land 1093 of Gennesaret 1082. 

14:35 And 2532 when the men 435 of that 1565 place 5117 had knowledge 1921 5631 of him 846, they sent out 649 5656 into 1519 all 3650 that 1565 country round about 4066, and 2532 brought 4374 5656 unto him 846 all 3956 that were 2192 5723 diseased 2560; 

14:36 And 2532 besought 3870 5707 him 846 that 2443 they might 680 0 only 3440 touch 680 5672 the hem 2899 of his garment 2440: and 2532 as many as 3745 touched 680 5662 were made perfectly whole 1295 5681. 

15:1 Then 5119 came 4334 5736 to Jesus 2424 scribes 1122 and 2532 Pharisees 5330, which were of 575 Jerusalem 2414, saying 3004 5723, 

15:2 Why 1302 do thy 4675 disciples 3101 transgress 3845 5719 the tradition 3862 of the elders 4245? for 1063 they wash 3538 5731 not 3756 their 848 hands 5495 when 3752 they eat 2068 5725 bread 740. 

15:3 But 1161 he answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Why 1302 do ye 5210 also 2532 transgress 3845 5719 the commandment 1785 of God 2316 by 1223 your 5216 tradition 3862? 

15:4 For 1063 God 2316 commanded 1781 5662, saying 3004 5723, Honour 5091 5720 thy 4675 father 3962 and 2532 mother 3384: and 2532, He that curseth 2551 5723 father 3962 or 2228 mother 3384, let him die 5053 5720 the death 2288. 

15:5 But 1161 ye 5210 say 3004 5719, Whosoever 3739 302 shall say 2036 5632 to [his] father 3962 or 2228 [his] mother 3384, [It is] a gift 1435, by 1537 whatsoever 3739 1437 thou mightest be profited 5623 5686 by me 1700; 

15:6 And 2532 honour 5091 5661 not 3364 his 848 father 3962 or 2228 his 848 mother 3384, [he shall be free]. Thus 2532 have ye made 208 0 the commandment 1785 of God 2316 of none effect 208 5656 by 1223 your 5216 tradition 3862. 

15:7 [Ye] hypocrites 5273, well 2573 did 4395 0 Esaias 2268 prophesy 4395 5656 of 4012 you 5216, saying 3004 5723, 

15:8 This 3778 people 2992 draweth nigh 1448 5719 unto me 3427 with their 848 mouth 4750, and 2532 honoureth 5091 5719 me 3165 with [their] lips 5491; but 1161 their 846 heart 2588 is 568 5719 far 4206 from 575 me 1700. 

15:9 But 1161 in vain 3155 they do worship 4576 5736 me 3165, teaching 1321 5723 [for] doctrines 1319 the commandments 1778 of men 444. 

15:10 And 2532 he called 4341 5666 the multitude 3793, and said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Hear 191 5720, and 2532 understand 4920 5720: 

15:11 Not 3756 that which goeth 1525 5740 into 1519 the mouth 4750 defileth 2840 5719 a man 444; but 235 that which cometh 1607 5740 out of 1537 the mouth 4750, this 5124 defileth 2840 5719 a man 444. 

15:12 Then 5119 came 4334 5631 his 846 disciples 3101, and said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Knowest thou 1492 5758 that 3754 the Pharisees 5330 were offended 4624 5681, after they heard 191 5660 this saying 3056? 

15:13 But 1161 he answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627, Every 3956 plant 5451, which 3739 my 3450 heavenly 3770 Father 3962 hath 5452 0 not 3756 planted 5452 5656, shall be rooted up 1610 5701. 

15:14 Let 863 0 them 846 alone 863 5628: they be 1526 5748 blind 5185 leaders 3595 of the blind 5185. And 1161 if 1437 the blind 5185 lead 3594 5725 the blind 5185, both 297 shall fall 4098 5699 into 1519 the ditch 999. 

15:15 Then 1161 answered 611 5679 Peter 4074 and said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Declare 5419 5657 unto us 2254 this 5026 parable 3850. 

15:16 And 1161 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627, Are 2075 5748 ye 5210 also 2532 yet 188 without understanding 801? 

15:17 Do 3539 0 not 3768 0 ye 3539 0 yet 3768 understand 3539 5719, that 3754 whatsoever 3956 entereth in 1531 5740 at 1519 the mouth 4750 goeth 5562 5719 into 1519 the belly 2836, and 2532 is cast out 1544 5743 into 1519 the draught 856? 

15:18 But 1161 those things which 3588 proceed 1607 5740 out of 1537 the mouth 4750 come forth 1831 5736 from 1537 the heart 2588; and they 2548 defile 2840 5719 the man 444. 

15:19 For 1063 out of 1537 the heart 2588 proceed 1831 5736 evil 4190 thoughts 1261, murders 5408, adulteries 3430, fornications 4202, thefts 2829, false witness 5577, blasphemies 988: 

15:20 These 5023 are 2076 5748 [the things] which 3588 defile 2840 5723 a man 444: but 1161 to eat 5315 5629 with unwashen 449 hands 5495 defileth 2840 5719 not 3756 a man 444. 

15:21 Then 2532 Jesus 2424 went 1831 5631 thence 1564, and departed 402 5656 into 1519 the coasts 3313 of Tyre 5184 and 2532 Sidon 4605. 

15:22 And 2532, behold 2400 5628, a woman 1135 of Canaan 5478 came 1831 5631 out of 575 the same 1565 coasts 3725, and cried 2905 5656 unto him 846, saying 3004 5723, Have mercy 1653 5657 on me 3165, O Lord 2962, [thou] Son 5207 of David 1138; my 3450 daughter 2364 is grievously 2560 vexed with a devil 1139 5736. 

15:23 But 1161 he answered 611 5662 her 846 not 3756 a word 3056. And 2532 his 846 disciples 3101 came 4334 5631 and besought 2065 5707 him 846, saying 3004 5723, Send 630 0 her 846 away 630 5657; for 3754 she crieth 2896 5719 after 3693 us 2257. 

15:24 But 1161 he answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627, I am 649 0 not 3756 sent 649 5648 but 1508 unto 1519 the lost 622 5756 sheep 4263 of the house 3624 of Israel 2474. 

15:25 Then 1161 came she 2064 5631 and worshipped 4352 5707 him 846, saying 3004 5723, Lord 2962, help 997 5720 me 3427. 

15:26 But 1161 he answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627, It is 2076 5748 not 3756 meet 2570 to take 2983 5629 the children's 5043 bread 740, and 2532 to cast 906 5629 [it] to dogs 2952. 

15:27 And 1161 she said 2036 5627, Truth 3483, Lord 2962: yet 2532 1063 the dogs 2952 eat 2068 5719 of 575 the crumbs 5589 which 3588 fall 4098 5723 from 575 their 848 masters 2962' table 5132. 

15:28 Then 5119 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627 unto her 846, O 5599 woman 1135, great 3173 [is] thy 4675 faith 4102: be it 1096 5676 unto thee 4671 even as 5613 thou wilt 2309 5719. And 2532 her 846 daughter 2364 was made whole 2390 5681 from 575 that very 1565 hour 5610. 

15:29 And 2532 Jesus 2424 departed 3327 5631 from thence 1564, and came 2064 5627 nigh unto 3844 the sea 2281 of Galilee 1056; and 2532 went up 305 5631 into 1519 a mountain 3735, and sat down 2521 5711 there 1563. 

15:30 And 2532 great 4183 multitudes 3793 came 4334 5656 unto him 846, having 2192 5723 with 3326 them [those that were] 1438 lame 5560, blind 5185, dumb 2974, maimed 2948, and 2532 many 4183 others 2087, and 2532 cast 4496 0 them 846 down 4496 5656 at 3844 Jesus 2424' feet 4228; and 2532 he healed 2323 5656 them 846: 

15:31 Insomuch that 5620 the multitude 3793 wondered 2296 5658, when they saw 991 5723 the dumb 2974 to speak 2980 5723, the maimed 2948 to be whole 5199, the lame 5560 to walk 4043 5723, and 2532 the blind 5185 to see 991 5723: and 2532 they glorified 1392 5656 the God 2316 of Israel 2474. 

15:32 Then 1161 Jesus 2424 called 4341 5666 his 848 disciples 3101 [unto him], and said 2036 5627, I have compassion 4697 5736 on 1909 the multitude 3793, because 3754 they continue 4357 5719 with me 3427 now 2235 three 5140 days 2250, and 2532 have 2192 5719 nothing 3756 5101 to eat 5315 5632: and 2532 I will 2309 5719 not 3756 send 630 0 them 846 away 630 5658 fasting 3523, lest 3379 they faint 1590 5686 in 1722 the way 3598. 

15:33 And 2532 his 846 disciples 3101 say 3004 5719 unto him 846, Whence 4159 should we 2254 have so much 5118 bread 740 in 1722 the wilderness 2047, as 5620 to fill 5526 5658 so great 5118 a multitude 3793? 

15:34 And 2532 Jesus 2424 saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, How many 4214 loaves 740 have ye 2192 5719? And 1161 they said 2036 5627, Seven 2033, and 2532 a few 3641 little fishes 2485. 

15:35 And 2532 he commanded 2753 5656 the multitude 3793 to sit down 377 5629 on 1909 the ground 1093. 

15:36 And 2532 he took 2983 5631 the seven 2033 loaves 740 and 2532 the fishes 2486, and gave thanks 2168 5660, and brake 2806 5656 [them], and 2532 gave 1325 5656 to his 848 disciples 3101, and 1161 the disciples 3101 to the multitude 3793. 

15:37 And 2532 they did 5315 0 all 3956 eat 5315 5627, and 2532 were filled 5526 5681: and 2532 they took up 142 5656 of the broken 2801 [meat] that was left 4052 5723 seven 2033 baskets 4711 full 4134. 

15:38 And 1161 they that did eat 2068 5723 were 2258 5713 four thousand 5070 men 435, beside 5565 women 1135 and 2532 children 3813. 

15:39 And 2532 he sent away 630 5660 the multitude 3793, and took 1684 5627 ship 1519 4143, and 2532 came 2064 5627 into 1519 the coasts 3725 of Magdala 3093. 

16:1 The Pharisees 5330 also 2532 with the Sadducees 4523 came 4334 5631, and 2532 tempting 3985 5723 desired 1905 5656 him 846 that he would shew 1925 5658 them 846 a sign 4592 from 1537 heaven 3772. 

16:2 1161 He answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627 unto them 846, When it is 1096 5637 evening 3798, ye say 3004 5719, [It will be] fair weather 2105: for 1063 the sky 3772 is red 4449 5719. 

16:3 And 2532 in the morning 4404, [It will be] foul weather 5494 to day 4594: for 1063 the sky 3772 is red 4449 5719 and lowring 4768 5723. O [ye] hypocrites 5273, ye can 1097 5719 discern 1252 5721 3303 the face 4383 of the sky 3772; but 1161 can ye 1410 5736 not 3756 [discern] the signs 4592 of the times 2540? 

16:4 A wicked 4190 and 2532 adulterous 3428 generation 1074 seeketh after 1934 5719 a sign 4592; and 2532 there shall no 3756 sign 4592 be given 1325 5701 unto it 846, but 1508 the sign 4592 of the prophet 4396 Jonas 2495. And 2532 he left 2641 5631 them 846, and departed 565 5627. 

16:5 And 2532 when his 846 disciples 3101 were come 2064 5631 to 1519 the other side 4008, they had forgotten 1950 5633 to take 2983 5629 bread 740. 

16:6 Then 1161 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Take heed 3708 5720 and 2532 beware 4337 5720 of 575 the leaven 2219 of the Pharisees 5330 and 2532 of the Sadducees 4523. 

16:7 And 1161 they reasoned 1260 5711 among 1722 themselves 1438, saying 3004 5723, [It is] because 3754 we have taken 2983 5627 no 3756 bread 740. 

16:8 [Which] when 1161 Jesus 2424 perceived 1097 5631, he said 2036 5627 unto them 846, O ye of little faith 3640, why 5101 reason ye 1260 5736 among 1722 yourselves 1438, because 3754 ye have brought 2983 5627 no 3756 bread 740? 

16:9 Do ye 3539 0 not yet 3768 understand 3539 5719, neither 3761 remember 3421 5719 the five 4002 loaves 740 of the five thousand 4000, and 2532 how many 4214 baskets 2894 ye took up 2983 5627? 

16:10 Neither 3761 the seven 2033 loaves 740 of the four thousand 5070, and 2532 how many 4214 baskets 4711 ye took up 2983 5627? 

16:11 How 4459 is it that 3754 ye do 3539 0 not 3756 understand 3539 5719 that I spake 2036 5627 [it] not 3756 to you 5213 concerning 4012 bread 740, that ye should beware 4337 5721 of 575 the leaven 2219 of the Pharisees 5330 and 2532 of the Sadducees 4523? 

16:12 Then 5119 understood they 4920 5656 how that 3754 he bade 2036 5627 [them] not 3756 beware 4337 5721 of 575 the leaven 2219 of bread 740, but 235 of 575 the doctrine 1322 of the Pharisees 5330 and 2532 of the Sadducees 4523. 

16:13 When 1161 Jesus 2424 came 2064 5631 into 1519 the coasts 3313 of Caesarea 2542 Philippi 5376, he asked 2065 5707 his 848 disciples 3101, saying 3004 5723, Whom 5101 do men 444 say 3004 5719 that I 3165 the Son 5207 of man 444 am 1511 5750? 

16:14 And 1161 they said 2036 5627, Some [say that thou art] 3303 John 2491 the Baptist 910: 1161 some 243, Elias 2243; and 1161 others 2087, Jeremias 2408, or 2228 one 1520 of the prophets 4396. 

16:15 He saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, But 1161 whom 5101 say 3004 5719 ye 5210 that I 3165 am 1511 5750? 

16:16 And 1161 Simon 4613 Peter 4074 answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627, Thou 4771 art 1488 5748 the Christ 5547, the Son 5207 of the living 2198 5723 God 2316. 

16:17 And 2532 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Blessed 3107 art thou 1488 5748, Simon 4613 Barjona 920: for 3754 flesh 4561 and 2532 blood 129 hath 601 0 not 3756 revealed 601 5656 [it] unto thee 4671, but 235 my 3450 Father 3962 which 3588 is in 1722 heaven 3772. 

16:18 And 1161 I say 3004 5719 also 2504 unto thee 4671, That 3754 thou 4771 art 1488 5748 Peter 4074, and 2532 upon 1909 this 5026 rock 4073 I will build 3618 5692 my 3450 church 1577; and 2532 the gates 4439 of hell 86 shall 2729 0 not 3756 prevail against 2729 5692 it 846. 

16:19 And 2532 I will give 1325 5692 unto thee 4671 the keys 2807 of the kingdom 932 of heaven 3772: and 2532 whatsoever 1437 thou shalt bind 1210 5661 on 1909 earth 1093 shall be 2071 5704 bound 1210 5772 in 1722 heaven 3772: and 2532 whatsoever 1437 thou shalt loose 3089 5661 on 1909 earth 1093 shall be 2071 5704 loosed 3089 5772 in 1722 heaven 3772. 

16:20 Then 5119 charged he 1291 5668 his 848 disciples 3101 that 2443 they should tell 2036 5632 no man 3367 that 3754 he 846 was 2076 5748 Jesus 2424 the Christ 5547. 

16:21 From 575 that time forth 5119 began 756 5662 Jesus 2424 to shew 1166 5721 unto his 848 disciples 3101, how that 3754 he 846 must 1163 5748 go 565 5629 unto 1519 Jerusalem 2414, and 2532 suffer 3958 5629 many things 4183 of 575 the elders 4245 and 2532 chief priests 749 and 2532 scribes 1122, and 2532 be killed 615 5683, and 2532 be raised again 1453 5683 the third 5154 day 2250. 

16:22 Then 2532 Peter 4074 took 4355 5642 him 846, and began 756 5662 to rebuke 2008 5721 him 846, saying 3004 5723, Be it far 2436 from thee 4671, Lord 2962: this 5124 shall 2071 0 not 3364 be 2071 5704 unto thee 4671. 

16:23 But 1161 he turned 4762 5651, and said 2036 5627 unto Peter 4074, Get thee 5217 5720 behind 3694 me 3450, Satan 4567: thou 1488 5748 art 3754 an offence 4625 unto me 3450: for thou savourest 5426 5719 not 3756 the things 3588 that be of God 2316, but 235 those that be of men 444. 

16:24 Then 5119 said 2036 5627 Jesus 2424 unto his 848 disciples 3101, If any 1536 [man] will 2309 5719 come 2064 5629 after 3694 me 3450, let him deny 533 5663 himself 1438, and 2532 take up 142 5657 his 848 cross 4716, and 2532 follow 190 5720 me 3427. 

16:25 For 1063 whosoever 3739 302 will 2309 5725 save 4982 5658 his 848 life 5590 shall lose 622 5692 it 846: and 1161 whosoever 3739 302 will lose 622 5661 his 848 life 5590 for 1752 0 my 1700 sake 1752 shall find 2147 5692 it 846. 

16:26 For 1063 what 5101 is a man 444 profited 5623 5743, if 1437 he shall gain 2770 5661 the whole 3650 world 2889, and 1161 lose 2210 5686 his own 848 soul 5590? or 2228 what 5101 shall a man 444 give 1325 5692 in exchange 465 for his 848 soul 5590? 

16:27 For 1063 the Son 5207 of man 444 shall 3195 5719 come 2064 5738 in 1722 the glory 1391 of his 848 Father 3962 with 3326 his 846 angels 32; and 2532 then 5119 he shall reward 591 5692 every man 1538 according 2596 to his 846 works 4234. 

16:28 Verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, There be 1526 5748 some 5100 standing 2476 5761 here 5602, which 3748 shall 1089 0 not 3364 taste 1089 5667 of death 2288, till 302 2193 they see 1492 5632 the Son 5207 of man 444 coming 2064 5740 in 1722 his 848 kingdom 932. 

17:1 And 2532 after 3326 six 1803 days 2250 Jesus 2424 taketh 3880 5719 Peter 4074 2532, James 2385, and 2532 John 2491 his 846 brother 80, and 2532 bringeth 399 0 them 846 up 399 5719 into 1519 an high 5308 mountain 3735 apart 2596 2398, 

17:2 And 2532 was transfigured 3339 5681 before 1715 them 846: and 2532 his 846 face 4383 did shine 2989 5656 as 5613 the sun 2246, and 1161 his 846 raiment 2440 was 1096 5633 white 3022 as 5613 the light 5457. 

17:3 And 2532, behold 2400 5628, there appeared 3700 5681 unto them 846 Moses 3475 and 2532 Elias 2243 talking 4814 5723 with 3326 him 846. 

17:4 Then 1161 answered 611 5679 Peter 4074, and said 2036 5627 unto Jesus 2424, Lord 2962, it is 2076 5748 good 2570 for us 2248 to be 1511 5750 here 5602: if 1487 thou wilt 2309 5719, let us make 4160 5661 here 5602 three 5140 tabernacles 4633; one 3391 for thee 4671, and 2532 one 3391 for Moses 3475, and 2532 one 3391 for Elias 2243. 

17:5 While he 846 yet 2089 spake 2980 5723, behold 2400 5628, a bright 5460 cloud 3507 overshadowed 1982 5656 them 846: and 2532 behold 2400 5628 a voice 5456 out of 1537 the cloud 3507, which said 3004 5723, This 3778 is 2076 5748 my 3450 beloved 27 Son 5207, in 1722 whom 3739 I am well pleased 2106 5656; hear ye 191 5720 him 846. 

17:6 And 2532 when the disciples 3101 heard 191 5660 [it], they fell 4098 5627 on 1909 their 848 face 4383, and 2532 were sore 4970 afraid 5399 5675. 

17:7 And 2532 Jesus 2424 came 4334 5631 and 2532 touched 680 5662 them 846, and 2532 said 2036 5627, Arise 1453 5682, and 2532 be 5399 0 not 3361 afraid 5399 5737. 

17:8 And 1161 when they had lifted up 1869 5660 their 848 eyes 3788, they saw 1492 5627 no man 3762, save 1508 Jesus 2424 only 3441. 

17:9 And 2532 as they came down 2597 5723 from 575 the mountain 3735, Jesus 2424 charged 1781 5662 them 846, saying 3004 5723, Tell 2036 5632 the vision 3705 to no man 3367, until 2193 3739 the Son 5207 of man 444 be risen again 450 5632 from 1537 the dead 3498. 

17:10 And 2532 his 846 disciples 3101 asked 1905 5656 him 846, saying 3004 5723, Why 5101 then 3767 say 3004 5719 the scribes 1122 that 3754 Elias 2243 must 1163 5748 first 4412 come 2064 5629? 

17:11 And 1161 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Elias 2243 truly 3303 shall first 4412 come 2064 5736, and 2532 restore 600 5692 all things 3956. 

17:12 But 1161 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, That 3754 Elias 2243 is come 2064 5627 already 2235, and 2532 they knew 1921 5627 him 846 not 3756, but 235 have done 4160 5656 unto 1722 him 846 whatsoever 3745 they listed 2309 5656. Likewise 3779 shall 3195 5719 also 2532 the Son 5207 of man 444 suffer 3958 5721 of 5259 them 846. 

17:13 Then 5119 the disciples 3101 understood 4920 5656 that 3754 he spake 2036 5627 unto them 846 of 4012 John 2491 the Baptist 910. 

17:14 And 2532 when they were come 2064 5631 to 4314 the multitude 3793, there came 4334 5627 to him 846 a [certain] man 444, kneeling down 1120 5723 to him 846, and 2532 saying 3004 5723, 

17:15 Lord 2962, have mercy 1653 5657 on my 3450 son 5207: for 3754 he is lunatick 4583 5736, and 2532 sore 2560 vexed 3958 5719: for 1063 ofttimes 4178 he falleth 4098 5719 into 1519 the fire 4442, and 2532 oft 4178 into 1519 the water 5204. 

17:16 And 2532 I brought 4374 5656 him 846 to thy 4675 disciples 3101, and 2532 they could 1410 5675 not 3756 cure 2323 5658 him 846. 

17:17 Then 1161 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627, O 5599 faithless 571 and 2532 perverse 1294 5772 generation 1074, how long 2193 4219 shall I be 2071 5704 with 3326 you 5216? how long 2193 4219 shall I suffer 430 5695 you 5216? bring 5342 5720 him 846 hither 5602 to me 3427. 

17:18 And 2532 Jesus 2424 rebuked 2008 5656 the devil 1140; and 2532 he departed 1831 5627 out of 575 him 846: and 2532 the child 3816 was cured 2323 5681 from 575 that very 1565 hour 5610. 

17:19 Then 5119 came 4334 5631 the disciples 3101 to Jesus 2424 apart 2596 2398, and said 2036 5627, Why 1302 could 1410 5675 not 3756 we 2249 cast 1544 0 him 846 out 1544 5629? 

17:20 And 1161 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Because 1223 of your 5216 unbelief 570: for 1063 verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, If 1437 ye have 2192 5725 faith 4102 as 5613 a grain 2848 of mustard seed 4615, ye shall say 2046 5692 unto this 5129 mountain 3735, Remove 3327 5628 hence 1782 to yonder place 1563; and 2532 it shall remove 3327 5695; and 2532 nothing 3762 shall be impossible 101 5692 unto you 5213. 

17:21 Howbeit 1161 this 5124 kind 1085 goeth 1607 0 not 3756 out 1607 5736 but 1508 by 1722 prayer 4335 and 2532 fasting 3521. 

17:22 And 1161 while they 846 abode 390 5746 in 1722 Galilee 1056, Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, The Son 5207 of man 444 shall be 3195 5719 betrayed 3860 5745 into 1519 the hands 5495 of men 444: 

17:23 And 2532 they shall kill 615 5692 him 846, and 2532 the third 5154 day 2250 he shall be raised again 1453 5701. And 2532 they were exceeding 4970 sorry 3076 5681. 

17:24 And 1161 when they 846 were come 2064 5631 to 1519 Capernaum 2584, they that received 2983 5723 tribute 1323 [money] came 4334 5656 to Peter 4074, and 2532 said 2036 5627, Doth 5055 0 not 3756 your 5216 master 1320 pay 5055 5719 tribute 1323? 

17:25 He saith 3004 5719, Yes 3483. And 2532 when 3753 he was come 1525 5627 into 1519 the house 3614, Jesus 2424 prevented 4399 5656 him 846, saying 3004 5723, What 5101 thinkest 1380 5719 thou 4671, Simon 4613? of 575 whom 5101 do 2983 0 the kings 935 of the earth 1093 take 2983 5719 custom 5056 or 2228 tribute 2778? of 575 their own 848 children 5207, or 2228 of 575 strangers 245? 

17:26 Peter 4074 saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, Of 575 strangers 245. Jesus 2424 saith 5346 5713 unto him 846, Then 686 are 1526 5748 the children 5207 free 1658. 

17:27 Notwithstanding 1161, lest 3363 we should offend 4624 5661 them 846, go thou 4198 5679 to 1519 the sea 2281, and 2532 cast 906 5628 an hook 44, and 2532 take up 142 5657 the fish 2486 that first 4413 cometh up 305 5631; and 2532 when thou hast opened 455 5660 his 846 mouth 4750, thou shalt find 2147 5692 a piece of money 4715: that 1565 take 2983 5631, and give 1325 5628 unto them 846 for 473 me 1700 and 2532 thee 4675. 

18:1 At 1722 the same 1565 time 5610 came 4334 5656 the disciples 3101 unto Jesus 2424, saying 3004 5723, Who 5101 686 is 2076 5748 the greatest 3187 in 1722 the kingdom 932 of heaven 3772? 

18:2 And 2532 Jesus 2424 called 4341 0 a little child 3813 unto him 4341 5666, and set 2476 5656 him 846 in 1722 the midst 3319 of them 846, 

18:3 And 2532 said 2036 5627, Verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, Except 3362 ye be converted 4762 5652, and 2532 become 1096 5638 as 5613 little children 3813, ye shall 1525 0 not 3364 enter 1525 5632 into 1519 the kingdom 932 of heaven 3772. 

18:4 Whosoever 3748 therefore 3767 shall humble 5013 5661 himself 1438 as 5613 this 5124 little child 3813, the same 3778 is 2076 5748 greatest 3187 in 1722 the kingdom 932 of heaven 3772. 

18:5 And 2532 whoso 3739 1437 shall receive 1209 5667 one 1520 such 5108 little child 3813 in 1909 my 3450 name 3686 receiveth 1209 5736 me 1691. 

18:6 But 1161 whoso 3739 302 shall offend 4624 5661 one 1520 of these 5130 little ones 3398 which 3588 believe 4100 5723 in 1519 me 1691, it were better 4851 5719 for him 846 that 2443 a millstone 3458 3684 were hanged 2910 5686 about 1909 his 846 neck 5137, and 2532 [that] he were drowned 2670 5686 in 1722 the depth 3989 of the sea 2281. 

18:7 Woe 3759 unto the world 2889 because of 575 offences 4625! for 1063 it must needs 318 be 2076 5748 that offences 4625 come 2064 5629; but 4133 woe 3759 to that man 444 by 1565 whom 1223 3739 the offence 4625 cometh 2064 5736! 

18:8 Wherefore 1161 if 1487 thy 4675 hand 5495 or 2228 thy 4675 foot 4228 offend thee 4624 5719, cut 1581 0 them 846 off 1581 5657, and 2532 cast 906 5628 [them] from 575 thee 4571 4675: it is 2076 5748 better 2570 for thee 4671 to enter into 1525 5629 1519 life 2222 halt 5560 or 2228 maimed 2948, rather than 2228 having 2192 5723 two 1417 hands 5495 or 2228 two 1417 feet 4228 to be cast 906 5683 into 1519 everlasting 166 fire 4442. 

18:9 And 2532 if 1487 thine 4675 eye 3788 offend 4624 5719 thee 4571, pluck 1807 0 it 846 out 1807 5628, and 2532 cast 906 5628 [it] from 575 thee 4675: it is 2076 5748 better 2570 for thee 4671 to enter 1525 5629 into 1519 life 2222 with one eye 3442, rather than 2228 having 2192 5723 two 1417 eyes 3788 to be cast 906 5683 into 1519 hell 1067 fire 4442. 

18:10 Take heed 3708 5720 that ye despise 2706 5661 not 3361 one 1520 of these 5130 little ones 3398; for 1063 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, That 3754 in 1722 heaven 3772 their 846 angels 32 do always 1223 3956 behold 991 5719 the face 4383 of my 3450 Father 3962 which 3588 is in 1722 heaven 3772. 

18:11 For 1063 the Son 5207 of man 444 is come 2064 5627 to save 4982 5658 that which 3588 was lost 622 5756. 

18:12 How 5101 think 1380 5719 ye 5213? if 1437 5100 a man 444 have 1096 5638 an hundred 1540 sheep 4263, and 2532 one 1520 of 1537 them 846 be gone astray 4105 5686, doth he 863 0 not 3780 leave 863 5631 the ninety and nine 1768, and goeth 4198 5679 into 1909 the mountains 3735, and seeketh 2212 5719 that which 3588 is gone astray 4105 5746? 

18:13 And 2532 if so 1437 be 1096 5638 that he find 2147 5629 it 846, verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213 3754, he rejoiceth 5463 5719 more 3123 of 1909 that 846 [sheep], than 2228 of 1909 the ninety and nine 1768 which 3588 went 4105 0 not 3361 astray 4105 5772. 

18:14 Even so 3779 it is 2076 5748 not 3756 the will 2307 of 1715 your 5216 Father 3962 which 3588 is in 1722 heaven 3772, that 2443 one 1520 of these 5130 little ones 3398 should perish 622 5643. 

18:15 Moreover 1161 if 1437 thy 4675 brother 80 shall trespass 264 5661 against 1519 thee 4571, go 5217 5720 and 2532 tell 1651 0 him 846 his fault 1651 5657 between 3342 thee 4675 and 2532 him 846 alone 3441: if 1437 he shall hear 191 5661 thee 4675, thou hast gained 2770 5656 thy 4675 brother 80. 

18:16 But 1161 if 3362 0 he will 191 0 not 3362 hear 191 5661 [thee, then] take 3880 5628 with 3326 thee 4675 one 1520 or 2228 two 1417 more 2089, that 2443 in 1909 the mouth 4750 of two 1417 or 2228 three 5140 witnesses 3144 every 3956 word 4487 may be established 2476 5686. 

18:17 And 1161 if 1437 he shall neglect to hear 3878 5661 them 846, tell 2036 5628 [it] unto the church 1577: but 1161 2532 if 1437 he neglect to hear 3878 5661 the church 1577, let him be 2077 5749 unto thee 4671 as 5618 an heathen man 1482 and 2532 a publican 5057. 

18:18 Verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, Whatsoever 3745 1437 ye shall bind 1210 5661 on 1909 earth 1093 shall be 2071 5704 bound 1210 5772 in 1722 heaven 3772: and 2532 whatsoever 3745 1437 ye shall loose 3089 5661 on 1909 earth 1093 shall be 2071 5704 loosed 3089 5772 in 1722 heaven 3772. 

18:19 Again 3825 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, That 3754 if 1437 two 1417 of you 5216 shall agree 4856 5661 on 1909 earth 1093 as touching 4012 any 3956 thing 4229 that 1437 they shall ask 154 5672, it shall be done 1096 5695 for them 846 of 3844 my 3450 Father 3962 which 3588 is in 1722 heaven 3772. 

18:20 For 1063 where 3757 two 1417 or 2228 three 5140 are 1526 5748 gathered together 4863 5772 in 1519 my 1699 name 3686, there 1563 am I 1510 5748 in 1722 the midst 3319 of them 846. 

18:21 Then 5119 came 4334 5631 Peter 4074 to him 846, and said 2036 5627, Lord 2962, how oft 4212 shall my 3450 brother 80 sin 264 5692 against 1519 me 1691, and 2532 I forgive 863 5692 him 846? till 2193 seven times 2034? 

18:22 Jesus 2424 saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, I say 3004 5719 not 3756 unto thee 4671, Until 2193 seven times 2034: but 235, Until 2193 seventy times 1441 seven 2033. 

18:23 Therefore 1223 5124 is the kingdom 932 of heaven 3772 likened 3666 5681 unto a certain 444 king 935, which 3739 would 2309 5656 take 4868 5658 account 3056 of 3326 his 848 servants 1401. 

18:24 And 1161 when he 846 had begun 756 5671 to reckon 4868 5721, one 1520 was brought 4374 5681 unto him 846, which owed 3781 him 846 ten thousand 3463 talents 5007. 

18:25 But forasmuch as 1161 he had 2192 5723 not 3361 to pay 591 5629, his 846 lord 2962 commanded 2753 5656 him 846 to be sold 4097 5683, and 2532 his 846 wife 1135, and 2532 children 5043, and 2532 all 3956 that 3745 he had 2192 5707, and 2532 payment to be made 591 5683. 

18:26 The servant 1401 therefore 3767 fell down 4098 5631, and worshipped 4352 5707 him 846, saying 3004 5723, Lord 2962, have patience 3114 5657 with 1909 me 1698, and 2532 I will pay 591 5692 thee 4671 all 3956. 

18:27 Then 1161 the lord 2962 of that 1565 servant 1401 was moved with compassion 4697 5679, and 2532 loosed 630 5656 him, and 2532 forgave 863 5656 him 846 the debt 1156. 

18:28 But 1161 the same 1565 servant 1401 went out 1831 5631, and found 2147 5627 one 1520 of his 848 fellowservants 4889, which 3739 owed 3784 5707 him 846 an hundred 1540 pence 1220: and 2532 he laid hands 2902 5660 on him 846, and took 846 [him] by the throat 4155 5707, saying 3004 5723, Pay 591 5628 me 3427 that 3748 thou owest 3784 5719. 

18:29 And 3767 his 846 fellowservant 4889 fell down 4098 5631 at 1519 his 846 feet 4228, and besought 3870 5707 him 846, saying 3004 5723, Have patience 3114 5657 with 1909 me 1698, and 2532 I will pay 591 5692 thee 4671 all 3956. 

18:30 And 1161 he would 2309 5707 not 3756: but 235 went 565 5631 and cast 906 5627 him 846 into 1519 prison 5438, till 2193 he should pay 591 5632 the debt 3784 5746. 

18:31 So 1161 when his 846 fellowservants 4889 saw 1492 5631 what was done 1096 5637, they were very 4970 sorry 3076 5681, and 2532 came 2064 5631 and told 1285 5656 unto their 848 lord 2962 all 3956 that was done 1096 5637. 

18:32 Then 5119 his 846 lord 2962, after that he had called 4341 5666 him 846, said 3004 5719 unto him 846, O thou wicked 4190 servant 1401, I forgave 863 5656 thee 4671 all 3956 that 1565 debt 3782, because 1893 thou desiredst 3870 5656 me 3165: 

18:33 Shouldest 1163 5713 not 3756 thou 4571 also 2532 have had compassion 1653 5658 on thy 4675 fellowservant 4889, even 2532 as 5613 I 1473 had pity 1653 5656 on thee 4571? 

18:34 And 2532 his 846 lord 2962 was wroth 3710 5685, and delivered 3860 5656 him 846 to the tormentors 930, till 2193 he should pay 591 5632 all 3956 that was due 3784 5746 unto him 846. 

18:35 So 3779 likewise shall my 3450 heavenly 2032 Father 3962 do 4160 5692 also 2532 unto you 5213, if 3362 0 ye from 575 your 5216 hearts 2588 forgive 863 5632 not 3362 every one 1538 his 848 brother 80 their 846 trespasses 3900. 

19:1 And 2532 it came to pass 1096 5633, [that] when 3753 Jesus 2424 had finished 5055 5656 these 5128 sayings 3056, he departed 3332 5656 from 575 Galilee 1056, and 2532 came 2064 5627 into 1519 the coasts 3725 of Judaea 2449 beyond 4008 Jordan 2446; 

19:2 And 2532 great 4183 multitudes 3793 followed 190 5656 him 846; and 2532 he healed 2323 5656 them 846 there 1563. 

19:3 The Pharisees 5330 also 2532 came 4334 5656 unto him 846, tempting 3985 5723 him 846, and 2532 saying 3004 5723 unto him 846, Is it lawful 1487 1832 5748 for a man 444 to put away 630 5658 his 848 wife 1135 for 2596 every 3956 cause 156? 

19:4 And 1161 he answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Have ye 314 0 not 3756 read 314 5627, that 3754 he which 3588 made 4160 5660 [them] at 575 the beginning 746 made 4160 5656 them 846 male 730 and 2532 female 2338, 

19:5 And 2532 said 2036 5627, For this 5127 cause 1752 shall a man 444 leave 2641 5692 father 3962 and 2532 mother 3384, and 2532 shall cleave 4347 5701 to his 848 wife 1135: and 2532 they twain 1417 shall be 2071 5704 1519 one 3391 flesh 4561? 

19:6 Wherefore 5620 they are 1526 5748 no more 3765 twain 1417, but 235 one 3391 flesh 4561. What 3739 therefore 3767 God 2316 hath joined together 4801 5656, let 5563 0 not 3361 man 444 put asunder 5563 5720. 

19:7 They say 3004 5719 unto him 846, Why 5101 did Moses 3475 then 3767 command 1781 5662 to give 1325 5629 a writing 975 of divorcement 647, and 2532 to put 630 0 her 846 away 630 5658? 

19:8 He saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, 3754 Moses 3475 because of 4314 the hardness 4641 0 of your 5216 hearts 4641 suffered 2010 5656 you 5213 to put away 630 5658 your 5216 wives 1135: but 1161 from 575 the beginning 746 it was 1096 5754 not 3756 so 3779. 

19:9 And 1161 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, 3754 Whosoever 3739 302 shall put away 630 5661 his 848 wife 1135, except 1508 [it be] for 1909 fornication 4202, and 2532 shall marry 1060 5661 another 243, committeth adultery 3429 5736: and 2532 whoso marrieth 1060 5660 her which 3588 is put away 630 5772 doth commit adultery 3429 5736. 

19:10 His 846 disciples 3101 say 3004 5719 unto him 846, If 1487 the case 156 of the man 444 be 2076 5748 so 3779 with 3326 [his] wife 1135, it is 4851 0 not 3756 good 4851 5719 to marry 1060 5658. 

19:11 But 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto them 846, All 3956 [men] cannot 3756 receive 5562 5719 this 5126 saying 3056, save 235 [they] to whom 3739 it is given 1325 5769. 

19:12 For 1063 there are 1526 5748 some eunuchs 2135, which 3748 were so 3779 born 1080 5681 from 1537 [their] mother's 3384 womb 2836: and 2532 there are 1526 5748 some eunuchs 2135, which 3748 were made eunuchs 2134 5656 of 5259 men 444: and 2532 there be 1526 5748 eunuchs 2135, which 3748 have made 2134 0 themselves 1438 eunuchs 2134 5656 for 1223 the kingdom 932 of heaven's sake 3772. He that is able 1410 5740 to receive 5562 5721 [it], let him receive 5562 5720 [it]. 

19:13 Then 5119 were there brought 4374 5681 unto him 846 little children 3813, that 2443 he should put 2007 0 [his] hands 5495 on 2007 5632 them 846, and 2532 pray 4336 5667: and 1161 the disciples 3101 rebuked 2008 5656 them 846. 

19:14 But 1161 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627, Suffer 863 5628 little children 3813, and 2532 forbid 2967 5720 them 846 not 3361, to come 2064 5629 unto 4314 me 3165: for 1063 of such 5108 is 2076 5748 the kingdom 932 of heaven 3772. 

19:15 And 2532 he laid 2007 0 [his] hands 5495 on 2007 5631 them 846, and departed 4198 5675 thence 1564. 

19:16 And 2532, behold 2400 5628, one 1520 came 4334 5631 and said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Good 18 Master 1320, what 5101 good thing 18 shall I do 4160 5661, that 2443 I may have 2192 5725 eternal 166 life 2416? 

19:17 And 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Why 5101 callest thou 3004 5719 me 3165 good 18? [there is] none 3762 good 18 but 1508 one 1520, [that is], God 2316: but 1161 if 1487 thou wilt 2309 5719 enter 1525 5629 into 1519 life 2222, keep 5083 5657 the commandments 1785. 

19:18 He saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, Which 4169? 1161 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627, Thou shalt do 5407 0 no 3756 murder 5407 5692, Thou shalt 3431 0 not 3756 commit adultery 3431 5692, Thou shalt 2813 0 not 3756 steal 2813 5692, Thou shalt 5576 0 not 3756 bear false witness 5576 5692, 

19:19 Honour 5091 5720 thy 4675 father 3962 and 2532 [thy] mother 3384: and 2532, Thou shalt love 25 5692 thy 4675 neighbour 4139 as 5613 thyself 4572. 

19:20 The young man 3495 saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, All 3956 these things 5023 have I kept 5442 5668 from 1537 my 3450 youth up 3503: what 5101 lack 5302 5719 I yet 2089? 

19:21 Jesus 2424 said 5346 5713 unto him 846, If 1487 thou wilt 2309 5719 be 1511 5750 perfect 5046, go 5217 5720 [and] sell 4453 5657 that thou 4675 hast 5224 5723, and 2532 give 1325 5628 to the poor 4434, and 2532 thou shalt have 2192 5692 treasure 2344 in 1722 heaven 3772: and 2532 come 1204 5773 [and] follow 190 5720 me 3427. 

19:22 But 1161 when the young man 3495 heard 191 5660 that saying 3056, he went away 565 5627 sorrowful 3076 5746: for 1063 he had 2192 5723 2258 5713 great 4183 possessions 2933. 

19:23 Then 1161 said 2036 5627 Jesus 2424 unto his 848 disciples 3101, Verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, That 3754 a rich man 4145 shall hardly 1423 enter 1525 5695 into 1519 the kingdom 932 of heaven 3772. 

19:24 And 1161 again 3825 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, It is 2076 5748 easier 2123 for a camel 2574 to go 1330 5629 through 1223 the eye 5169 of a needle 4476, than 2228 for a rich man 4145 to enter 1525 5629 into 1519 the kingdom 932 of God 2316. 

19:25 When 1161 his 846 disciples 3101 heard 191 5660 [it], they were exceedingly 4970 amazed 1605 5712, saying 3004 5723, Who 5101 then 686 can 1410 5736 be saved 4982 5683? 

19:26 But 1161 Jesus 2424 beheld 1689 5660 [them], and said 2036 5627 unto them 846, With 3844 men 444 this 5124 is 2076 5748 impossible 102; but 1161 with 3844 God 2316 all things 3956 are 2076 5748 possible 1415. 

19:27 Then 5119 answered 611 5679 Peter 4074 and said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Behold 2400 5628, we 2249 have forsaken 863 5656 all 3956, and 2532 followed 190 5656 thee 4671; what 5101 shall we 2254 have 2071 5704 therefore 686? 

19:28 And 1161 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, That 3754 ye 5210 which 3588 have followed 190 5660 me 3427, in 1722 the regeneration 3824 when 3752 the Son 5207 of man 444 shall sit 2523 5661 in 1909 the throne 2362 of his 848 glory 1391, ye 5210 also 2532 shall sit 2523 5695 upon 1909 twelve 1427 thrones 2362, judging 2919 5723 the twelve 1427 tribes 5443 of Israel 2474. 

19:29 And 2532 every 3956 one 3739 that hath forsaken 863 5656 houses 3614, or 2228 brethren 80, or 2228 sisters 79, or 2228 father 3962, or 2228 mother 3384, or 2228 wife 1135, or 2228 children 5043, or 2228 lands 68, for my 3450 name's 3686 sake 1752, shall receive 2983 5695 an hundredfold 1542, and 2532 shall inherit 2816 5692 everlasting 166 life 2222. 

19:30 But 1161 many 4183 [that are] first 4413 shall be 2071 5704 last 2078; and 2532 the last 2078 [shall be] first 4413. 

20:1 For 1063 the kingdom 932 of heaven 3772 is 2076 5748 like 3664 unto a man 444 [that is] an householder 3617, which 3748 went out 1831 5627 early in the morning 260 4404 to hire 3409 5670 labourers 2040 into 1519 his 848 vineyard 290. 

20:2 And 1161 when he had agreed 4856 5660 with 3326 the labourers 2040 for 1537 a penny 1220 a day 2250, he sent 649 5656 them 846 into 1519 his 848 vineyard 290. 

20:3 And 2532 he went out 1831 5631 about 4012 the third 5154 hour 5610, and saw 1492 5627 others 243 standing 2476 5761 idle 692 in 1722 the marketplace 58, 

20:4 And said 2036 5627 unto them 2548; Go 5217 5720 ye 5210 also 2532 into 1519 the vineyard 290, and 2532 whatsoever 1437 is 5600 5753 right 1342 I will give 1325 5692 you 5213. And 1161 they went their way 565 5627. 

20:5 Again 3825 he went out 1831 5631 about 4012 the sixth 1623 and 2532 ninth 1766 hour 5610, and did 4160 5656 likewise 5615. 

20:6 And 1161 about 4012 the eleventh 1734 hour 5610 he went out 1831 5631, and found 2147 5627 others 243 standing 2476 5761 idle 692, and 2532 saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Why 5101 stand ye 2476 5758 here 5602 all 3650 the day 2250 idle 692? 

20:7 They say 3004 5719 unto him 846, Because 3754 no man 3762 hath hired 3409 5668 us 2248. He saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Go 5217 5720 ye 5210 also 2532 into 1519 the vineyard 290; and 2532 whatsoever 1437 is 5600 5753 right 1342, [that] shall ye receive 2983 5695. 

20:8 So 1161 when even 3798 was come 1096 5637, the lord 2962 of the vineyard 290 saith 3004 5719 unto his 848 steward 2012, Call 2564 5657 the labourers 2040, and 2532 give 591 5628 them 846 [their] hire 3408, beginning 756 5671 from 575 the last 2078 unto 2193 the first 4413. 

20:9 And 2532 when they came 2064 5631 that [were hired] about 4012 the eleventh 1734 hour 5610, they received 2983 5627 every man 303 a penny 1220. 

20:10 But 1161 when the first 4413 came 2064 5631, they supposed 3543 5656 that 3754 they should have received 2983 5695 more 4119; and 2532 they likewise 2532 received 2983 5627 every man 303 a penny 1220. 

20:11 And 1161 when they had received 2983 5631 [it], they murmured 1111 5707 against 2596 the goodman of the house 3617, 

20:12 3754 Saying 3004 5723, These 3778 last 2078 have wrought 4160 5656 [but] one 3391 hour 5610, and 2532 thou hast made 4160 5656 them 846 equal 2470 unto us 2254, which 3588 have borne 941 5660 the burden 922 and 2532 heat 2742 of the day 2250. 

20:13 But 1161 he answered 611 5679 one 1520 of them 846, and said 2036 5627, Friend 2083, I do 91 0 thee 4571 no 3756 wrong 91 5719: didst 4856 0 not 3780 thou agree 4856 5656 with me 3427 for a penny 1220? 

20:14 Take 142 5657 [that] thine 4674 [is], and 2532 go thy way 5217 5720: 1161 I will 2309 5719 give 1325 5629 unto this 5129 last 2078, even 2532 as 5613 unto thee 4671. 

20:15 2228 Is it not 3756 lawful 1832 5748 for me 3427 to do 4160 5658 what 3739 I will 2309 5719 5725 with 1722 mine own 1699? 2228 Is 2076 5748 thine 4675 eye 3788 evil 4190, because 3754 I 1473 am 1510 5748 good 18? 

20:16 So 3779 the last 2078 shall be 2071 5704 first 4413, and 2532 the first 4413 last 2078: for 1063 many 4183 be 1526 5748 called 2822, but 1161 few 3641 chosen 1588. 

20:17 And 2532 Jesus 2424 going up 305 5723 to 1519 Jerusalem 2414 took 3880 5627 the twelve 1427 disciples 3101 apart 2596 2398 in 1722 the way 3598, and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, 

20:18 Behold 2400 5628, we go up 305 5719 to 1519 Jerusalem 2414; and 2532 the Son 5207 of man 444 shall be betrayed 3860 5701 unto the chief priests 749 and 2532 unto the scribes 1122, and 2532 they shall condemn 2632 5692 him 846 to death 2288, 

20:19 And 2532 shall deliver 3860 5692 him 846 to the Gentiles 1484 to 1519 mock 1702 5658, and 2532 to scourge 3146 5658, and 2532 to crucify 4717 5658 [him]: and 2532 the third 5154 day 2250 he shall rise again 450 5698. 

20:20 Then 5119 came 4334 5627 to him 846 the mother 3384 of Zebedee's 2199 children 5207 with 3326 her 848 sons 5207, worshipping 4352 5723 [him], and 2532 desiring 154 5723 a certain 5100 thing 3844 of him 846. 

20:21 And 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto her 846, What 5101 wilt thou 2309 5719? She saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, Grant 2036 5628 that 2443 these 3778 my 3450 two 1417 sons 5207 may sit 2523 5661, the one 1520 on 1537 thy 4675 right hand 1188, and 2532 the other 1520 on 1537 the left 2176, in 1722 thy 4675 kingdom 932. 

20:22 But 1161 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627, Ye know 1492 5758 not 3756 what 5101 ye ask 154 5731. Are ye able 1410 5736 to drink 4095 5629 of the cup 4221 that I 1473 shall 3195 5719 drink of 4095 5721, and 2532 to be baptized 907 5743 with the baptism 908 that 3739 I 1473 am baptized with 907 5683? They say 3004 5719 unto him 846, We are able 1410 5736. 

20:23 And 2532 he saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Ye shall drink 4095 5695 indeed 3303 of my 3450 cup 4221, and 2532 be baptized 907 5743 with the baptism 908 that 3739 I 1473 am baptized with 907 5701: but 1161 to sit 2523 5658 on 1537 my 3450 right hand 1188, and 2532 on 1537 my 3450 left 2176, is 2076 5748 not 3756 mine 1699 to give 1325 5629, but 235 [it shall be given to them] for whom 3739 it is prepared 2090 5769 of 5259 my 3450 Father 3962. 

20:24 And 2532 when the ten 1176 heard 191 5660 [it], they were moved with indignation 23 5656 against 4012 the two 1417 brethren 80. 

20:25 But 1161 Jesus 2424 called 4341 5666 them 846 [unto him], and said 2036 5627, Ye know 1492 5758 that 3754 the princes 758 of the Gentiles 1484 exercise dominion over 2634 5719 them 846, and 2532 they that are great 3173 exercise authority upon 2715 5719 them 846. 

20:26 But 1161 it shall 2071 0 not 3756 be 2071 5704 so 3779 among 1722 you 5213: but 235 whosoever 1437 will 2309 5725 be 1096 5635 great 3173 among 1722 you 5213, let him be 2077 5749 your 5216 minister 1249; 

20:27 And 2532 whosoever 1437 will 2309 5725 be 1511 5750 chief 4413 among 1722 you 5213, let him be 2077 5749 your 5216 servant 1401: 

20:28 Even as 5618 the Son 5207 of man 444 came 2064 5627 not 3756 to be ministered unto 1247 5683, but 235 to minister 1247 5658, and 2532 to give 1325 5629 his 848 life 5590 a ransom 3083 for 473 many 4183. 

20:29 And 2532 as they departed 1607 5740 from 575 Jericho 2410, a great 4183 multitude 3793 followed 190 5656 him 846. 

20:30 And 2532, behold 2400 5628, two 1417 blind men 5185 sitting 2521 5740 by the way 3598 side 3844, when they heard 191 5660 that 3754 Jesus 2424 passed by 3855 5719, cried out 2896 5656, saying 3004 5723, Have mercy 1653 5657 on us 2248, O Lord 2962, [thou] Son 5207 of David 1138. 

20:31 And 1161 the multitude 3793 rebuked 2008 5656 them 846, because 2443 they should hold their peace 4623 5661: but 1161 they cried 2896 5707 the more 3185, saying 3004 5723, Have mercy 1653 5657 on us 2248, O Lord 2962, [thou] Son 5207 of David 1138. 

20:32 And 2532 Jesus 2424 stood still 2476 5631, and called 5455 5656 them 846, and 2532 said 2036 5627, What 5101 will ye 2309 5719 that I shall do 4160 5661 unto you 5213? 

20:33 They say 3004 5719 unto him 846, Lord 2962, that 2443 our 2257 eyes 3788 may be opened 455 5686. 

20:34 So 1161 Jesus 2424 had compassion 4697 5679 [on them], and touched 680 5662 their 846 eyes 3788: and 2532 immediately 2112 their 846 eyes 3788 received sight 308 5656, and 2532 they followed 190 5656 him 846. 

21:1 And 2532 when 3753 they drew nigh 1448 5656 unto 1519 Jerusalem 2414, and 2532 were come 2064 5627 to 1519 Bethphage 967, unto 4314 the mount 3735 of Olives 1636, then 5119 sent 649 5656 Jesus 2424 two 1417 disciples 3101, 

21:2 Saying 3004 5723 unto them 846, Go 4198 5680 into 1519 the village 2968 over against 561 you 5216, and 2532 straightway 2112 ye shall find 2147 5692 an ass 3688 tied 1210 5772, and 2532 a colt 4454 with 3326 her 846: loose 3089 5660 [them], and bring 71 5628 [them] unto me 3427. 

21:3 And 2532 if 1437 any [man] 5100 say 2036 5632 ought 5100 unto you 5213, ye shall say 2046 5692, 3754 The Lord 2962 hath 2192 5719 need 5532 of them 846; and 1161 straightway 2112 he will send 649 5692 them 846. 

21:4 All 1161 3650 this 5124 was done 1096 5754, that 2443 it might be fulfilled 4137 5686 which 3588 was spoken 4483 5685 by 1223 the prophet 4396, saying 3004 5723, 

21:5 Tell ye 2036 5628 the daughter 2364 of Sion 4622, Behold 2400 5628, thy 4675 King 935 cometh 2064 5736 unto thee 4671, meek 4239, and 2532 sitting 1910 5761 upon 1909 an ass 3688, and 2532 a colt 4454 the foal 5207 of an ass 5268. 

21:6 And 1161 the disciples 3101 went 4198 5679, and 2532 did 4160 5660 as 2531 Jesus 2424 commanded 4367 5656 them 846, 

21:7 And brought 71 5627 the ass 3688, and 2532 the colt 4454, and 2532 put 2007 5656 on 1883 them 846 their 848 clothes 2440, and 2532 they set 1940 5656 5625 1940 5656 [him] thereon 1883 846. 

21:8 And 1161 a very great 4118 multitude 3793 spread 4766 5656 their 1438 garments 2440 in 1722 the way 3598; others 1161 243 cut down 2875 5707 branches 2798 from 575 the trees 1186, and 2532 strawed 4766 5707 [them] in 1722 the way 3598. 

21:9 And 1161 the multitudes 3793 that went before 4254 5723, and 2532 that followed 190 5723, cried 2896 5707, saying 3004 5723, Hosanna 5614 to the Son 5207 of David 1138: Blessed 2127 5772 [is] he that cometh 2064 5740 in 1722 the name 3686 of the Lord 2962; Hosanna 5614 in 1722 the highest 5310. 

21:10 And 2532 when he was come 1525 5631 into 1519 Jerusalem 2414, all 3956 the city 4172 was moved 4579 5681, saying 3004 5723, Who 5101 is 2076 5748 this 3778? 

21:11 And 1161 the multitude 3793 said 3004 5707, This 3778 is 2076 5748 Jesus 2424 the prophet 4396 of 575 Nazareth 3478 of Galilee 1056. 

21:12 And 2532 Jesus 2424 went 1525 5627 into 1519 the temple 2411 of God 2316, and 2532 cast out 1544 5627 all them 3956 that sold 4453 5723 and 2532 bought 59 5723 in 1722 the temple 2411, and 2532 overthrew 2690 5656 the tables 5132 of the moneychangers 2855, and 2532 the seats 2515 of them that sold 4453 5723 doves 4058, 

21:13 And 2532 said 3004 5719 unto them 846, It is written 1125 5769, My 3450 house 3624 shall be called 2564 5701 the house 3624 of prayer 4335; but 1161 ye 5210 have made 4160 5656 it a den 4693 of thieves 3027. 

21:14 And 2532 the blind 5185 and 2532 the lame 5560 came 4334 5656 to him 846 in 1722 the temple 2411; and 2532 he healed 2323 5656 them 846. 

21:15 And 1161 when the chief priests 749 and 2532 scribes 1122 saw 1492 5631 the wonderful things 2297 that 3739 he did 4160 5656, and 2532 the children 3816 crying 2896 5723 in 1722 the temple 2411, and 2532 saying 3004 5723, Hosanna 5614 to the Son 5207 of David 1138; they were sore displeased 23 5656, 

21:16 And 2532 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Hearest thou 191 5719 what 5101 these 3778 say 3004 5719? And 1161 Jesus 2424 saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Yea 3483; have ye never 3763 read 314 5627, 3754 Out of 1537 the mouth 4750 of babes 3516 and 2532 sucklings 2337 5723 thou hast perfected 2675 5668 praise 136? 

21:17 And 2532 he left 2641 5631 them 846, and went 1831 5627 out of 1854 the city 4172 into 1519 Bethany 963; and 2532 he lodged 835 5675 there 1563. 

21:18 Now 1161 in the morning 4405 as he returned 1877 5723 into 1519 the city 4172, he hungered 3983 5656. 

21:19 And 2532 when he saw 1492 5631 a 3391 fig tree 4808 in 1909 the way 3598, he came 2064 5627 to 1909 it 846, and 2532 found 2147 5627 nothing 3762 thereon 1722 846, but 1508 leaves 5444 only 3440, and 2532 said 3004 5719 unto it 846, Let no 1096 0 fruit 2590 grow 1096 5638 on 1537 thee 4675 henceforward 3371 for 1519 ever 165. And 2532 presently 3916 the fig tree 4808 withered away 3583 5681. 

21:20 And 2532 when the disciples 3101 saw 1492 5631 [it], they marvelled 2296 5656, saying 3004 5723, How 4459 soon 3916 is the fig tree 4808 withered away 3583 5681! 

21:21 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5679 and 1161 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, If 1437 ye have 2192 5725 faith 4102, and 2532 doubt 1252 5686 not 3361, ye shall 4160 0 not 3756 only 3440 0 do 4160 5692 this 3440 [which is done] to the fig tree 4808, but 235 also if 2579 ye shall say 2036 5632 unto this 5129 mountain 3735, Be thou removed 142 5682, and 2532 be thou cast 906 5682 into 1519 the sea 2281; it shall be done 1096 5695. 

21:22 And 2532 all things 3956, whatsoever 302 3745 ye shall ask 154 5661 in 1722 prayer 4335, believing 4100 5723, ye shall receive 2983 5695. 

21:23 And 2532 when he was come 2064 5631 into 1519 the temple 2411, the chief priests 749 and 2532 the elders 4245 of the people 2992 came 4334 5656 unto him 846 as he was teaching 1321 5723, and said 3004 5723, By 1722 what 4169 authority 1849 doest thou 4160 5719 these things 5023? and 2532 who 5101 gave 1325 5656 thee 4671 this 5026 authority 1849? 

21:24 And 1161 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627 unto them 846, I also 2504 will ask 2065 5692 you 5209 one 1520 thing 3056, which 3739 if 1437 ye tell 2036 5632 me 3427, I in like wise 2504 will tell 2046 5692 you 5213 by 1722 what 4169 authority 1849 I do 4160 5719 these things 5023. 

21:25 The baptism 908 of John 2491, whence 4159 was it 2258 5713? from 1537 heaven 3772, or 2228 of 1537 men 444? And 1161 they reasoned 1260 5711 with 3844 themselves 1438, saying 3004 5723, If 1437 we shall say 2036 5632, From 1537 heaven 3772; he will say 2046 5692 unto us 2254, Why 1302 did ye 4100 0 not 3756 then 3767 believe 4100 5656 him 846? 

21:26 But 1161 if 1437 we shall say 2036 5632, Of 1537 men 444; we fear 5399 5736 the people 3793; for 1063 all 3956 hold 2192 5719 John 2491 as 5613 a prophet 4396. 

21:27 And 2532 they answered 611 5679 Jesus 2424, and said 2036 5627, We cannot 3756 tell 1492 5758. And 2532 he said 5346 5713 unto them 846, Neither 3761 tell 3004 5719 I 1473 you 5213 by 1722 what 4169 authority 1849 I do 4160 5719 these things 5023. 

21:28 But 1161 what 5101 think 1380 5719 ye 5213? A [certain] man 444 had 2192 5707 two 1417 sons 5043; and 2532 he came 4334 5631 to the first 4413, and said 2036 5627, Son 5043, go 5217 5720 work 2038 5737 to day 4594 in 1722 my 3450 vineyard 290. 

21:29 He answered 1161 611 5679 and said 2036 5627, I will 2309 5719 not 3756: but 1161 afterward 5305 he repented 3338 5679, and went 565 5627. 

21:30 And 2532 he came 4334 5631 to the second 1208, and said 2036 5627 likewise 5615. And 1161 he answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627, I 1473 [go], sir 2962: and 2532 went 565 5627 not 3756. 

21:31 Whether 5101 of 1537 them twain 1417 did 4160 5656 the will 2307 of [his] father 3962? They say 3004 5719 unto him 846, The first 4413. Jesus 2424 saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, That 3754 the publicans 5057 and 2532 the harlots 4204 go 4254 0 into 1519 the kingdom 932 of God 2316 before 4254 5719 you 5209. 

21:32 For 1063 John 2491 came 2064 5627 unto 4314 you 5209 in 1722 the way 3598 of righteousness 1343, and 2532 ye believed 4100 5656 him 846 not 3756: but 1161 the publicans 5057 and 2532 the harlots 4204 believed 4100 5656 him 846: and 1161 ye 5210, when ye had seen 1492 5631 [it], repented 3338 5675 not 3756 afterward 5305, that ye might believe 4100 5658 him 846. 

21:33 Hear 191 5657 another 243 parable 3850: There was 2258 5713 a certain 444 5100 householder 3617, which 3748 planted 5452 5656 a vineyard 290, and 2532 hedged 5418 it 846 round about 4060 5656, and 2532 digged 3736 5656 a winepress 3025 in 1722 it 846, and 2532 built 3618 5656 a tower 4444, and 2532 let 1554 0 it 846 out 1554 5639 to husbandmen 1092, and 2532 went into a far country 589 5656: 

21:34 And 1161 when 3753 the time 2540 of the fruit 2590 drew near 1448 5656, he sent 649 5656 his 848 servants 1401 to 4314 the husbandmen 1092, that they might receive 2983 5629 the fruits 2590 of it 846. 

21:35 And 2532 the husbandmen 1092 took 2983 5631 his 846 servants 1401, and beat 1194 5656 one 3739, 3303 and 1161 killed 615 5656 another 3739, and 1161 stoned 3036 5681 another 3739. 

21:36 Again 3825, he sent 649 5656 other 243 servants 1401 more 4119 than the first 4413: and 2532 they did 4160 5656 unto them 846 likewise 5615. 

21:37 But 1161 last of all 5305 he sent 649 5656 unto 4314 them 846 his 848 son 5207, saying 3004 5723, They will reverence 1788 5691 my 3450 son 5207. 

21:38 But 1161 when the husbandmen 1092 saw 1492 5631 the son 5207, they said 2036 5627 among 1722 themselves 1438, This 3778 is 2076 5748 the heir 2818; come 1205 5773, let us kill 615 5725 him 846, and 2532 let us seize 2722 5632 on his 846 inheritance 2817. 

21:39 And 2532 they caught 2983 5631 him 846, and cast 1544 5627 [him] out of 1854 the vineyard 290, and 2532 slew 615 5656 [him]. 

21:40 When 3752 the lord 2962 therefore 3767 of the vineyard 290 cometh 2064 5632, what 5101 will he do 4160 5692 unto those 1565 husbandmen 1092? 

21:41 They say 3004 5719 unto him 846, He will miserably 2560 destroy 622 5692 those 846 wicked men 2556, and 2532 will let out 1554 5695 [his] vineyard 290 unto other 243 husbandmen 1092, which 3748 shall render 591 5692 him 846 the fruits 2590 in 1722 their 846 seasons 2540. 

21:42 Jesus 2424 saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Did ye 314 0 never 3763 read 314 5627 in 1722 the scriptures 1124, The stone 3037 which 3739 the builders 3618 5723 rejected 593 5656, the same 3778 is become 1096 5675 1519 the head 2776 of the corner 1137: this 3778 is 3844 the Lord's 2962 doing 1096 5633, and 2532 it is 2076 5748 marvellous 2298 in 1722 our 2257 eyes 3788? 

21:43 Therefore 1223 5124 say I 3004 5719 unto you 5213, 3754 The kingdom 932 of God 2316 shall be taken 142 5701 from 575 you 5216, and 2532 given 1325 5701 to a nation 1484 bringing forth 4160 5723 the fruits 2590 thereof 846. 

21:44 And 2532 whosoever shall fall 4098 5631 on 1909 this 5126 stone 3037 shall be broken 4917 5701: but 1161 on 1909 whomsoever 302 it shall fall 4098 5632, it will grind 3039 0 him 846 to powder 3039 5692. 

21:45 And 2532 when the chief priests 749 and 2532 Pharisees 5330 had heard 191 5660 his parables 3850, they perceived 1097 5627 that 3754 he spake 3004 5719 of 4012 them 846. 

21:46 But 2532 when they sought 2212 5723 to lay hands 2902 5658 on him 846, they feared 5399 5675 the multitude 3793, because 1894 they took 2192 5707 him 846 for 5613 a prophet 4396. 

22:1 And 2532 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5679 and spake 2036 5627 unto them 846 again 3825 by 1722 parables 3850, and said 3004 5723, 

22:2 The kingdom 932 of heaven 3772 is like 3666 5681 unto a certain 444 king 935, which 3748 made 4160 5656 a marriage 1062 for his 848 son 5207, 

22:3 And 2532 sent forth 649 5656 his 848 servants 1401 to call 2564 5658 them that were bidden 2564 5772 to 1519 the wedding 1062: and 2532 they would 2309 5707 not 3756 come 2064 5629. 

22:4 Again 3825, he sent forth 649 5656 other 243 servants 1401, saying 3004 5723, Tell 2036 5628 them which are bidden 2564 5772, Behold 2400 5628, I have prepared 2090 5656 my 3450 dinner 712: my 3450 oxen 5022 and 2532 [my] fatlings 4619 [are] killed 2380 5772, and 2532 all things 3956 [are] ready 2092: come 1205 5773 unto 1519 the marriage 1062. 

22:5 But 1161 they made light of 272 5660 [it], and went their ways 565 5627, one 3303 to 1519 his 2398 farm 68, another 1161 to 1519 his 848 merchandise 1711: 

22:6 And 1161 the remnant 3062 took 2902 5660 his 846 servants 1401, and 2532 entreated [them] spitefully 5195 5656, and 2532 slew 615 5656 [them]. 

22:7 But 1161 when the king 935 heard 191 5660 [thereof], he was wroth 3710 5681: and 2532 he sent forth 3992 5660 his 848 armies 4753, and destroyed 622 5656 those 1565 murderers 5406, and 2532 burned up 1714 5656 their 846 city 4172. 

22:8 Then 5119 saith he 3004 5719 to his 848 servants 1401, 3303 The wedding 1062 is 2076 5748 ready 2092, but 1161 they which were bidden 2564 5772 were 2258 5713 not 3756 worthy 514. 

22:9 Go ye 4198 5737 therefore 3767 into 1909 the highways 1327 3598, and 2532 as many as 3745 302 ye shall find 2147 5632, bid 2564 5657 to 1519 the marriage 1062. 

22:10 So 2532 those 1565 servants 1401 went out 1831 5631 into 1519 the highways 3598, and gathered together 4863 5627 all 3956 as many as 3745 they found 2147 5627, both 5037 bad 4190 and 2532 good 18: and 2532 the wedding 1062 was furnished 4130 5681 with guests 345 5740. 

22:11 And 1161 when 1525 0 the king 935 came in 1525 5631 to see 2300 5664 the guests 345 5740, he saw 1492 5627 there 1563 a man 444 which had 1746 0 not 3756 on 1746 5765 a wedding 1062 garment 1742: 

22:12 And 2532 he saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, Friend 2083, how 4459 camest thou 1525 5627 in hither 5602 not 3361 having 2192 5723 a wedding 1062 garment 1742? And 1161 he was speechless 5392 5681. 

22:13 Then 5119 said 2036 5627 the king 935 to the servants 1249, Bind 1210 5660 him 846 hand 5495 and 2532 foot 4228, and take 142 0 him 846 away 142 5657, and 2532 cast 1544 5628 [him] into 1519 outer 1857 darkness 4655; there 1563 shall be 2071 5704 weeping 2805 and 2532 gnashing 1030 of teeth 3599. 

22:14 For 1063 many 4183 are 1526 5748 called 2822, but 1161 few 3641 [are] chosen 1588. 

22:15 Then 5119 went 4198 5679 the Pharisees 5330, and took 2983 5627 counsel 4824 how 3704 they might entangle 3802 5661 him 846 in 1722 [his] talk 3056. 

22:16 And 2532 they sent out 649 5719 unto him 846 their 848 disciples 3101 with 3326 the Herodians 2265, saying 3004 5723, Master 1320, we know 1492 5758 that 3754 thou art 1488 5748 true 227, and 2532 teachest 1321 5719 the way 3598 of God 2316 in 1722 truth 225, 2532 neither 3756 carest 3199 5719 thou 4671 for 4012 any 3762 [man]: for 1063 thou regardest 991 5719 not 1519 3756 the person 4383 of men 444. 

22:17 Tell 2036 5628 us 2254 therefore 3767, What 5101 thinkest 1380 5719 thou 4671? Is it lawful 1832 5748 to give 1325 5629 tribute 2778 unto Caesar 2541, or 2228 not 3756? 

22:18 But 1161 Jesus 2424 perceived 1097 5631 their 846 wickedness 4189, and said 2036 5627, Why 5101 tempt ye 3985 5719 me 3165, [ye] hypocrites 5273? 

22:19 Shew 1925 5657 me 3427 the tribute 2778 money 3546. And 1161 they brought 4374 5656 unto him 846 a penny 1220. 

22:20 And 2532 he saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Whose 5101 [is] this 3778 image 1504 and 2532 superscription 1923? 

22:21 They say 3004 5719 unto him 846, Caesar's 2541. Then 5119 saith he 3004 5719 unto them 846, Render 591 5628 therefore 3767 unto Caesar 2541 the things which are 3588 Caesar's 2541; and 2532 unto God 2316 the things that are 3588 God's 2316. 

22:22 When 2532 they had heard 191 5660 [these words], they marvelled 2296 5656, and 2532 left 863 5631 him 846, and went their way 565 5627. 

22:23 The same 1722 1565 day 2250 came 4334 5656 to him 846 the Sadducees 4523, which 3588 say 3004 5723 that there is 1511 5750 no 3361 resurrection 386, and 2532 asked 1905 5656 him 846, 

22:24 Saying 3004 5723, Master 1320, Moses 3475 said 2036 5627, If 1437 a man 5100 die 599 5632, having 2192 5723 no 3361 children 5043, his 848 brother 80 shall marry 1918 5692 his 846 wife 1135, and 2532 raise up 450 5692 seed 4690 unto his 846 brother 80. 

22:25 Now 1161 there were 2258 5713 with 3844 us 2254 seven 2033 brethren 80: and 2532 the first 4413, when he had married a wife 1060 5660, deceased 5053 5656, and 2532, having 2192 5723 no 3361 issue 4690, left 863 5656 his 848 wife 1135 unto his 848 brother 80: 

22:26 Likewise 3668 the second 1208 also 2532, and 2532 the third 5154, unto 2193 the seventh 2033. 

22:27 And 1161 last 5305 of all 3956 the woman 1135 died 599 5627 also 2532. 

22:28 Therefore 3767 in 1722 the resurrection 386 whose 5101 wife 1135 shall she be 2071 5704 of the seven 2033? for 1063 they all 3956 had 2192 5627 her 846. 

22:29 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5679 and 1161 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Ye do err 4105 5744, not 3361 knowing 1492 5761 the scriptures 1124, nor 3366 the power 1411 of God 2316. 

22:30 For 1063 in 1722 the resurrection 386 they neither 3777 marry 1060 5719, nor 3777 are given in marriage 1547 5743, but 235 are 1526 5748 as 5613 the angels 32 of God 2316 in 1722 heaven 3772. 

22:31 But 1161 as touching 4012 the resurrection 386 of the dead 3498, have ye 314 0 not 3756 read 314 5627 that which 3588 was spoken 4483 5685 unto you 5213 by 5259 God 2316, saying 3004 5723, 

22:32 I 1473 am 1510 5748 the God 2316 of Abraham 11, and 2532 the God 2316 of Isaac 2464, and 2532 the God 2316 of Jacob 2384? God 2316 is 2076 5748 not 3756 the God 2316 of the dead 3498, but 235 of the living 2198 5723. 

22:33 And 2532 when the multitude 3793 heard 191 5660 [this], they were astonished 1605 5712 at 1909 his 846 doctrine 1322. 

22:34 But 1161 when the Pharisees 5330 had heard 191 5660 that 3754 he had put 5392 0 the Sadducees 4523 to silence 5392 5656, they were gathered together 4863 5681 1909 846. 

22:35 Then 2532 one 1520 of 1537 them 846, [which was] a lawyer 3544, asked 1905 5656 [him a question], tempting 3985 5723 him 846, and 2532 saying 3004 5723, 

22:36 Master 1320, which 4169 [is] the great 3173 commandment 1785 in 1722 the law 3551? 

22:37 1161 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Thou shalt love 25 5692 the Lord 2962 thy 4675 God 2316 with 1722 all 3650 thy 4675 heart 2588, and 2532 with 1722 all 3650 thy 4675 soul 5590, and 2532 with 1722 all 3650 thy 4675 mind 1271. 

22:38 This 3778 is 2076 5748 the first 4413 and 2532 great 3173 commandment 1785. 

22:39 And 1161 the second 1208 [is] like 3664 unto it 846, Thou shalt love 25 5692 thy 4675 neighbour 4139 as 5613 thyself 4572. 

22:40 On 1722 these 5025 two 1417 commandments 1785 hang 2910 5743 all 3650 the law 3551 and 2532 the prophets 4396. 

22:41 While 1161 the Pharisees 5330 were gathered together 4863 5772, Jesus 2424 asked 1905 5656 them 846, 

22:42 Saying 3004 5723, What 5101 think 1380 5719 ye 5213 of 4012 Christ 5547? whose 5101 son 5207 is he 2076 5748? They say 3004 5719 unto him 846, [The Son] of David 1138. 

22:43 He saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, How 4459 then 3767 doth David 1138 in 1722 spirit 4151 call 2564 5719 him 846 Lord 2962, saying 3004 5723, 

22:44 The LORD 2962 said 2036 5627 unto my 3450 Lord 2962, Sit thou 2521 5737 on 1537 my 3450 right hand 1188, till 2193 302 I make 5087 5632 thine 4675 enemies 2190 thy 4675 footstool 5286 4228? 

22:45 If 1487 David 1138 then 3767 call 2564 5719 him 846 Lord 2962, how 4459 is he 2076 5748 his 846 son 5207? 

22:46 And 2532 no man 3762 was able 1410 5711 to answer 611 5677 him 846 a word 3056, neither 3761 durst 5111 5656 any 5100 [man] from 575 that 1565 day 2250 forth ask 1905 5658 him 846 any more 3765 [questions]. 

23:1 Then 5119 spake 2980 5656 Jesus 2424 to the multitude 3793, and 2532 to his 848 disciples 3101, 

23:2 Saying 3004 5723, The scribes 1122 and 2532 the Pharisees 5330 sit 2523 5656 in 1909 Moses 3475' seat 2515: 

23:3 All 3956 therefore 3767 whatsoever 302 3745 they bid 2036 5632 you 5213 observe 5083 5721, [that] observe 5083 5720 and 2532 do 4160 5720; but 1161 do 4160 5720 not 3361 ye after 2596 their 846 works 2041: for 1063 they say 3004 5719, and 2532 do 4160 5719 not 3756. 

23:4 For 1063 they bind 1195 5719 heavy 926 burdens 5413 and 2532 grievous to be borne 1419, and 2532 lay 2007 5719 [them] on 1909 men's 444 shoulders 5606; but 1161 they [themselves] will 2309 5719 not 3756 move 2795 5658 them 846 with one of their 848 fingers 1147. 

23:5 But 1161 all 3956 their 848 works 2041 they do 4160 5719 for 4314 to be seen 2300 5683 of men 444: 1161 they make broad 4115 5719 their 848 phylacteries 5440, and 2532 enlarge 3170 5719 the borders 2899 of their 848 garments 2440, 

23:6 And 5037 love 5368 5719 the uppermost rooms 4411 at 1722 feasts 1173, and 2532 the chief seats 4410 in 1722 the synagogues 4864, 

23:7 And 2532 greetings 783 in 1722 the markets 58, and 2532 to be called 2564 5745 of 5259 men 444, Rabbi 4461, Rabbi 4461. 

23:8 But 1161 be 2564 0 not 3361 ye 5210 called 2564 5686 Rabbi 4461: for 1063 one 1520 is 2076 5748 your 5216 Master 2519, [even] Christ 5547; and 1161 all 3956 ye 5210 are 2075 5748 brethren 80. 

23:9 And 2532 call 2564 5661 no 3361 [man] your 5216 father 3962 upon 1909 the earth 1093: for 1063 one 1520 is 2076 5748 your 5216 Father 3962, which 3588 is in 1722 heaven 3772. 

23:10 Neither 3366 be ye called 2564 5686 masters 2519: for 1063 one 1520 is 2076 5748 your 5216 Master 2519, [even] Christ 5547. 

23:11 But 1161 he that is greatest 3187 among you 5216 shall be 2071 5704 your 5216 servant 1249. 

23:12 And 1161 whosoever 3748 shall exalt 5312 5692 himself 1438 shall be abased 5013 5701; and 2532 he 3748 that shall humble 5013 5692 himself 1438 shall be exalted 5312 5701. 

23:13 But 1161 woe 3759 unto you 5213, scribes 1122 and 2532 Pharisees 5330, hypocrites 5273! for 3754 ye shut up 2808 5719 the kingdom 932 of heaven 3772 against 1715 men 444: for 1063 ye 5210 neither 3761 go in 1525 5736 [yourselves], neither 3756 suffer ye 863 5719 them that are entering 1525 5740 to go in 1525 5629. 

23:14 Woe 3759 unto you 5213, scribes 1122 and 2532 Pharisees 5330, hypocrites 5273! for 3754 ye devour 2719 5719 widows 5503' houses 3614, and 2532 for a pretence 4392 make 4336 0 long 3117 prayer 4336 5740: therefore 1223 5124 ye shall receive 2983 5695 the greater 4055 damnation 2917. 

23:15 Woe 3759 unto you 5213, scribes 1122 and 2532 Pharisees 5330, hypocrites 5273! for 3754 ye compass 4013 5719 sea 2281 and 2532 land 3584 to make 4160 5658 one 1520 proselyte 4339, and 2532 when 3752 he is made 1096 5638, ye make 4160 5719 him 846 twofold more 1362 the child 5207 of hell 1067 than yourselves 5216. 

23:16 Woe 3759 unto you 5213, [ye] blind 5185 guides 3595, which 3588 say 3004 5723, Whosoever 3739 302 shall swear 3660 5661 by 1722 the temple 3485, it is 2076 5748 nothing 3762; but 1161 whosoever 3739 302 shall swear 3660 5661 by 1722 the gold 5557 of the temple 3485, he is a debtor 3784 5719! 

23:17 [Ye] fools 3474 and 2532 blind 5185: for 1063 whether 5101 is 2076 5748 greater 3187, the gold 5557, or 2228 the temple 3485 that sanctifieth 37 5723 the gold 5557? 

23:18 And 2532, Whosoever 3739 1437 shall swear 3660 5661 by 1722 the altar 2379, it is 2076 5748 nothing 3762; but 1161 whosoever 302 sweareth 3660 5661 by 1722 the gift 1435 that is upon 1883 it 846, he is guilty 3784 5719. 

23:19 [Ye] fools 3474 and 2532 blind 5185: for 1063 whether 5101 [is] greater 3187, the gift 1435, or 2228 the altar 2379 that sanctifieth 37 5723 the gift 1435? 

23:20 Whoso therefore 3767 shall swear 3660 5660 by 1722 the altar 2379, sweareth 3660 5719 by 1722 it 846, and 2532 by 1722 all things 3956 thereon 1883 846. 

23:21 And 2532 whoso shall swear 3660 5660 by 1722 the temple 3485, sweareth 3660 5719 by 1722 it 846, and 2532 by 1722 him that dwelleth 2730 5723 therein 846. 

23:22 And 2532 he that shall swear 3660 5660 by 1722 heaven 3772, sweareth 3660 5719 by 1722 the throne 2362 of God 2316, and 2532 by 1722 him that sitteth 2521 5740 thereon 1883 846. 

23:23 Woe 3759 unto you 5213, scribes 1122 and 2532 Pharisees 5330, hypocrites 5273! for 3754 ye pay tithe 586 5719 of mint 2238 and 2532 anise 432 and 2532 cummin 2951, and 2532 have omitted 863 5656 the weightier 926 [matters] of the law 3551, judgment 2920, mercy 2532 1656, and 2532 faith 4102: these 5023 ought ye 1163 5713 to have done 4160 5658, and not 3361 to leave 863 0 the other 2548 undone 863 5721. 

23:24 [Ye] blind 5185 guides 3595, which strain at 1368 5723 a gnat 2971, and 1161 swallow 2666 5723 a camel 2574. 

23:25 Woe 3759 unto you 5213, scribes 1122 and 2532 Pharisees 5330, hypocrites 5273! for 3754 ye make clean 2511 5719 the outside 1855 of the cup 4221 and 2532 of the platter 3953, but 1161 within 2081 they are full 1073 5719 of 1537 extortion 724 and 2532 excess 192. 

23:26 [Thou] blind 5185 Pharisee 5330, cleanse 2511 5657 first 4412 that [which is] within 1787 the cup 4221 and 2532 platter 3953, that 2443 the outside 1622 of them 846 may be 1096 5638 clean 2513 also 2532. 

23:27 Woe 3759 unto you 5213, scribes 1122 and 2532 Pharisees 5330, hypocrites 5273! for 3754 ye are like 3945 5719 unto whited 2867 5772 sepulchres 5028, which 3748 indeed 3303 appear 5316 5727 beautiful 5611 outward 1855, but 1161 are within 2081 full 1073 5719 of dead 3498 [men's] bones 3747, and 2532 of all 3956 uncleanness 167. 

23:28 Even so 3779 ye 5210 also 2532 3303 outwardly 1855 appear 5316 5743 righteous 1342 unto men 444, but 1161 within 2081 ye are 2075 5748 full 3324 of hypocrisy 5272 and 2532 iniquity 458. 

23:29 Woe 3759 unto you 5213, scribes 1122 and 2532 Pharisees 5330, hypocrites 5273! because 3754 ye build 3618 5719 the tombs 5028 of the prophets 4396, and 2532 garnish 2885 5719 the sepulchres 3419 of the righteous 1342, 

23:30 And 2532 say 3004 5719, If 1487 we had been 2258 5713 in 1722 the days 2250 of our 2257 fathers 3962, we would 302 not 3756 have been 2258 5713 partakers 2844 with them 846 in 1722 the blood 129 of the prophets 4396. 

23:31 Wherefore 5620 ye be witnesses 3140 5719 unto yourselves 1438, that 3754 ye are 2075 5748 the children 5207 of them which killed 5407 5660 the prophets 4396. 

23:32 Fill 4137 0 ye 5210 up 4137 5657 then 2532 the measure 3358 of your 5216 fathers 3962. 

23:33 [Ye] serpents 3789, [ye] generation 1081 of vipers 2191, how 4459 can ye 5343 5632 escape 575 the damnation 2920 of hell 1067? 

23:34 Wherefore 1223 5124, behold 2400 5628, I 1473 send 649 5719 unto 4314 you 5209 prophets 4396, and 2532 wise men 4680, and 2532 scribes 1122: and 2532 [some] of 1537 them 846 ye shall kill 615 5692 and 2532 crucify 4717 5692; and 2532 [some] of 1537 them 846 shall ye scourge 3146 5692 in 1722 your 5216 synagogues 4864, and 2532 persecute 1377 5692 [them] from 575 city 4172 to 1519 city 4172: 

23:35 That 3704 upon 1909 you 5209 may come 2064 5632 all 3956 the righteous 1342 blood 129 shed 1632 5746 upon 1909 the earth 1093, from 575 the blood 129 of righteous 1342 Abel 6 unto 2193 the blood 129 of Zacharias 2197 son 5207 of Barachias 914, whom 3739 ye slew 5407 5656 between 3342 the temple 3485 and 2532 the altar 2379. 

23:36 Verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, All 3956 these things 5023 shall come 2240 5692 upon 1909 this 5026 generation 1074. 

23:37 O Jerusalem 2419, Jerusalem 2419, [thou] that killest 615 5723 the prophets 4396, and 2532 stonest 3036 5723 them which are sent 649 5772 unto 4314 thee 848, how often 4212 would I 2309 5656 have gathered 1996 0 thy 4675 children 5043 together 1996 5629, even as 5158 a hen 3733 gathereth 1996 5719 her 1438 chickens 3556 under 5259 [her] wings 4420, and 2532 ye would 2309 5656 not 3756! 

23:38 Behold 2400 5628, your 5216 house 3624 is left 863 5743 unto you 5213 desolate 2048. 

23:39 For 1063 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, Ye shall 1492 0 not 3364 see 1492 5632 me 3165 henceforth 575 737, till 2193 302 ye shall say 2036 5632, Blessed 2127 5772 [is] he that cometh 2064 5740 in 1722 the name 3686 of the Lord 2962. 

24:1 And 2532 Jesus 2424 went out 1831 5631, and departed 4198 5711 from 575 the temple 2411: and 2532 his 846 disciples 3101 came 4334 5656 to [him] for to shew 1925 5658 him 846 the buildings 3619 of the temple 2411. 

24:2 And 1161 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, See ye 991 5719 5720 not 3756 all 3956 these things 5023? verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, There shall 863 0 not 3364 be left 863 5686 here 5602 one stone 3037 upon 1909 another 3037, that 3739 shall 2647 0 not 3364 be thrown down 2647 5701. 

24:3 And 1161 as he sat 2521 5740 upon 1909 the mount 3735 of Olives 1636, the disciples 3101 came 4334 5656 unto him 846 privately 2596 2398, saying 3004 5723, Tell 2036 5628 us 2254, when 4219 shall 2071 0 these things 5023 be 2071 5704? and 2532 what 5101 [shall be] the sign 4592 of thy 4674 coming 3952, and 2532 of the end 4930 of the world 165? 

24:4 And 2532 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Take heed 991 5720 that no 3361 man 5100 deceive 4105 5661 you 5209. 

24:5 For 1063 many 4183 shall come 2064 5695 in 1909 my 3450 name 3686, saying 3004 5723, I 1473 am 1510 5748 Christ 5547; and 2532 shall deceive 4105 5692 many 4183. 

24:6 And 1161 ye shall 3195 5692 hear 191 5721 of wars 4171 and 2532 rumours 189 of wars 4171: see 3708 5720 that ye be 2360 0 not 3361 troubled 2360 5744: for 1063 all 3956 [these things] must 1163 5748 come to pass 1096 5635, but 235 the end 5056 is 2076 5748 not yet 3768. 

24:7 For 1063 nation 1484 shall rise 1453 5701 against 1909 nation 1484, and 2532 kingdom 932 against 1909 kingdom 932: and 2532 there shall be 2071 5704 famines 3042, and 2532 pestilences 3061, and 2532 earthquakes 4578, in divers 2596 places 5117. 

24:8 All 1161 3956 these 5023 [are] the beginning 746 of sorrows 5604. 

24:9 Then 5119 shall they deliver 3860 0 you 5209 up 3860 5692 to 1519 be afflicted 2347, and 2532 shall kill 615 5692 you 5209: and 2532 ye shall be 2071 5704 hated 3404 5746 of 5259 all 3956 nations 1484 for 1223 my 3450 name's sake 3686. 

24:10 And 2532 then 5119 shall many 4183 be offended 4624 5701, and 2532 shall betray 3860 5692 one another 240, and 2532 shall hate 3404 5692 one another 240. 

24:11 And 2532 many 4183 false prophets 5578 shall rise 1453 5701, and 2532 shall deceive 4105 5692 many 4183. 

24:12 And 2532 because 1223 iniquity 458 shall abound 4129 5683, the love 26 of many 4183 shall wax cold 5594 5691. 

24:13 But 1161 he that shall endure 5278 5660 unto 1519 the end 5056, the same 3778 shall be saved 4982 5701. 

24:14 And 2532 this 5124 gospel 2098 of the kingdom 932 shall be preached 2784 5701 in 1722 all 3650 the world 3625 for 1519 a witness 3142 unto all 3956 nations 1484; and 2532 then 5119 shall the end 5056 come 2240 5692. 

24:15 When 3752 ye therefore 3767 shall see 1492 5632 the abomination 946 of desolation 2050, spoken of 4483 5685 by 1223 Daniel 1158 the prophet 4396, stand 2476 5756 5625 2476 5761 in 1722 the holy 40 place 5117, (whoso readeth 314 5723, let him understand 3539 5720) 

24:16 Then 5119 let them which be in 1722 Judaea 2449 flee 5343 5720 into 1909 the mountains 3735: 

24:17 Let him which is on 1909 the housetop 1430 not 3361 come down 2597 5720 to take 142 5658 any thing 5100 out of 1537 his 848 house 3614: 

24:18 2532 Neither 3361 let him which is in 1722 the field 68 return 1994 5657 back 3694 to take 142 5658 his 848 clothes 2440. 

24:19 And 1161 woe 3759 unto them that are 2192 5723 with 1722 child 1064, and 2532 to them that give suck 2337 5723 in 1722 those 1565 days 2250! 

24:20 But 1161 pray ye 4336 5737 that 3363 0 your 5216 flight 5437 be 1096 5638 not 3363 in the winter 5494, neither 3366 on 1722 the sabbath day 4521: 

24:21 For 1063 then 5119 shall be 2071 5704 great 3173 tribulation 2347, such as 3634 was 1096 5754 not 3756 since 575 the beginning 746 of the world 2889 to this 2193 time 3568, no 3761, nor ever 3364 shall be 1096 5638. 

24:22 And 2532 except 1508 those 1565 days 2250 should be shortened 2856 5681, there 3756 should 302 no 3956 flesh 4561 be saved 4982 5681: but 1161 for 1223 the elect's sake 1588 those 1565 days 2250 shall be shortened 2856 5701. 

24:23 Then 5119 if 1437 any man 5100 shall say 2036 5632 unto you 5213, Lo 2400 5628, here 5602 [is] Christ 5547, or 2228 there 5602; believe 4100 5661 [it] not 3361. 

24:24 For 1063 there shall arise 1453 5701 false Christs 5580, and 2532 false prophets 5578, and 2532 shall shew 1325 5692 great 3173 signs 4592 and 2532 wonders 5059; insomuch that 5620, if 1487 [it were] possible 1415, they shall deceive 4105 5658 the very 2532 elect 1588. 

24:25 Behold 2400 5628, I have told 4280 0 you 5213 before 4280 5758. 

24:26 Wherefore 3767 if 1437 they shall say 2036 5632 unto you 5213, Behold 2400 5628, he is 2076 5748 in 1722 the desert 2048; go 1831 0 not 3361 forth 1831 5632: behold 2400 5628, [he is] in 1722 the secret chambers 5009; believe 4100 5661 [it] not 3361. 

24:27 For 1063 as 5618 the lightning 796 cometh 1831 5736 out of 575 the east 395, and 2532 shineth 5316 5727 even unto 2193 the west 1424; so 3779 shall 2071 0 also 2532 the coming 3952 of the Son 5207 of man 444 be 2071 5704. 

24:28 For 1063 wheresoever 1437 3699 the carcase 4430 is 5600 5753, there 1563 will 4863 0 the eagles 105 be gathered together 4863 5701. 

24:29 Immediately 1161 2112 after 3326 the tribulation 2347 of those 1565 days 2250 shall the sun 2246 be darkened 4654 5701, and 2532 the moon 4582 shall 1325 0 not 3756 give 1325 5692 her 848 light 5338, and 2532 the stars 792 shall fall 4098 5699 from 575 heaven 3772, and 2532 the powers 1411 of the heavens 3772 shall be shaken 4531 5701: 

24:30 And 2532 then 5119 shall appear 5316 5691 the sign 4592 of the Son 5207 of man 444 in 1722 heaven 3772: and 2532 then 5119 shall 2875 0 all 3956 the tribes 5443 of the earth 1093 mourn 2875 5695, and 2532 they shall see 3700 5695 the Son 5207 of man 444 coming 2064 5740 in 1909 the clouds 3507 of heaven 3772 with 3326 power 1411 and 2532 great 4183 glory 1391. 

24:31 And 2532 he shall send 649 5692 his 848 angels 32 with 3326 a great 3173 sound 5456 of a trumpet 4536, and 2532 they shall gather together 1996 5692 his 846 elect 1588 from 1537 the four 5064 winds 417, from 575 one end 206 of heaven 3772 to 2193 the other 206 846. 

24:32 Now 1161 learn 3129 5628 a parable 3850 of 575 the fig tree 4808; When 3752 his 846 branch 2798 is 1096 5638 yet 2235 tender 527, and 2532 putteth forth 1631 5725 leaves 5444, ye know 1097 5719 that 3754 summer 2330 [is] nigh 1451: 

24:33 So 3779 likewise 2532 ye 5210, when 3752 ye shall see 1492 5632 all 3956 these things 5023, know 1097 5719 5720 that 3754 it is 2076 5748 near 1451, [even] at 1909 the doors 2374. 

24:34 Verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, This 3778 generation 1074 shall not 3364 pass 3928 5632, till 302 2193 all 3956 these things 5023 be fulfilled 1096 5638. 

24:35 Heaven 3772 and 2532 earth 1093 shall pass away 3928 5695, but 1161 my 3450 words 3056 shall 3928 0 not 3364 pass away 3928 5632. 

24:36 But 1161 of 4012 that 1565 day 2250 and 2532 hour 5610 knoweth 1492 5758 no 3762 [man], no, not 3761 the angels 32 of heaven 3772, but 1508 my 3450 Father 3962 only 3441. 

24:37 But 1161 as 5618 the days 2250 of Noe 3575 [were], so 3779 shall 2071 0 also 2532 the coming 3952 of the Son 5207 of man 444 be 2071 5704. 

24:38 For 1063 as 5618 in 1722 the days 2250 that were 2258 5713 before 4253 the flood 2627 they were eating 5176 5723 and 2532 drinking 4095 5723, marrying 1060 5723 and 2532 giving in marriage 1547 5723, until 891 the day 2250 that 3739 Noe 3575 entered 1525 5627 into 1519 the ark 2787, 

24:39 And 2532 knew 1097 5627 not 3756 until 2193 the flood 2627 came 2064 5627, and 2532 took 142 0 them all 537 away 142 5656; so 3779 shall 2071 0 also 2532 the coming 3952 of the Son 5207 of man 444 be 2071 5704. 

24:40 Then 5119 shall 2071 0 two 1417 be 2071 5704 in 1722 the field 68; the one 1520 shall be taken 3880 5743, and 2532 the other 1520 left 863 5743. 

24:41 Two 1417 [women shall be] grinding 229 5723 at 1722 the mill 3459; the one 3391 shall be taken 3880 5743, and 2532 the other 3391 left 863 5743. 

24:42 Watch 1127 5720 therefore 3767: for 3754 ye know 1492 5758 not 3756 what 4169 hour 5610 your 5216 Lord 2962 doth come 2064 5736. 

24:43 But 1161 know 1097 5719 5720 this 1565, that 3754 if 1487 the goodman of the house 3617 had known 1492 5715 in what 4169 watch 5438 the thief 2812 would come 2064 5736, he would 302 have watched 1127 5656, and 2532 would 302 not 3756 have suffered 1439 5656 his 848 house 3614 to be broken up 1358 5650. 

24:44 Therefore 1223 5124 be 1096 5737 ye 5210 also 2532 ready 2092: for 3754 in such 3739 an hour 5610 as ye think 1380 5719 not 3756 the Son 5207 of man 444 cometh 2064 5736. 

24:45 Who 5101 then 686 is 2076 5748 a faithful 4103 and 2532 wise 5429 servant 1401, whom 3739 his 846 lord 2962 hath made ruler 2525 5656 over 1909 his 848 household 2322, to give 1325 5721 them 846 meat 5160 in 1722 due season 2540? 

24:46 Blessed 3107 [is] that 1565 servant 1401, whom 3739 his 846 lord 2962 when he cometh 2064 5631 shall find 2147 5692 so 3779 doing 4160 5723. 

24:47 Verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, That 3754 he shall make 2525 0 him 846 ruler 2525 5692 over 1909 all 3956 his 848 goods 5224 5723. 

24:48 But and 1161 if 1437 that 1565 evil 2556 servant 1401 shall say 2036 5632 in 1722 his 848 heart 2588, My 3450 lord 2962 delayeth 5549 5719 his coming 2064 5629; 

24:49 And 2532 shall begin 756 5672 to smite 5180 5721 [his] fellowservants 4889, and 1161 to eat 2068 5721 and 2532 drink 4095 5721 with 3326 the drunken 3184 5723; 

24:50 The lord 2962 of that 1565 servant 1401 shall come 2240 5692 in 1722 a day 2250 when 3739 he looketh 4328 5719 not 3756 for [him], and 2532 in 1722 an hour 5610 that 3739 he is 1097 0 not 3756 aware of 1097 5719, 

24:51 And 2532 shall cut 1371 0 him 846 asunder 1371 5692, and 2532 appoint 5087 5692 [him] his 846 portion 3313 with 3326 the hypocrites 5273: there 1563 shall be 2071 5704 weeping 2805 and 2532 gnashing 1030 of teeth 3599. 

25:1 Then 5119 shall the kingdom 932 of heaven 3772 be likened 3666 5701 unto ten 1176 virgins 3933, which 3748 took 2983 5631 their 848 lamps 2985, and went forth 1831 5627 to meet 529 1519 the bridegroom 3566. 

25:2 And 1161 five 4002 of 1537 them 846 were 2258 5713 wise 5429, and 2532 five 4002 [were] foolish 3474. 

25:3 They 3748 that [were] foolish 3474 took 2983 5631 their 846 1438 lamps 2985, and took 2983 5627 no 3756 oil 1637 with 3326 them 1438: 

25:4 But 1161 the wise 5429 took 2983 5627 oil 1637 in 1722 their 848 vessels 30 with 3326 their 848 lamps 2985. 

25:5 While 1161 the bridegroom 3566 tarried 5549 5723, they all 3956 slumbered 3573 5656 and 2532 slept 2518 5707. 

25:6 And 1161 at midnight 3319 3571 there was a cry 2906 made 1096 5754, Behold 2400 5628, the bridegroom 3566 cometh 2064 5736; go ye out 1831 5737 to 1519 meet 529 him 846. 

25:7 Then 5119 all 3956 those 1565 virgins 3933 arose 1453 5681, and 2532 trimmed 2885 5656 their 848 lamps 2985. 

25:8 And 1161 the foolish 3474 said 2036 5627 unto the wise 5429, Give 1325 5628 us 2254 of 1537 your 5216 oil 1637; for 3754 our 2257 lamps 2985 are gone out 4570 5743. 

25:9 But 1161 the wise 5429 answered 611 5662, saying 3004 5723, [Not so]; lest 3379 there be 714 0 not 3756 enough 714 5661 for us 2254 and 2532 you 5213: but 1161 go ye 4198 5737 rather 3123 to them 4314 that sell 4453 5723, and 2532 buy 59 5657 for yourselves 1438. 

25:10 And 1161 while they went 565 5740 to buy 59 5658, the bridegroom 3566 came 2064 5627; and 2532 they that were ready 2092 went in 1525 5627 with 3326 him 846 to 1519 the marriage 1062: and 2532 the door 2374 was shut 2808 5681. 

25:11 Afterward 1161 5305 came 2064 5736 also 2532 the other 3062 virgins 3933, saying 3004 5723, Lord 2962, Lord 2962, open 455 5657 to us 2254. 

25:12 But 1161 he answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627, Verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, I know 1492 5758 you 5209 not 3756. 

25:13 Watch 1127 5720 therefore 3767, for 3754 ye know 1492 5758 neither 3756 the day 2250 nor 3761 the hour 5610 wherein 1722 3739 the Son 5207 of man 444 cometh 2064 5736. 

25:14 For 1063 [the kingdom of heaven is] as 5618 a man 444 travelling into a far country 589 5723, [who] called 2564 5656 his own 2398 servants 1401, and 2532 delivered 3860 5656 unto them 846 his 848 goods 5224 5723. 

25:15 And 2532 unto one 3303 he gave 1325 5656 five 4002 talents 5007, 1161 to another 3739 two 1417, and 1161 to another 3739 one 1520; to every man 1538 according 2596 to his several 2398 ability 1411; and 2532 straightway 2112 took his journey 589 5656. 

25:16 Then 1161 he that had received 2983 5631 the five 4002 talents 5007 went 4198 5679 and traded 2038 5662 with 1722 the same 846, and 2532 made 4160 5656 [them] other 243 five 4002 talents 5007. 

25:17 And 2532 likewise 5615 he that [had received] 3588 two 1417, he also 2532 gained 2770 5656 other 243 two 1417. 

25:18 But 1161 he that had received 2983 5631 one 1520 went 565 5631 and digged 3736 5656 in 1722 the earth 1093, and 2532 hid 613 5656 his 848 lord's 2962 money 694. 

25:19 After 1161 3326 a long 4183 time 5550 the lord 2962 of those 1565 servants 1401 cometh 2064 5736, and 2532 reckoneth 4868 5719 3056 with 3326 them 846. 

25:20 And so 2532 he that had received 2983 5631 five 4002 talents 5007 came 4334 5631 and brought 4374 5656 other 243 five 4002 talents 5007, saying 3004 5723, Lord 2962, thou deliveredst 3860 5656 unto me 3427 five 4002 talents 5007: behold 2396, I have gained 2770 5656 beside 1909 them 846 five 4002 talents 5007 more 243. 

25:21 1161 His 846 lord 2962 said 5346 5713 unto him 846, Well done 2095, [thou] good 18 and 2532 faithful 4103 servant 1401: thou hast been 2258 5713 faithful 4103 over 1909 a few things 3641, I will make 2525 0 thee 4571 ruler 2525 5692 over 1909 many things 4183: enter thou 1525 5628 into 1519 the joy 5479 of thy 4675 lord 2962. 

25:22 1161 He also 2532 that had received 2983 5631 two 1417 talents 5007 came 4334 5631 and said 2036 5627, Lord 2962, thou deliveredst 3860 5656 unto me 3427 two 1417 talents 5007: behold 2396, I have gained 2770 5656 two 1417 other 243 talents 5007 beside 1909 them 846. 

25:23 His 846 lord 2962 said 5346 5713 unto him 846, Well done 2095, good 18 and 2532 faithful 4103 servant 1401; thou hast been 2258 5713 faithful 4103 over 1909 a few things 3641, I will make 2525 0 thee 4571 ruler 2525 5692 over 1909 many things 4183: enter thou 1525 5628 into 1519 the joy 5479 of thy 4675 lord 2962. 

25:24 Then 1161 2532 he which had received 2983 5761 the one 1520 talent 5007 came 4334 5631 and said 2036 5627, Lord 2962, I knew 1097 5627 thee 4571 that 3754 thou art 1488 5748 an hard 4642 man 444, reaping 2325 5723 where 3699 thou hast 4687 0 not 3756 sown 4687 5656, and 2532 gathering 4863 5723 where 3606 thou hast 1287 0 not 3756 strawed 1287 5656: 

25:25 And 2532 I was afraid 5399 5679, and went 565 5631 and hid 2928 5656 thy 4675 talent 5007 in 1722 the earth 1093: lo 2396, [there] thou hast 2192 5719 [that is] thine 4674. 

25:26 1161 His 846 lord 2962 answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627 unto him 846, [Thou] wicked 4190 and 2532 slothful 3636 servant 1401, thou knewest 1492 5715 that 3754 I reap 2325 5719 where 3699 I sowed 4687 5656 not 3756, and 2532 gather 4863 5719 where 3606 I have 1287 0 not 3756 strawed 1287 5656: 

25:27 Thou 4571 oughtest 1163 5713 therefore 3767 to have put 906 5629 my 3450 money 694 to the exchangers 5133, and 2532 [then] at my coming 2064 5631 I 1473 should 302 have received 2865 5668 mine own 1699 with 4862 usury 5110. 

25:28 Take 142 5657 therefore 3767 the talent 5007 from 575 him 846, and 2532 give 1325 5628 [it] unto him which hath 2192 5723 ten 1176 talents 5007. 

25:29 For 1063 unto every one 3956 that hath 2192 5723 shall be given 1325 5701, and 2532 he shall have abundance 4052 5701: but 1161 from 575 him 846 that hath 2192 5723 not 3361 shall be taken away 142 5701 even 2532 that which 3739 he hath 2192 5719. 

25:30 And 2532 cast ye 1544 5720 the unprofitable 888 servant 1401 into 1519 outer 1857 darkness 4655: there 1563 shall be 2071 5704 weeping 2805 and 2532 gnashing 1030 of teeth 3599. 

25:31 When 1161 3752 the Son 5207 of man 444 shall come 2064 5632 in 1722 his 848 glory 1391, and 2532 all 3956 the holy 40 angels 32 with 3326 him 846, then 5119 shall he sit 2523 5692 upon 1909 the throne 2362 of his 848 glory 1391: 

25:32 And 2532 before 1715 him 846 shall be gathered 4863 5701 all 3956 nations 1484: and 2532 he shall separate 873 5692 them 846 one 240 0 from 575 another 240, as 5618 a shepherd 4166 divideth 873 5719 [his] sheep 4263 from 575 the goats 2056: 

25:33 And 2532 he shall set 2476 5692 3303 the sheep 4263 on 1537 his 848 right hand 1188, but 1161 the goats 2055 on 1537 the left 2176. 

25:34 Then 5119 shall the King 935 say 2046 5692 unto them on 1537 his 848 right hand 1188, Come 1205 5773, ye blessed 2127 5772 of my 3450 Father 3962, inherit 2816 5657 the kingdom 932 prepared 2090 5772 for you 5213 from 575 the foundation 2602 of the world 2889: 

25:35 For 1063 I was an hungred 3983 5656, and 2532 ye gave 1325 5656 me 3427 meat 5315 5629: I was thirsty 1372 5656, and 2532 ye gave 4222 0 me 3165 drink 4222 5656: I was 2252 5713 a stranger 3581, and 2532 ye took 4863 0 me 3165 in 4863 5627: 

25:36 Naked 1131, and 2532 ye clothed 4016 5627 me 3165: I was sick 770 5656, and 2532 ye visited 1980 5662 me 3165: I was 2252 5713 in 1722 prison 5438, and 2532 ye came 2064 5627 unto 4314 me 3165. 

25:37 Then 5119 shall the righteous 1342 answer 611 5700 him 846, saying 3004 5723, Lord 2962, when 4219 saw we 1492 5627 thee 4571 an hungred 3983 5723, and 2532 fed 5142 5656 [thee]? or 2228 thirsty 1372 5723, and 2532 gave [thee] drink 4222 5656? 

25:38 1161 When 4219 saw we 1492 5627 thee 4571 a stranger 3581, and 2532 took [thee] in 4863 5627? or 2228 naked 1131, and 2532 clothed 4016 5627 [thee]? 

25:39 1161 Or when 4219 saw we 1492 5627 thee 4571 sick 772, or 2228 in 1722 prison 5438, and 2532 came 2064 5627 unto 4314 thee 4571? 

25:40 And 2532 the King 935 shall answer 611 5679 and say 2046 5692 unto them 846, Verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, Inasmuch 1909 as 3745 ye have done 4160 5656 [it] unto one 1520 of the least 1646 of these 5130 my 3450 brethren 80, ye have done 4160 5656 [it] unto me 1698. 

25:41 Then 5119 shall he say 2046 5692 also 2532 unto them on 1537 the left hand 2176, Depart 4198 5737 from 575 me 1700, ye cursed 2672 5772, into 1519 everlasting 166 fire 4442, prepared 2090 5772 for the devil 1228 and 2532 his 846 angels 32: 

25:42 For 1063 I was an hungred 3983 5656, and 2532 ye gave 1325 5656 me 3427 no 3756 meat 5315 5629: I was thirsty 1372 5656, and 2532 ye gave 4222 0 me 3165 no 3756 drink 4222 5656: 

25:43 I was 2252 5713 a stranger 3581, and 2532 ye took 4863 0 me 3165 not 3756 in 4863 5627: naked 1131, and 2532 ye clothed 4016 5627 me 3165 not 3756: sick 772, and 2532 in 1722 prison 5438, and 2532 ye visited 1980 5662 me 3165 not 3756. 

25:44 Then 5119 shall they 611 0 also 2532 answer 611 5700 him 846, saying 3004 5723, Lord 2962, when 4219 saw we 1492 5627 thee 4571 an hungred 3983 5723, or 2228 athirst 1372 5723, or 2228 a stranger 3581, or 2228 naked 1131, or 2228 sick 772, or 2228 in 1722 prison 5438, and 2532 did 1247 0 not 3756 minister 1247 5656 unto thee 4671? 

25:45 Then 5119 shall he answer 611 5700 them 846, saying 3004 5723, Verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, Inasmuch 1909 as 3745 ye did 4160 5656 [it] not 3756 to one 1520 of the least 1646 of these 5130, ye did 4160 5656 [it] not 3761 to me 1698. 

25:46 And 2532 these 3778 shall go away 565 5695 into 1519 everlasting 166 punishment 2851: but 1161 the righteous 1342 into 1519 life 2222 eternal 166. 

26:1 And 2532 it came to pass 1096 5633, when 3753 Jesus 2424 had finished 5055 5656 all 3956 these 5128 sayings 3056, he said 2036 5627 unto his 848 disciples 3101, 

26:2 Ye know 1492 5758 that 3754 after 3326 two 1417 days 2250 is 1096 5736 [the feast of] the passover 3957, and 2532 the Son 5207 of man 444 is betrayed 3860 5743 to 1519 be crucified 4717 5683. 

26:3 Then 5119 assembled together 4863 5681 the chief priests 749, and 2532 the scribes 1122, and 2532 the elders 4245 of the people 2992, unto 1519 the palace 833 of the high priest 749, who 3588 was called 3004 5746 Caiaphas 2533, 

26:4 And 2532 consulted 4823 5668 that 2443 they might take 2902 5661 Jesus 2424 by subtilty 1388, and 2532 kill 615 5725 [him]. 

26:5 But 1161 they said 3004 5707, Not 3361 on 1722 the feast 1859 [day], lest 3363 there be 1096 5638 an uproar 2351 among 1722 the people 2992. 

26:6 Now 1161 when Jesus 2424 was 1096 5637 in 1722 Bethany 963, in 1722 the house 3614 of Simon 4613 the leper 3015, 

26:7 There came 4334 5627 unto him 846 a woman 1135 having 2192 5723 an alabaster box 211 of very precious 927 ointment 3464, and 2532 poured it 2708 5656 on 1909 his 846 head 2776, as he sat 345 5740 [at meat]. 

26:8 But 1161 when his 846 disciples 3101 saw 1492 5631 [it], they had indignation 23 5656, saying 3004 5723, To 1519 what purpose 5101 [is] this 3778 waste 684? 

26:9 For 1063 this 5124 ointment 3464 might 1410 5711 have been sold 4097 5683 for much 4183, and 2532 given 1325 5683 to the poor 4434. 

26:10 When 1161 Jesus 2424 understood 1097 5631 [it], he said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Why 5101 trouble ye 2873 3930 5719 the woman 1135? for 1063 she hath wrought 2038 5662 a good 2570 work 2041 upon 1519 me 1691. 

26:11 For 1063 ye have 2192 5719 the poor 4434 always 3842 with 3326 you 1438; but 1161 me 1691 ye have 2192 5719 not 3756 always 3842. 

26:12 For in that 1063 she 3778 hath poured 906 5631 this 5124 ointment 3464 on 1909 my 3450 body 4983, she did 4160 5656 [it] for 4314 my 3165 burial 1779 5658. 

26:13 Verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, Wheresoever 3699 1437 this 5124 gospel 2098 shall be preached 2784 5686 in 1722 the whole 3650 world 2889, [there] shall also 2532 this, that this woman 3778 hath done 4160 5656, be told 2980 5701 for 1519 a memorial 3422 of her 846. 

26:14 Then 5119 one 1520 of the twelve 1427, called 3004 5746 Judas 2455 Iscariot 2469, went 4198 5679 unto 4314 the chief priests 749, 

26:15 And said 2036 5627 [unto them], What 5101 will ye 2309 5719 give 1325 5629 me 3427, and 2504 I will deliver 3860 5692 him 846 unto you 5213? And 1161 they covenanted 2476 5627 with him 846 for thirty 5144 pieces of silver 694. 

26:16 And 2532 from 575 that time 5119 he sought 2212 5707 opportunity 2120 to 2443 betray 3860 5632 him 846. 

26:17 Now 1161 the first 4413 [day] of the [feast of] unleavened bread 106 the disciples 3101 came 4334 5656 to Jesus 2424, saying 3004 5723 unto him 846, Where 4226 wilt thou 2309 5719 that we prepare 2090 5661 for thee 4671 to eat 5315 5629 the passover 3957? 

26:18 And 1161 he said 2036 5627, Go 5217 5720 into 1519 the city 4172 to 4314 such a man 1170, and 2532 say 2036 5628 unto him 846, The Master 1320 saith 3004 5719, My 3450 time 2540 is 2076 5748 at hand 1451; I will keep 4160 5719 the passover 3957 at 4314 thy house 4571 with 3326 my 3450 disciples 3101. 

26:19 And 2532 the disciples 3101 did 4160 5656 as 5613 Jesus 2424 had appointed 4929 5656 them 846; and 2532 they made ready 2090 5656 the passover 3957. 

26:20 Now 1161 when the even 3798 was come 1096 5637, he sat down 345 5711 with 3326 the twelve 1427. 

26:21 And 2532 as they did eat 2068 5723, he said 2036 5627, Verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, that 3754 one 1520 of 1537 you 5216 shall betray 3860 5692 me 3165. 

26:22 And 2532 they were exceeding 4970 sorrowful 3076 5746, and began 756 5662 every one 1538 of them 846 to say 3004 5721 unto him 846, Lord 2962, is 1510 5748 it 3385 I 1473? 

26:23 And 1161 he answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627, He that dippeth 1686 5660 [his] hand 5495 with 3326 me 1700 in 1722 the dish 5165, the same 3778 shall betray 3860 5692 me 3165. 

26:24 3303 The Son 5207 of man 444 goeth 5217 5719 as 2531 it is written 1125 5769 of 4012 him 846: but 1161 woe 3759 unto that 1565 man 444 by 1223 whom 3739 the Son 5207 of man 444 is betrayed 3860 5743! it had been 2258 5713 good 2570 for that 1565 man 846 if 1487 he 444 had 1080 0 not 3756 been born 1080 5681. 

26:25 Then 1161 Judas 2455, which 3588 betrayed 3860 5723 him 846, answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627, Master 4461, is 1510 5748 it 3385 I 1473? He said 3004 5719 unto him 846, Thou 4771 hast said 2036 5627. 

26:26 And 1161 as they 846 were eating 2068 5723, Jesus 2424 took 2983 5631 bread 740, and 2532 blessed 2127 5660 [it], and 2532 brake 2806 5656 [it], and 2532 gave 1325 5707 [it] to the disciples 3101, and 2532 said 2036 5627, Take 2983 5628, eat 5315 5628; this 5124 is 2076 5748 my 3450 body 4983. 

26:27 And 2532 he took 2983 5631 the cup 4221, and 2532 gave thanks 2168 5660, and gave 1325 5656 [it] to them 846, saying 3004 5723, Drink ye 4095 5628 all 3956 of 1537 it 846; 

26:28 For 1063 this 5124 is 2076 5748 my 3450 blood 129 of the new 2537 testament 1242, which 3588 is shed 1632 5746 for 4012 many 4183 for 1519 the remission 859 of sins 266. 

26:29 But 1161 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, I will 4095 0 not 3754 3364 drink 4095 5632 henceforth 575 737 of 1537 this 5127 fruit 1081 of the vine 288, until 2193 that 1565 day 2250 when 3752 I drink 4095 5719 5725 it 846 new 2537 with 3326 you 5216 in 1722 my 3450 Father's 3962 kingdom 932. 

26:30 And 2532 when they had sung an hymn 5214 5660, they went out 1831 5627 into 1519 the mount 3735 of Olives 1636. 

26:31 Then 5119 saith 3004 5719 Jesus 2424 unto them 846, All 3956 ye 5210 shall be offended 4624 5701 because 1722 of me 1722 1698 this 5026 night 3571: for 1063 it is written 1125 5769, I will smite 3960 5692 the shepherd 4166, and 2532 the sheep 4263 of the flock 4167 shall be scattered abroad 1287 5701. 

26:32 But 1161 after 3326 I 3165 am risen again 1453 5683, I will go before 4254 5692 you 5209 into 1519 Galilee 1056. 

26:33 Peter 4074 answered 611 5679 and 1161 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, 2532 Though 1499 all 3956 [men] shall be offended 4624 5701 because 1722 of thee 4671, [yet] will I 1473 never 3763 be offended 4624 5701. 

26:34 Jesus 2424 said 5346 5713 unto him 846, Verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto thee 4671, That 3754 this 1722 5026 night 3571, before 4250 the cock 220 crow 5455 5658, thou shalt deny 533 5695 me 3165 thrice 5151. 

26:35 Peter 4074 said 3004 5719 unto him 846, Though 2579 I 3165 should 1163 5753 die 599 5629 with 4862 thee 4671, yet 3364 0 will I 533 0 not 3364 deny 533 5695 thee 4571. Likewise 3668 also 2532 said 2036 5627 all 3956 the disciples 3101. 

26:36 Then 5119 cometh 2064 5736 Jesus 2424 with 3326 them 846 unto 1519 a place 5564 called 3004 5746 Gethsemane 1068, and 2532 saith 3004 5719 unto the disciples 3101, Sit ye 2523 5657 here 847, while 2193 I go 565 5631 and pray 4336 5667 yonder 1563. 

26:37 And 2532 he took with him 3880 5631 Peter 4074 and 2532 the two 1417 sons 5207 of Zebedee 2199, and began 756 5662 to be sorrowful 3076 5745 and 2532 very heavy 85 5721. 

26:38 Then 5119 saith he 3004 5719 unto them 846, My 3450 soul 5590 is 2076 5748 exceeding sorrowful 4036, even unto 2193 death 2288: tarry ye 3306 5657 here 5602, and 2532 watch 1127 5720 with 3326 me 1700. 

26:39 And 2532 he went 4281 0 a little 3397 further 4281 5631, and 2532 fell 4098 5627 on 1909 his 848 face 4383, and 2532 prayed 4336 5740, saying 3004 5723, O my 3450 Father 3962, if 1487 it be 2076 5748 possible 1415, let 3928 0 this 5124 cup 4221 pass 3928 5628 from 575 me 1700: nevertheless 4133 not 3756 as 5613 I 1473 will 2309 5719, but 235 as 5613 thou 4771 [wilt]. 

26:40 And 2532 he cometh 2064 5736 unto 4314 the disciples 3101, and 2532 findeth 2147 5719 them 846 asleep 2518 5723, and 2532 saith 3004 5719 unto Peter 4074, What 3779, could ye 2480 5656 not 3756 watch 1127 5658 with 3326 me 1700 one 3391 hour 5610? 

26:41 Watch 1127 5720 and 2532 pray 4336 5737, that 3363 0 ye enter 1525 5632 not 3363 into 1519 temptation 3986: the spirit 4151 indeed 3303 [is] willing 4289, but 1161 the flesh 4561 [is] weak 772. 

26:42 He went away 565 5631 again 3825 the 1537 second time 1208, and prayed 4336 5662, saying 3004 5723, O my 3450 Father 3962, if 1487 this 5124 cup 4221 may 1410 5736 not 3756 pass away 3928 5629 from 575 me 1700, except 3362 I drink 4095 5632 it 846, thy 4675 will 2307 be done 1096 5676. 

26:43 And 2532 he came 2064 5631 and found 2147 5719 them 846 asleep 2518 5723 again 3825: for 1063 their 846 eyes 3788 were 2258 5713 heavy 916 5772. 

26:44 And 2532 he left 863 5631 them 846, and went away 565 5631 again 3825, and prayed 4336 5662 1537 the third time 5154, saying 2036 5631 the same 846 words 3056. 

26:45 Then 5119 cometh he 2064 5736 to 4314 his 848 disciples 3101, and 2532 saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Sleep on 2518 5719 5720 now 3063, and 2532 take [your] rest 373 5731 5732: behold 2400 5628, the hour 5610 is at hand 1448 5758, and 2532 the Son 5207 of man 444 is betrayed 3860 5743 into 1519 the hands 5495 of sinners 268. 

26:46 Rise 1453 5728, let us be going 71 5725: behold 2400 5628, he is at hand 1448 5758 that doth betray 3860 5723 me 3165. 

26:47 And 2532 while 2089 0 he 846 yet 2089 spake 2980 5723, lo 2400 5628, Judas 2455, one 1520 of the twelve 1427, came 2064 5627, and 2532 with 3326 him 846 a great 4183 multitude 3793 with 3326 swords 3162 and 2532 staves 3586, from 575 the chief priests 749 and 2532 elders 4245 of the people 2992. 

26:48 Now 1161 he that betrayed 3860 5723 him 846 gave 1325 5656 them 846 a sign 4592, saying 3004 5723, Whomsoever 3739 302 I shall kiss 5368 5661, that same 846 is 2076 5748 he 846: hold 2902 0 him 846 fast 2902 5657. 

26:49 And 2532 forthwith 2112 he came 4334 5631 to Jesus 2424, and said 2036 5627, Hail 5463 5720, master 4461; and 2532 kissed 2705 5656 him 846. 

26:50 And 1161 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Friend 2083, wherefore 1909 3739 art thou 3739 come 3918 5748? Then 5119 came they 4334 5631, and laid 1911 5627 hands 5495 on 1909 Jesus 2424, and 2532 took 2902 5656 him 846. 

26:51 And 2532, behold 2400 5628, one 1520 of them which were with 3326 Jesus 2424 stretched out 1614 5660 [his] hand 5495, and drew 645 5656 his 848 sword 3162, and 2532 struck 3960 5660 a servant 1401 of the high priest's 749, and smote off 851 5627 his 846 ear 5621. 

26:52 Then 5119 said 3004 5719 Jesus 2424 unto him 846, Put up again 654 5657 thy 4675 sword 3162 into 1519 his 846 place 5117: for 1063 all they 3956 that take 2983 5631 the sword 3162 shall perish 622 5698 with 1722 the sword 3162. 

26:53 2228 Thinkest thou 1380 5719 that 3754 I cannot 3756 1410 5736 now 737 pray 3870 5658 to my 3450 Father 3962, and 2532 he shall presently give 3936 5692 me 3427 more 4119 than 2228 twelve 1427 legions 3003 of angels 32? 

26:54 But how 4459 then 3767 shall the scriptures 1124 be fulfilled 4137 5686, that 3754 thus 3779 it must 1163 5748 be 1096 5635? 

26:55 In 1722 that same 1565 hour 5610 said 2036 5627 Jesus 2424 to the multitudes 3793, Are ye come out 1831 5627 as 5613 against 1909 a thief 3027 with 3326 swords 3162 and 2532 staves 3586 for to take 4815 5629 me 3165? I sat 2516 5711 daily 2250 2596 with 4314 you 5209 teaching 1321 5723 in 1722 the temple 2411, and 2532 ye laid 2902 0 no 3756 hold 2902 5656 on me 3165. 

26:56 But 1161 all 3650 this 5124 was done 1096 5754, that 2443 the scriptures 1124 of the prophets 4396 might be fulfilled 4137 5686. Then 5119 all 3956 the disciples 3101 forsook 863 5631 him 846, and fled 5343 5627. 

26:57 And 1161 they that had laid hold 2902 5660 on Jesus 2424 led [him] away 520 5627 to 4314 Caiaphas 2533 the high priest 749, where 3699 the scribes 1122 and 2532 the elders 4245 were assembled 4863 5681. 

26:58 But 1161 Peter 4074 followed 190 5707 him 846 afar off 575 3113 unto 2193 the high priest's 749 palace 833, and 2532 went 1525 5631 in 2080, and sat 2521 5711 with 3326 the servants 5257, to see 1492 5629 the end 5056. 

26:59 Now 1161 the chief priests 749, and 2532 elders 4245, and 2532 all 3650 the council 4892, sought 2212 5707 false witness 5577 against 2596 Jesus 2424, to 3704 put 2289 0 him 846 to death 2289 5661; 

26:60 But 2532 found 2147 5627 none 3756: yea 2532, though many 4183 false witnesses 5575 came 4334 5631, [yet] found they 2147 5627 none 3756. 1161 At the last 5305 came 4334 5631 two 1417 false witnesses 5575, 

26:61 And said 2036 5627, This 3778 [fellow] said 5346 5713, I am able 1410 5736 to destroy 2647 5658 the temple 3485 of God 2316, and 2532 to build 3618 5658 it 846 in 1223 three 5140 days 2250. 

26:62 And 2532 the high priest 749 arose 450 5631, and said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Answerest thou 611 5736 nothing 3762? what 5101 [is it which] these 3778 witness against 2649 5719 thee 4675? 

26:63 But 1161 Jesus 2424 held his peace 4623 5707. And 2532 the high priest 749 answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627 unto him 846, I adjure 1844 5719 thee 4571 by 2596 the living 2198 5723 God 2316, that 2443 thou tell 2036 5632 us 2254 whether 1487 thou 4771 be 1488 5748 the Christ 5547, the Son 5207 of God 2316. 

26:64 Jesus 2424 saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, Thou 4771 hast said 2036 5627: nevertheless 4133 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, Hereafter 737 575 shall ye see 3700 5695 the Son 5207 of man 444 sitting 2521 5740 on 1537 the right hand 1188 of power 1411, and 2532 coming 2064 5740 in 1909 the clouds 3507 of heaven 3772. 

26:65 Then 5119 the high priest 749 rent 1284 5656 his 848 clothes 2440, saying 3004 5723, 3754 He hath spoken blasphemy 987 5656; what 5101 further 2089 need 5532 have we 2192 5719 of witnesses 3144? behold 2396, now 3568 ye have heard 191 5656 his 846 blasphemy 988. 

26:66 What 5101 think 1380 5719 ye 5213? They answered 611 5679 and 1161 said 2036 5627, He is 2076 5748 guilty 1777 of death 2288. 

26:67 Then 5119 did they spit 1716 5656 in 1519 his 846 face 4383, and 2532 buffeted 2852 5656 him 846; and 1161 others smote [him] with the palms of their hands 4474 5656, 

26:68 Saying 3004 5723, Prophesy 4395 5657 unto us 2254, thou Christ 5547, Who 5101 is he 2076 5748 that smote 3817 5660 thee 4571? 

26:69 Now 1161 Peter 4074 sat 2521 5711 without 1854 in 1722 the palace 833: and 2532 a 3391 damsel 3814 came 4334 5627 unto him 846, saying 3004 5723, Thou 4771 also 2532 wast 2258 5713 with 3326 Jesus 2424 of Galilee 1057. 

26:70 But 1161 he denied 720 5662 before 1715 [them] all 3956, saying 3004 5723, I know 1492 5758 not 3756 what 5101 thou sayest 3004 5719. 

26:71 And 1161 when he 846 was gone out 1831 5631 into 1519 the porch 4440, another 243 [maid] saw 1492 5627 him 846, and 2532 said 3004 5719 unto them that were there 1563, This 3778 [fellow] was 2258 5713 also 2532 with 3326 Jesus 2424 of Nazareth 3480. 

26:72 And 2532 again 3825 he denied 720 5662 with 3326 an oath 3727, 3754 I do 1492 0 not 3756 know 1492 5758 the man 444. 

26:73 And 1161 after 3326 a while 3397 came unto [him] they 4334 5631 that stood by 2476 5761, and said 2036 5627 to Peter 4074, Surely 230 thou 4771 also 2532 art 1488 5748 [one] of 1537 them 846; for 1063 2532 thy 4675 speech 2981 bewrayeth 1212 thee 4571 4160 5719. 

26:74 Then 5119 began he 756 5662 to curse 2653 5721 and 2532 to swear 3660 5721, [saying], 3754 I know 1492 5758 not 3756 the man 444. And 2532 immediately 2112 the cock 220 crew 5455 5656. 

26:75 And 2532 Peter 4074 remembered 3415 5681 the word 4487 of Jesus 2424, which 3588 said 2046 5761 unto him 846, Before 3754 4250 the cock 220 crow 5455 5658, thou shalt deny 533 5695 me 3165 thrice 5151. And 2532 he went out 1854, and 1831 5631 wept 2799 5656 bitterly 4090. 

27:1 When 1161 the morning 4405 was come 1096 5637, all 3956 the chief priests 749 and 2532 elders 4245 of the people 2992 took 2983 5627 counsel 4824 against 2596 Jesus 2424 to 5620 put 2289 0 him 846 to death 2289 5658: 

27:2 And 2532 when they had bound 1210 5660 him 846, they led [him] away 520 5627, and 2532 delivered 3860 5656 him 846 to Pontius 4194 Pilate 4091 the governor 2232. 

27:3 Then 5119 Judas 2455, which 3588 had betrayed 3860 5723 him 846, when he saw 1492 5631 that 3754 he was condemned 2632 5681, repented himself 3338 5679, and brought again 654 5656 the thirty 5144 pieces of silver 694 to the chief priests 749 and 2532 elders 4245, 

27:4 Saying 3004 5723, I have sinned 264 5627 in that I have betrayed 3860 5631 the innocent 121 blood 129. And 1161 they said 2036 5627, What 5101 [is that] to 4314 us 2248? see 3700 5695 thou 4771 [to that]. 

27:5 And 2532 he cast down 4496 5660 the pieces of silver 694 in 1722 the temple 3485, and 2532 departed 402 5656, and 2532 went 565 5631 and hanged himself 519 5668. 

27:6 And 1161 the chief priests 749 took 2983 5631 the silver pieces 694, and said 2036 5627, It is 1832 0 not 3756 lawful 1832 5748 for to put 906 5629 them 846 into 1519 the treasury 2878, because 1893 it is 2076 5748 the price 5092 of blood 129. 

27:7 And 1161 they took 2983 5631 counsel 4824, and bought 59 5656 with 1537 them 846 the potter's 2763 field 68, to 1519 bury 5027 0 strangers 3581 in 5027. 

27:8 Wherefore 1352 that 1565 field 68 was called 2564 5681, The field 68 of blood 129, unto 2193 this day 4594. 

27:9 Then 5119 was fulfilled 4137 5681 that which 3588 was spoken 4483 5685 by 1223 Jeremy 2408 the prophet 4396, saying 3004 5723, And 2532 they took 2983 5627 the thirty 5144 pieces of silver 694, the price 5092 of him that was valued 5091 5772, whom 3739 they of 575 the children 5207 of Israel 2474 did value 5091 5668; 

27:10 And 2532 gave 1325 5656 them 846 for 1519 the potter's 2763 field 68, as 2505 the Lord 2962 appointed 4929 5656 me 3427. 

27:11 And 1161 Jesus 2424 stood 2476 5627 before 1715 the governor 2232: and 2532 the governor 2232 asked 1905 5656 him 846, saying 3004 5723, Art 1488 5748 thou 4771 the King 935 of the Jews 2453? And 1161 Jesus 2424 said 5346 5713 unto him 846, Thou 4771 sayest 3004 5719. 

27:12 And 2532 when 1722 he was accused 2723 5745 of 5259 the chief priests 749 and 2532 elders 4245, he answered 611 5662 nothing 3762. 

27:13 Then 5119 said 3004 5719 Pilate 4091 unto him 846, Hearest thou 191 5719 not 3756 how many things 4214 they witness against 2649 5719 thee 4675? 

27:14 And 2532 he answered 3756 611 5662 him 846 to 4314 never 3761 a 1520 word 4487; insomuch 5620 that the governor 2232 marvelled 2296 5721 greatly 3029. 

27:15 Now 1161 at 2596 [that] feast 1859 the governor 2232 was wont 1486 5715 to release 630 5721 unto the people 3793 a 1520 prisoner 1198, whom 3739 they would 2309 5707. 

27:16 And 1161 they had 2192 5707 then 5119 a notable 1978 prisoner 1198, called 3004 5746 Barabbas 912. 

27:17 Therefore 3767 when they were gathered together 4863 5772, Pilate 4091 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Whom 5101 will ye 2309 5719 that I release 630 5661 unto you 5213? Barabbas 912, or 2228 Jesus 2424 which 3588 is called 3004 5746 Christ 5547? 

27:18 For 1063 he knew 1492 5715 that 3754 for 1223 envy 5355 they had delivered 3860 5656 him 846. 

27:19 When 1161 he 846 was set down 2521 5740 on 1909 the judgment seat 968, his 846 wife 1135 sent 649 5656 unto 4314 him 846, saying 3004 5723, 2532 Have thou 4671 nothing 3367 to do with that 1565 just man 1342: for 1063 I have suffered 3958 5627 many things 4183 this day 4594 in 2596 a dream 3677 because 1223 of him 846. 

27:20 But 1161 the chief priests 749 and 2532 elders 4245 persuaded 3982 5656 the multitude 3793 that 2443 they should ask 154 5672 Barabbas 912, and 1161 destroy 622 5661 Jesus 2424. 

27:21 The governor 2232 answered 611 5679 and 1161 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Whether 5101 of 575 the twain 1417 will ye 2309 5719 that I release 630 5661 unto you 5213? 1161 They said 2036 5627, Barabbas 912. 

27:22 Pilate 4091 saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, What 5101 shall I do 4160 5692 then 3767 with Jesus 2424 which 3588 is called 3004 5746 Christ 5547? [They] all 3956 say 3004 5719 unto him 846, Let him be crucified 4717 5682. 

27:23 And 1161 the governor 2232 said 5346 5713, Why 1063, what 5101 evil 2556 hath he done 4160 5656? But 1161 they cried out 2896 5707 the more 4057, saying 3004 5723, Let him be crucified 4717 5682. 

27:24 When 1161 Pilate 4091 saw 1492 5631 that 3754 he could prevail 5623 5719 nothing 3762, but 235 [that] rather 3123 a tumult 2351 was made 1096 5736, he took 2983 5631 water 5204, and washed 633 5668 [his] hands 5495 before 561 the multitude 3793, saying 3004 5723, I am 1510 5748 innocent 121 of 575 the blood 129 of this 5127 just person 1342: see 3700 5695 ye 5210 [to it]. 

27:25 Then 2532 answered 611 5679 all 3956 the people 2992, and said 2036 5627, His blood 129 [be] on 1909 us 2248, and 2532 on 1909 our 2257 children 5043. 

27:26 Then 5119 released he 630 5656 Barabbas 912 unto them 846: and 1161 when he had scourged 5417 5660 Jesus 2424, he delivered 3860 5656 [him] to 2443 be crucified 4717 5686. 

27:27 Then 5119 the soldiers 4757 of the governor 2232 took 3880 5631 Jesus 2424 into 1519 the common hall 4232, and gathered 4863 5627 unto 1909 him 846 the whole 3650 band 4686 [of soldiers]. 

27:28 And 2532 they stripped 1562 5660 him 846, and put on 4060 5656 him 846 a scarlet 2847 robe 5511. 

27:29 And 2532 when they had platted 4120 5660 a crown 4735 of 1537 thorns 173, they put 2007 5656 [it] upon 1909 his 846 head 2776, and 2532 a reed 2563 in 1909 his 846 right hand 1188: and 2532 they bowed the knee 1120 5660 before 1715 him 846, and mocked 1702 5707 him 846, saying 3004 5723, Hail 5463 5720, King 935 of the Jews 2453! 

27:30 And 2532 they spit 1716 5660 upon 1519 him 846, and took 2983 5627 the reed 2563, and 2532 smote 5180 5707 him 846 on 1519 the head 2776. 

27:31 And 2532 after 3753 that they had mocked 1702 5656 him 846, they took 1562 0 the robe 5511 off 1562 5656 from him 846, and 2532 put 1746 0 his own 846 raiment 2440 on 1746 5656 him 846, and 2532 led 520 0 him 846 away 520 5627 to 1519 crucify 4717 5658 [him]. 

27:32 And 1161 as they came out 1831 5740, they found 2147 5627 a man 444 of Cyrene 2956, Simon 4613 by name 3686: him 5126 they compelled 29 5656 to 2443 bear 142 5661 his 846 cross 4716. 

27:33 And 2532 when they were come 2064 5631 unto 1519 a place 5117 called 3004 5746 Golgotha 1115, that 3739 is 2076 5748 to say 3004 5746, a place 5117 of a skull 2898, 

27:34 They gave 1325 5656 him 846 vinegar 3690 to drink 4095 5629 mingled 3396 5772 with 3326 gall 5521: and 2532 when he had tasted 1089 5666 [thereof], he would 2309 5707 not 3756 drink 4095 5629. 

27:35 And 1161 they crucified 4717 5660 him 846, and parted 1266 5668 his 846 garments 2440, casting 906 5723 lots 2819: that 2443 it might be fulfilled 4137 5686 which 3588 was spoken 4483 5685 by 5259 the prophet 4396, They parted 1266 5668 my 3450 garments 2440 among them 1438, and 2532 upon 1909 my 3450 vesture 2441 did they cast 906 5627 lots 2819. 

27:36 And 2532 sitting down 2521 5740 they watched 5083 5707 him 846 there 1563; 

27:37 And 2532 set up 2007 5656 over 1883 his 846 head 2776 his 846 accusation 156 written 1125 5772, THIS 3778 IS 2076 5748 JESUS 2424 THE KING 935 OF THE JEWS 2453. 

27:38 Then 5119 were there two 1417 thieves 3027 crucified 4717 5743 with 4862 him 846, one 1520 on 1537 the right hand 1188, and 2532 another 1520 on 1537 the left 2176. 

27:39 And 1161 they that passed by 3899 5740 reviled 987 5707 him 846, wagging 2795 5723 their 848 heads 2776, 

27:40 And 2532 saying 3004 5723, Thou that destroyest 2647 5723 the temple 3485, and 2532 buildest 3618 5723 [it] in 1722 three 5140 days 2250, save 4982 5657 thyself 4572. If 1487 thou be 1488 5748 the Son 5207 of God 2316, come down 2597 5628 from 575 the cross 4716. 

27:41 1161 Likewise 3668 also 2532 the chief priests 749 mocking 1702 5723 [him], with 3326 the scribes 1122 and 2532 elders 4245, said 3004 5707, 

27:42 He saved 4982 5656 others 243; himself 1438 he cannot 3756 1410 5736 save 4982 5658. If 1487 he be 2076 5748 the King 935 of Israel 2474, let him 2597 0 now 3568 come down 2597 5628 from 575 the cross 4716, and 2532 we will believe 4100 5692 him 846. 

27:43 He trusted 3982 5754 in 1909 God 2316; let him deliver 4506 5663 him 846 now 3568, if 1487 he will have 2309 5719 him 846: for 1063 he said 2036 5627, 3754 I am 1510 5748 the Son 5207 of God 2316. 

27:44 1161 The thieves 3027 also 2532, which 3588 were crucified 4957 5685 with him 846, cast 3679 0 the same 846 in his teeth 3679 5707. 

27:45 Now 1161 from 575 the sixth 1623 hour 5610 there was 1096 5633 darkness 4655 over 1909 all 3956 the land 1093 unto 2193 the ninth 1766 hour 5610. 

27:46 And 1161 about 4012 the ninth 1766 hour 5610 Jesus 2424 cried 310 5656 with a loud 3173 voice 5456, saying 3004 5723, Eli 2241, Eli 2241, lama 2982 sabachthani 4518? that 5123 5748 is to say, My 3450 God 2316, my 3450 God 2316, why 2444 hast thou forsaken 1459 5627 me 3165? 

27:47 1161 Some of them 5100 that stood 2476 5761 there 1563, when they heard 191 5660 [that], said 3004 5707 3754, This 3778 [man] calleth for 5455 5719 Elias 2243. 

27:48 And 2532 straightway 2112 one 1520 of 1537 them 846 ran 5143 5631, and 2532 took 2983 5631 a spunge 4699, and 5037 filled 4130 5660 [it] with vinegar 3690, and 2532 put [it] on 4060 5631 a reed 2563, and gave 4222 0 him 846 to drink 4222 5707. 

27:49 The 1161 rest 3062 said 3004 5707, Let be 863 5628, let us see 1492 5632 whether 1487 Elias 2243 will come 2064 5736 to save 4982 5694 him 846. 

27:50 1161 Jesus 2424, when he had cried 2896 5660 again 3825 with a loud 3173 voice 5456, yielded up 863 5656 the ghost 4151. 

27:51 And 2532, behold 2400 5628, the veil 2665 of the temple 3485 was rent 4977 5681 in 1519 twain 1417 from 575 the top 509 to 2193 the bottom 2736; and 2532 the earth 1093 did quake 4579 5681, and 2532 the rocks 4073 rent 4977 5681; 

27:52 And 2532 the graves 3419 were opened 455 5681; and 2532 many 4183 bodies 4983 of the saints 40 which 3588 slept 2837 5772 arose 1453 5681, 

27:53 And 2532 came 1831 5631 out of 1537 the graves 3419 after 3326 his 846 resurrection 1454, and went 1525 5627 into 1519 the holy 40 city 4172, and 2532 appeared 1718 5681 unto many 4183. 

27:54 Now 1161 when the centurion 1543, and 2532 they that were with 3326 him 846, watching 5083 5723 Jesus 2424, saw 1492 5631 the earthquake 4578, and 2532 those things that were done 1096 5637, they feared 5399 5675 greatly 4970, saying 3004 5723, Truly 230 this 3778 was 2258 5713 the Son 5207 of God 2316. 

27:55 And 1161 many 4183 women 1135 were 2258 5713 there 1563 beholding 2334 5723 afar off 575 3113, which 3748 followed 190 5656 Jesus 2424 from 575 Galilee 1056, ministering 1247 5723 unto him 846: 

27:56 Among 1722 which 3739 was 2258 5713 Mary 3137 Magdalene 3094, and 2532 Mary 3137 the mother 3384 of James 2385 and 2532 Joses 2500, and 2532 the mother 3384 of Zebedee's 2199 children 5207. 

27:57 When 1161 the even 3798 was come 1096 5637, there came 2064 5627 a rich 4145 man 444 of 575 Arimathaea 707, named 3686 Joseph 2501 5122, who 3739 also 2532 himself 846 was 3100 0 Jesus 2424' disciple 3100 5656: 

27:58 He 3778 went 4334 5631 to Pilate 4091, and begged 154 5668 the body 4983 of Jesus 2424. Then 5119 Pilate 4091 commanded 2753 5656 the body 4983 to be delivered 591 5683. 

27:59 And 2532 when Joseph 2501 had taken 2983 5631 the body 4983, he wrapped 1794 5656 it 846 in a clean 2513 linen cloth 4616, 

27:60 And 2532 laid 5087 5656 it 846 in 1722 his own 848 new 2537 tomb 3419, which 3739 he had hewn out 2998 5656 in 1722 the rock 4073: and 2532 he rolled 4351 5660 a great 3173 stone 3037 to the door 2374 of the sepulchre 3419, and departed 565 5627. 

27:61 And 1161 there 1563 was 2258 5713 Mary 3137 Magdalene 3094, and 2532 the other 243 Mary 3137, sitting 2521 5740 over against 561 the sepulchre 5028. 

27:62 Now 1161 the next day 1887, that 3748 followed 2076 5748 3326 the day of the preparation 3904, the chief priests 749 and 2532 Pharisees 5330 came together 4863 5681 unto 4314 Pilate 4091, 

27:63 Saying 3004 5723, Sir 2962, we remember 3415 5681 that 3754 that 1565 deceiver 4108 said 2036 5627, while he was yet 2089 alive 2198 5723, After 3326 three 5140 days 2250 I will rise again 1453 5743. 

27:64 Command 2753 5657 therefore 3767 that the sepulchre 5028 be made sure 805 5683 until 2193 the third 5154 day 2250, lest 3379 his 846 disciples 3101 come 2064 5631 by night 3571, and steal 2813 0 him 846 away 2813 5661, and 2532 say 2036 5632 unto the people 2992, He is risen 1453 5681 from 575 the dead 3498: so 2532 the last 2078 error 4106 shall be 2071 5704 worse than 5501 the first 4413. 

27:65 1161 Pilate 4091 said 5346 5713 unto them 846, Ye have 2192 5719 a watch 2892: go your way 5217 5720, make [it] as sure 805 5663 as 5613 ye can 1492 5758. 

27:66 So 1161 they went 4198 5679, and made 805 0 the sepulchre 5028 sure 805 5662, sealing 4972 5660 the stone 3037, and setting 3326 a watch 2892. 

28:1 In the end 1161 3796 of the sabbath 4521, as it began to dawn 2020 5723 toward 1519 the first 3391 [day] of the week 4521, came 2064 5627 Mary 3137 Magdalene 3094 and 2532 the other 243 Mary 3137 to see 2334 5658 the sepulchre 5028. 

28:2 And 2532, behold 2400 5628, there was 1096 5633 a great 3173 earthquake 4578: for 1063 the angel 32 of the Lord 2962 descended 2597 5631 from 1537 heaven 3772, and came 4334 5631 and rolled back 617 5656 the stone 3037 from 575 the door 2374, and 2532 sat 2521 5711 upon 1883 it 846. 

28:3 His 1161 countenance 2397 was 2258 5713 like 5613 lightning 796, and 2532 his 846 raiment 1742 white 3022 as 5616 snow 5510: 

28:4 And 1161 for 575 fear 5401 of him 846 the keepers 5083 5723 did shake 4579 5681, and 2532 became 1096 5633 as 5616 dead 3498 [men]. 

28:5 And 1161 the angel 32 answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627 unto the women 1135, Fear 5399 5737 not 3361 ye 5210: for 1063 I know 1492 5758 that 3754 ye seek 2212 5719 Jesus 2424, which 3588 was crucified 4717 5772. 

28:6 He is 2076 5748 not 3756 here 5602: for 1063 he is risen 1453 5681, as 2531 he said 2036 5627. Come 1205 5773, see 1492 5628 the place 5117 where 3699 the Lord 2962 lay 2749 5711. 

28:7 And 2532 go 4198 5679 quickly 5035, and tell 2036 5628 his 846 disciples 3101 that 3754 he is risen 1453 5681 from 575 the dead 3498; and 2532, behold 2400 5628, he goeth before 4254 5719 you 5209 into 1519 Galilee 1056; there 1563 shall ye see 3700 5695 him 846: lo 2400 5628, I have told 2036 5627 you 5213. 

28:8 And 2532 they departed 1831 5631 quickly 5035 from 575 the sepulchre 3419 with 3326 fear 5401 and 2532 great 3173 joy 5479; and did run 5143 5627 to bring 518 0 his 846 disciples 3101 word 518 5658. 

28:9 And 1161 as 5613 they went 4198 5711 to tell 518 5658 his 846 disciples 3101, 2532 behold 2400 5628, Jesus 2424 met 528 5656 them 846, saying 3004 5723, All hail 5463 5720. And 1161 they came 4334 5631 and 1161 held 2902 5656 him 846 by the feet 4228, and 2532 worshipped 4352 5656 him 846. 

28:10 Then 5119 said 3004 5719 Jesus 2424 unto them 846, Be 5399 0 not 3361 afraid 5399 5737: go 565 5632 tell 518 5657 my 3450 brethren 80 that 2443 they go 5217 5720 into 1519 Galilee 1056, and there 2546 shall they see 3700 5695 me 3165. 

28:11 Now 1161 when they were going 4198 5740, behold 2400 5628, some 5100 of the watch 2892 came 2064 5631 into 1519 the city 4172, and shewed 518 5656 unto the chief priests 749 all the things 537 that were done 1096 5637. 

28:12 And 2532 when they were assembled 4863 5685 with 3326 the elders 4245, and 5037 had taken 2983 5631 counsel 4824, they gave 1325 5656 large 2425 money 694 unto the soldiers 4757, 

28:13 Saying 3004 5723, Say ye 2036 5628, 3754 His 846 disciples 3101 came 2064 5631 by night 3571, and stole 2813 5656 him 846 [away] while we 2257 slept 2837 5746. 

28:14 And 2532 if 1437 this 5124 come 191 0 to 1909 the governor's 2232 ears 191 5686, we 2249 will persuade 3982 5692 him 846, and 2532 secure 275 4160 5692 you 5209. 

28:15 So 1161 they took 2983 5631 the money 694, and did 4160 5656 as 5613 they were taught 1321 5681: and 2532 this 3778 saying 3056 is commonly reported 1310 5681 among 3844 the Jews 2453 until 3360 this day 4594. 

28:16 Then 1161 the eleven 1733 disciples 3101 went away 4198 5675 into 1519 Galilee 1056, into 1519 a mountain 3735 where 3757 Jesus 2424 had appointed 5021 5668 them 846. 

28:17 And 2532 when they saw 1492 5631 him 846, they worshipped 4352 5656 him 846: but 1161 some doubted 1365 5656. 

28:18 And 2532 Jesus 2424 came 4334 5631 and spake 2980 5656 unto them 846, saying 3004 5723, All 3956 power 1849 is given 1325 5681 unto me 3427 in 1722 heaven 3772 and 2532 in 1909 earth 1093. 

28:19 Go ye 4198 5679 therefore 3767, and teach 3100 5657 all 3956 nations 1484, baptizing 907 5723 them 846 in 1519 the name 3686 of the Father 3962, and 2532 of the Son 5207, and 2532 of the Holy 40 Ghost 4151: 

28:20 Teaching 1321 5723 them 846 to observe 5083 5721 all things 3956 whatsoever 3745 I have commanded 1781 5662 you 5213: and 2532, lo 2400 5628, I 1473 am 1510 5748 with 3326 you 5216 alway 3956 2250, [even] unto 2193 the end 4930 of the world 165. Amen 281.
