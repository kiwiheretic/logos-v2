1:1 The Revelation 602 of Jesus 2424 Christ 5547, which 3739 God 2316 gave 1325 5656 unto him 846, to shew 1166 5658 unto his 848 servants 1401 things which 3739 must 1163 5748 shortly 1722 5034 come to pass 1096 5635; and 2532 he sent 649 5660 and signified 4591 5656 [it] by 1223 his 848 angel 32 unto his 848 servant 1401 John 2491: 

1:2 Who 3739 bare record 3140 5656 of the word 3056 of God 2316, and 2532 of the testimony 3141 of Jesus 2424 Christ 5547, and 5037 of all things 3745 that he saw 1492 5627. 

1:3 Blessed 3107 [is] he that readeth 314 5723, and 2532 they that hear 191 5723 the words 3056 of this prophecy 4394, and 2532 keep 5083 5723 those things which are written 1125 5772 therein 1722 846: for 1063 the time 2540 [is] at hand 1451. 

1:4 John 2491 to the seven 2033 churches 1577 which 3588 are in 1722 Asia 773: Grace 5485 [be] unto you 5213, and 2532 peace 1515, from 575 him which 3588 is 2258 5713 3801, and 2532 which 3588 was 3801, and 2532 which 3588 is 3801 to come 2064 5740; and 2532 from 575 the seven 2033 Spirits 4151 which 3739 are 2076 5748 before 1799 his 846 throne 2362; 

1:5 And 2532 from 575 Jesus 2424 Christ 5547, [who is] the faithful 4103 witness 3144, [and] the first begotten 4416 of 1537 the dead 3498, and 2532 the prince 758 of the kings 935 of the earth 1093. Unto him that loved 25 5660 us 2248, and 2532 washed 3068 5660 us 2248 from 575 our 2257 sins 266 in 1722 his own 848 blood 129, 

1:6 And 2532 hath made 4160 5656 us 2248 kings 935 and 2532 priests 2409 unto God 2316 and 2532 his 848 Father 3962; to him 846 [be] glory 1391 and 2532 dominion 2904 for 1519 ever 165 and ever 165. Amen 281. 

1:7 Behold 2400 5628, he cometh 2064 5736 with 3326 clouds 3507; and 2532 every 3956 eye 3788 shall see 3700 5695 him 846, and 2532 they [also] which 3748 pierced 1574 5656 him 846: and 2532 all 3956 kindreds 5443 of the earth 1093 shall wail 2875 5695 because 1909 of him 846. Even so 3483, Amen 281. 

1:8 I 1473 am 1510 5748 Alpha 1 and 2532 Omega 5598, the beginning 746 and 2532 the ending 5056, saith 3004 5719 the Lord 2962, which 3588 is 3801, and 2532 which 3588 was 2258 5713 3801, and 2532 which 3588 is 3801 to come 2064 5740, the Almighty 3841. 

1:9 I 1473 John 2491, who 3588 also 2532 am your 5216 brother 80, and 2532 companion 4791 in 1722 tribulation 2347, and 2532 in 1722 the kingdom 932 and 2532 patience 5281 of Jesus 2424 Christ 5547, was 1096 5633 in 1722 the isle 3520 that is called 2564 5746 Patmos 3963, for 1223 the word 3056 of God 2316, and 2532 for 1223 the testimony 3141 of Jesus 2424 Christ 5547. 

1:10 I was 1096 5633 in 1722 the Spirit 4151 on 1722 the Lord's 2960 day 2250, and 2532 heard 191 5656 behind 3694 me 3450 a great 3173 voice 5456, as 5613 of a trumpet 4536, 

1:11 Saying 3004 5723, I 1473 am 1510 5748 Alpha 1 and 2532 Omega 5598, the first 4413 and 2532 the last 2078: and 2532, What 3739 thou seest 991 5719, write 1125 5657 in 1519 a book 975, and 2532 send 3992 5657 [it] unto the seven 2033 churches 1577 which 3588 are in 1722 Asia 773; unto 1519 Ephesus 2181, and 2532 unto 1519 Smyrna 4667, and 2532 unto 1519 Pergamos 4010, and 2532 unto 1519 Thyatira 2363, and 2532 unto 1519 Sardis 4554, and 2532 unto 1519 Philadelphia 5359, and 2532 unto 1519 Laodicea 2993. 

1:12 And 2532 I turned 1994 5656 to see 991 5721 the voice 5456 that 3748 spake 2980 5656 with 3326 me 1700. And 2532 being turned 1994 5660, I saw 1492 5627 seven 2033 golden 5552 candlesticks 3087; 

1:13 And 2532 in 1722 the midst 3319 of the seven 2033 candlesticks 3087 [one] like 3664 unto the Son 5207 of man 444, clothed with a garment 1746 5765 down to the foot 4158, and 2532 girt 4024 5772 about 4314 the paps 3149 with a golden 5552 girdle 2223. 

1:14 His 1161 head 2776 and 2532 [his] hairs 2359 [were] white 3022 like 5616 wool 2053, as white 3022 as 5613 snow 5510; and 2532 his 846 eyes 3788 [were] as 5613 a flame 5395 of fire 4442; 

1:15 And 2532 his 846 feet 4228 like 3664 unto fine brass 5474, as 5613 if they burned 4448 5772 in 1722 a furnace 2575; and 2532 his 846 voice 5456 as 5613 the sound 5456 of many 4183 waters 5204. 

1:16 And 2532 he had 2192 5723 in 1722 his 848 right 1188 hand 5495 seven 2033 stars 792: and 2532 out of 1537 his 846 mouth 4750 went 1607 5740 a sharp 3691 twoedged 1366 sword 4501: and 2532 his 846 countenance 3799 [was] as 5613 the sun 2246 shineth 5316 5719 in 1722 his 848 strength 1411. 

1:17 And 2532 when 3753 I saw 1492 5627 him 846, I fell 4098 5627 at 4314 his 846 feet 4228 as 5613 dead 3498. And 2532 he laid 2007 5656 his 848 right 1188 hand 5495 upon 1909 me 1691, saying 3004 5723 unto me 3427, Fear 5399 5732 5737 not 3361; I 1473 am 1510 5748 the first 4413 and 2532 the last 2078: 

1:18 2532 I [am] he that liveth 2198 5723, and 2532 was 1096 5633 dead 3498; and 2532, behold 2400 5628, I am 1510 5748 alive 2198 5723 for 1519 evermore 165 165, Amen 281; and 2532 have 2192 5719 the keys 2807 of hell 86 and 2532 of death 2288. 

1:19 Write 1125 5657 the things which 3739 thou hast seen 1492 5627, and 2532 the things which 3739 are 1526 5748, and 2532 the things which 3739 shall 3195 5719 be 1096 5738 hereafter 3326 5023; 

1:20 The mystery 3466 of the seven 2033 stars 792 which 3739 thou sawest 1492 5627 in 1909 my 3450 right hand 1188, and 2532 the seven 2033 golden 5552 candlesticks 3087. The seven 2033 stars 792 are 1526 5748 the angels 32 of the seven 2033 churches 1577: and 2532 the seven 2033 candlesticks 3087 which 3739 thou sawest 1492 5627 are 1526 5748 the seven 2033 churches 1577. 

2:1 Unto the angel 32 of the church 1577 of Ephesus 2179 write 1125 5657; These things 3592 saith 3004 5719 he that holdeth 2902 5723 the seven 2033 stars 792 in 1722 his 848 right hand 1188, who 3588 walketh 4043 5723 in 1722 the midst 3319 of the seven 2033 golden 5552 candlesticks 3087; 

2:2 I know 1492 5758 thy 4675 works 2041, and 2532 thy 4675 labour 2873, and 2532 thy 4675 patience 5281, and 2532 how 3754 thou canst 1410 5736 not 3756 bear 941 5658 them which are evil 2556: and 2532 thou hast tried 3985 5668 them which say 5335 5723 they are 1511 5750 apostles 652, and 2532 are 1526 5748 not 3756, and 2532 hast found 2147 5627 them 846 liars 5571: 

2:3 And 2532 hast borne 941 5656, and 2532 hast 2192 5719 patience 5281, and 2532 for 1223 0 my 3450 name's sake 1223 3686 hast laboured 2872 5758, and 2532 hast 2577 0 not 3756 fainted 2577 5758. 

2:4 Nevertheless 235 I have 2192 5719 [somewhat] against 2596 thee 4675, because 3754 thou hast left 863 5656 thy 4675 first 4413 love 26. 

2:5 Remember 3421 5720 therefore 3767 from whence 4159 thou art fallen 1601 5758, and 2532 repent 3340 5657, and 2532 do 4160 5657 the first 4413 works 2041; or else 1490 I will come 2064 5736 unto thee 4671 quickly 5035, and 2532 will remove 2795 5692 thy 4675 candlestick 3087 out of 1537 his 846 place 5117, except 3362 thou repent 3340 5661. 

2:6 But 235 this 5124 thou hast 2192 5719, that 3754 thou hatest 3404 5719 the deeds 2041 of the Nicolaitans 3531, which 3739 I also 2504 hate 3404 5719. 

2:7 He that hath 2192 5723 an ear 3775, let him hear 191 5657 what 5101 the Spirit 4151 saith 3004 5719 unto the churches 1577; To him 846 that overcometh 3528 5723 will I give 1325 5692 to eat 5315 5629 of 1537 the tree 3586 of life 2222, which 3739 is 2076 5748 in 1722 the midst 3319 of the paradise 3857 of God 2316. 

2:8 And 2532 unto the angel 32 of the church 1577 in Smyrna 4668 write 1125 5657; These things 3592 saith 3004 5719 the first 4413 and 2532 the last 2078, which 3739 was 1096 5633 dead 3498, and 2532 is alive 2198 5656; 

2:9 I know 1492 5758 thy 4675 works 2041, and 2532 tribulation 2347, and 2532 poverty 4432, (but 1161 thou art 1488 5748 rich 4145) and 2532 [I know] the blasphemy 988 of them which 3588 say 3004 5723 they 1438 are 1511 5750 Jews 2453, and 2532 are 1526 5748 not 3756, but 235 [are] the synagogue 4864 of Satan 4567. 

2:10 Fear 5399 5732 5737 none 3367 of those things which 3739 thou shalt 3195 5719 suffer 3958 5721: behold 2400 5628, the devil 1228 shall 3195 5719 cast 906 5629 [some] of 1537 you 5216 into 1519 prison 5438, that 2443 ye may be tried 3985 5686; and 2532 ye shall have 2192 5692 tribulation 2347 ten 1176 days 2250: be thou 1096 5737 faithful 4103 unto 891 death 2288, and 2532 I will give 1325 5692 thee 4671 a crown 4735 of life 2222. 

2:11 He that hath 2192 5723 an ear 3775, let him hear 191 5657 what 5101 the Spirit 4151 saith 3004 5719 unto the churches 1577; He that overcometh 3528 5723 shall 91 0 not 3364 be hurt 91 5686 of 1537 the second 1208 death 2288. 

2:12 And 2532 to the angel 32 of the church 1577 in 1722 Pergamos 4010 write 1125 5657; These things 3592 saith 3004 5719 he which hath 2192 5723 the sharp 3691 sword 4501 with two edges 1366; 

2:13 I know 1492 5758 thy 4675 works 2041, and 2532 where 4226 thou dwellest 2730 5719, [even] where 3699 Satan's 4567 seat 2362 [is]: and 2532 thou holdest fast 2902 5719 my 3450 name 3686, and 2532 hast 720 0 not 3756 denied 720 5662 my 3450 faith 4102, even 2532 in 1722 those days 2250 wherein 1722 3739 Antipas 493 [was] my 3450 faithful 4103 martyr 3144, who 3739 was slain 615 5681 among 3844 you 5213, where 3699 Satan 4567 dwelleth 2730 5719. 

2:14 But 235 I have 2192 5719 a few things 3641 against 2596 thee 4675, because 3754 thou hast 2192 5719 there 1563 them that hold 2902 5723 the doctrine 1322 of Balaam 903, who 3739 taught 1722 1321 5707 Balac 904 to cast 906 5629 a stumblingblock 4625 before 1799 the children 5207 of Israel 2474, to eat 5315 5629 things sacrificed unto idols 1494, and 2532 to commit fornication 4203 5658. 

2:15 So 3779 hast 2192 5719 thou 4771 also 2532 them that hold 2902 5723 the doctrine 1322 of the Nicolaitans 3531, which thing 3739 I hate 3404 5719. 

2:16 Repent 3340 5657; or else 1490 I will come 2064 5736 unto thee 4671 quickly 5035, and 2532 will fight 4170 5692 against 3326 them 846 with 1722 the sword 4501 of my 3450 mouth 4750. 

2:17 He that hath 2192 5723 an ear 3775, let him hear 191 5657 what 5101 the Spirit 4151 saith 3004 5719 unto the churches 1577; To him 846 that overcometh 3528 5723 will I give 1325 5692 to eat 5315 5629 of 575 1537 the hidden 2928 5772 manna 3131, and 2532 will give 1325 5692 him 846 a white 3022 stone 5586, and 2532 in 1909 the stone 5586 a new 2537 name 3686 written 1125 5772, which 3739 no man 3762 knoweth 1097 5627 saving 1508 he that receiveth 2983 5723 [it]. 

2:18 And 2532 unto the angel 32 of the church 1577 in 1722 Thyatira 2363 write 1125 5657; These things 3592 saith 3004 5719 the Son 5207 of God 2316, who 3588 hath 2192 5723 his 848 eyes 3788 like 5613 unto a flame 5395 of fire 4442, and 2532 his 846 feet 4228 [are] like 3664 fine brass 5474; 

2:19 I know 1492 5758 thy 4675 works 2041, and 2532 charity 26, and 2532 service 1248, and 2532 faith 4102, and 2532 thy 4675 patience 5281, and 2532 thy 4675 works 2041; and 2532 the last 2078 [to be] more than 4119 the first 4413. 

2:20 Notwithstanding 235 I have 2192 5719 a few things 3641 against 2596 thee 4675, because 3754 thou sufferest 1439 5719 that woman 1135 Jezebel 2403, which 3588 calleth 3004 5723 herself 1438 a prophetess 4398, to teach 1321 5721 and 2532 to seduce 4105 5745 my 1699 servants 1401 to commit fornication 4203 5658, and 2532 to eat 5315 5629 things sacrificed unto idols 1494. 

2:21 And 2532 I gave 1325 5656 her 846 space 5550 to 2443 repent 3340 5661 of 1537 her 848 fornication 4202; and 2532 she repented 3340 5656 not 3756. 

2:22 Behold 2400 5628, I 1473 will cast 906 5719 her 846 into 1519 a bed 2825, and 2532 them that commit adultery 3431 5723 with 3326 her 846 into 1519 great 3173 tribulation 2347, except 3362 they repent 3340 5661 of 1537 their 848 deeds 2041. 

2:23 And 2532 I will kill 615 5692 her 846 children 5043 with 1722 death 2288; and 2532 all 3956 the churches 1577 shall know 1097 5695 that 3754 I 1473 am 1510 5748 he which 3588 searcheth 2045 5723 the reins 3510 and 2532 hearts 2588: and 2532 I will give 1325 5692 unto every one 1538 of you 5213 according to 2596 your 5216 works 2041. 

2:24 But 1161 unto you 5213 I say 3004 5719, and 2532 unto the rest 3062 in 1722 Thyatira 2363, as many as 3745 have 2192 5719 not 3756 this 5026 doctrine 1322, and 2532 which 3748 have 1097 0 not 3756 known 1097 5627 the depths 899 of Satan 4567, as 5613 they speak 3004 5719; I will put 906 5692 upon 1909 you 5209 none 3756 other 243 burden 922. 

2:25 But 4133 that which ye have 2192 5719 [already] hold fast 2902 5657 till 891 3739 I come 302 2240 5661. 

2:26 And 2532 he that overcometh 3528 5723, and 2532 keepeth 5083 5723 my 3450 works 2041 unto 891 the end 5056, to him 846 will I give 1325 5692 power 1849 over 1909 the nations 1484: 

2:27 And 2532 he shall rule 4165 5692 them 846 with 1722 a rod 4464 of iron 4603; as 5613 the vessels 4632 of a potter 2764 shall they be broken to shivers 4937 5743: even 2504 0 as 5613 I 2504 received 2983 5758 of 3844 my 3450 Father 396 . 

2:28 And 2532 I will give 1325 5692 him 846 the morning 4407 star 79 . 

2:29 He that hath 2192 5723 an ear 3775, let him hear 191 5657 what 5101 the Spirit 4151 saith 3004 5719 unto the churches 1577. 

3:1 And 2532 unto the angel 32 of the church 1577 in 1722 Sardis 4554 write 1125 5657; These things 3592 saith 3004 5719 he that hath 2192 5723 the seven 2033 Spirits 4151 of God 2316, and 2532 the seven 2033 stars 792; I know 1492 5758 thy 4675 works 2041, that 3754 thou hast 2192 5719 a name 3686 that 3754 thou livest 2198 5719, and 2532 art 1488 5748 dead 3498. 

3:2 Be 1096 5737 watchful 1127 5723, and 2532 strengthen 4741 5657 the things which remain 3062, that 3739 are 3195 5719 ready to die 599 5629: for 1063 I have 2147 0 not 3756 found 2147 5758 thy 4675 works 2041 perfect 4137 5772 before 1799 God 2316. 

3:3 Remember 3421 5720 therefore 3767 how 4459 thou hast received 2983 5758 and 2532 heard 191 5656, and 2532 hold fast 5083 5720, and 2532 repent 3340 5657. If 3362 0 therefore 3767 thou shalt 1127 0 not 3362 watch 1127 5661, I will come 2240 5692 on 1909 thee 4571 as 5613 a thief 2812, and 2532 thou shalt 1097 0 not 3364 know 1097 5632 what 4169 hour 5610 I will come 2240 5692 upon 1909 thee 4571. 

3:4 Thou hast 2192 5719 a few 3641 names 3686 even 2532 in 1722 Sardis 4554 which 3739 have 3435 0 not 3756 defiled 3435 5656 their 848 garments 2440; and 2532 they shall walk 4043 5692 with 3326 me 1700 in 1722 white 3022: for 3754 they are 1526 5748 worthy 514. 

3:5 He that overcometh 3528 5723, the same 3778 shall be clothed 4016 5698 in 1722 white 3022 raiment 2440; and 2532 I will 1813 0 not 3364 blot out 1813 5692 his 846 name 3686 out of 1537 the book 976 of life 2222, but 2532 I will confess 1843 5698 his 846 name 3686 before 1799 my 3450 Father 3962, and 2532 before 1799 his 846 angels 32. 

3:6 He that hath 2192 5723 an ear 3775, let him hear 191 5657 what 5101 the Spirit 4151 saith 3004 5719 unto the churches 1577. 

3:7 And 2532 to the angel 32 of the church 1577 in 1722 Philadelphia 5359 write 1125 5657; These things 3592 saith 3004 5719 he that is holy 40, he that is true 228, he that hath 2192 5723 the key 2807 of David 1138, he that openeth 455 5723, and 2532 no man 3762 shutteth 2808 5719; and 2532 shutteth 2808 5719, and 2532 no man 3762 openeth 455 5719; 

3:8 I know 1492 5758 thy 4675 works 2041: behold 2400 5628, I have set 1325 5758 before 1799 thee 4675 an open 455 5772 door 2374, and 2532 no man 3762 can 1410 5736 shut 2808 5658 it 846: for 3754 thou hast 2192 5719 a little 3398 strength 1411, and 2532 hast kept 5083 5656 my 3450 word 3056, and 2532 hast 720 0 not 3756 denied 720 5662 my 3450 name 3686. 

3:9 Behold 2400 5628, I will make 1325 5719 them of 1537 the synagogue 4864 of Satan 4567, which 3588 say 3004 5723 they 1438 are 1511 5750 Jews 2453, and 2532 are 1526 5748 not 3756, but 235 do lie 5574 5727; behold 2400 5628, I will make 4160 5692 them 846 to 2443 come 2240 5661 and 2532 worship 4352 5661 before 1799 thy 4675 feet 4228, and 2532 to know 1097 5632 that 3754 I 1473 have loved 25 5656 thee 4571. 

3:10 Because 3754 thou hast kept 5083 5656 the word 3056 of my 3450 patience 5281, I also 2504 will keep 5083 5692 thee 4571 from 1537 the hour 5610 of temptation 3986, which 3588 shall come 3195 5723 2064 5738 upon 1909 all 3650 the world 3625, to try 3985 5658 them that dwell 2730 5723 upon 1909 the earth 1093. 

3:11 Behold 2400 5628, I come 2064 5736 quickly 5035: hold that fast 2902 5720 which 3739 thou hast 2192 5719, that 2443 no man 3367 take 2983 5632 thy 4675 crown 4735. 

3:12 Him 846 that overcometh 3528 5723 will I make 4160 5692 a pillar 4769 in 1722 the temple 3485 of my 3450 God 2316, and 2532 he shall go 1831 5632 no 3364 more 2089 out 1854: and 2532 I will write 1125 5692 upon 1909 him 846 the name 3686 of my 3450 God 2316, and 2532 the name 3686 of the city 4172 of my 3450 God 2316, [which is 3588] new 2537 Jerusalem 2419, which 3588 cometh down 2597 5723 5625 2597 5719 out of 1537 heaven 3772 from 575 my 3450 God 2316: and 2532 [I will write upon him] my 3450 new 2537 name 3686. 

3:13 He that hath 2192 5723 an ear 3775, let him hear 191 5657 what 5101 the Spirit 4151 saith 3004 5719 unto the churches 1577. 

3:14 And 2532 unto the angel 32 of the church 1577 of the Laodiceans 2994 write 1125 5657; These things 3592 saith 3004 5719 the Amen 281, the faithful 4103 and 2532 true 228 witness 3144, the beginning 746 of the creation 2937 of God 2316; 

3:15 I know 1492 5758 thy 4675 works 2041, that 3754 thou art 1488 5748 neither 3777 cold 5593 nor 3777 hot 2200: I would 3785 thou wert 1498 5751 cold 5593 or 2228 hot 2200. 

3:16 So 3779 then because 3754 thou art 1488 5748 lukewarm 5513, and 2532 neither 3777 cold 5593 nor 3777 hot 2200, I will 3195 5719 spue 1692 5658 thee 4571 out of 1537 my 3450 mouth 4750. 

3:17 Because 3754 thou sayest 3004 5719, 3754 I am 1510 5748 rich 4145, and 2532 increased with goods 4147 5758, and 2532 have 2192 5719 need 5532 of nothing 3762; and 2532 knowest 1492 5758 not 3756 that 3754 thou 4771 art 1488 5748 wretched 5005, and 2532 miserable 1652, and 2532 poor 4434, and 2532 blind 5185, and 2532 naked 1131: 

3:18 I counsel 4823 5719 thee 4671 to buy 59 5658 of 3844 me 1700 gold 5553 tried 4448 5772 in 1537 the fire 4442, that 2443 thou mayest be rich 4147 5661; and 2532 white 3022 raiment 2440, that 2443 thou mayest be clothed 4016 5643, and 2532 [that] the shame 152 of thy 4675 nakedness 1132 do 5319 0 not 3361 appear 5319 5686; and 2532 anoint 1472 5657 thine 4675 eyes 3788 with eyesalve 2854, that 2443 thou mayest see 991 5725. 

3:19 As many as 3745 1437 I love 5368 5725, I 1473 rebuke 1651 5719 and 2532 chasten 3811 5719: be zealous 2206 5657 therefore 3767, and 2532 repent 3340 5657. 

3:20 Behold 2400 5628, I stand 2476 5758 at 1909 the door 2374, and 2532 knock 2925 5719: if 1437 any man 5100 hear 191 5661 my 3450 voice 5456, and 2532 open 455 5661 the door 2374, I will come in 1525 5695 to 4314 him 846, and 2532 will sup 1172 5692 with 3326 him 846, and 2532 he 846 with 3326 me 1700. 

3:21 To him 846 that overcometh 3528 5723 will I grant 1325 5692 to sit 2523 5658 with 3326 me 1700 in 1722 my 3450 throne 2362, even 2504 0 as 5613 I also 2504 overcame 3528 5656, and 2532 am set down 2523 5656 with 3326 my 3450 Father 3962 in 1722 his 846 throne 2362. 

3:22 He that hath 2192 5723 an ear 3775, let him hear 191 5657 what 5101 the Spirit 4151 saith 3004 5719 unto the churches 1577. 

4:1 After 3326 this 5023 I looked 1492 5627, and 2532, behold 2400 5628, a door 2374 [was] opened 455 5772 in 1722 heaven 3772: and 2532 the first 4413 voice 5456 which 3739 I heard 191 5656 [was] as it were of 5613 a trumpet 4536 talking 2980 5723 with 3326 me 1700; which said 3004 5723, Come up 305 5628 hither 5602, and 2532 I will shew 1166 5692 thee 4671 things which 3739 must 1163 5748 be 1096 5635 hereafter 3326 5023. 

4:2 And 2532 immediately 2112 I was 1096 5633 in 1722 the spirit 4151: and 2532, behold 2400 5628, a throne 2362 was set 2749 5711 in 1722 heaven 3772, and 2532 [one] sat 2521 5740 on 1909 the throne 2362. 

4:3 And 2532 he that sat 2521 5740 was 2258 5713 to look upon 3706 like 3664 a jasper 2393 and 2532 a sardine 4555 stone 3037: and 2532 [there was] a rainbow 2463 round about 2943 the throne 2362, in sight 3706 like 3664 unto an emerald 4664. 

4:4 And 2532 round about 2943 the throne 2362 [were] four 5064 and 2532 twenty 1501 seats 2362: and 2532 upon 1909 the seats 2362 I saw 1492 5627 four 5064 and 2532 twenty 1501 elders 4245 sitting 2521 5740, clothed 4016 5772 in 1722 white 3022 raiment 2440; and 2532 they had 2192 5627 on 1909 their 848 heads 2776 crowns 4735 of gold 5552. 

4:5 And 2532 out of 1537 the throne 2362 proceeded 1607 5736 lightnings 796 and 2532 thunderings 1027 and 2532 voices 5456: and 2532 [there were] seven 2033 lamps 2985 of fire 4442 burning 2545 5746 before 1799 the throne 2362, which 3739 are 1526 5748 the seven 2033 Spirits 4151 of God 2316. 

4:6 And 2532 before 1799 the throne 2362 [there was] a sea 2281 of glass 5193 like 3664 unto crystal 2930: and 2532 in 1722 the midst 3319 of the throne 2362, and 2532 round about 2945 the throne 2362, [were] four 5064 beasts 2226 full 1073 5723 of eyes 3788 before 1715 and 2532 behind 3693. 

4:7 And 2532 the first 4413 beast 2226 [was] like 3664 a lion 3023, and 2532 the second 1208 beast 2226 like 3664 a calf 3448, and 2532 the third 5154 beast 2226 had 2192 5723 a face 4383 as 5613 a man 444, and 2532 the fourth 5067 beast 2226 [was] like 3664 a flying 4072 5740 eagle 105. 

4:8 And 2532 the four 5064 beasts 2226 had 2192 5707 each 303 1520 of them 2596 1438 six 1803 wings 4420 about 2943 [him]; and 2532 [they were] full 1073 5723 of eyes 3788 within 2081: and 2532 they rest 372 not 3756 2192 5719 day 2250 and 2532 night 3571, saying 3004 5723, Holy 40, holy 40, holy 40, Lord 2962 God 2316 Almighty 3841, which 3588 was 2258 5713 3801, and 2532 is 3801, and 2532 is to come 2064 5740 3801. 

4:9 And 2532 when 3752 those beasts 2226 give 1325 5692 glory 1391 and 2532 honour 5092 and 2532 thanks 2169 to him that sat 2521 5740 on 1909 the throne 2362, who 3588 liveth 2198 5723 for 1519 ever 165 and ever 165, 

4:10 The four 5064 and 2532 twenty 1501 elders 4245 fall down 4098 5699 before 1799 him that sat 2521 5740 on 1909 the throne 2362, and 2532 worship 4352 5719 him that liveth 2198 5723 for 1519 ever 165 and ever 165, and 2532 cast 906 5719 their 848 crowns 4735 before 1799 the throne 2362, saying 3004 5723, 

4:11 Thou art 1488 5748 worthy 514, O Lord 2962, to receive 2983 5629 glory 1391 and 2532 honour 5092 and 2532 power 1411: for 3754 thou 4771 hast created 2936 5656 all things 3956, and 2532 for 1223 thy 4675 pleasure 2307 they are 1526 5748 and 2532 were created 2936 5681. 

5:1 And 2532 I saw 1492 5627 in 1909 the right hand 1188 of him that sat 2521 5740 on 1909 the throne 2362 a book 975 written 1125 5772 within 2081 and 2532 on the backside 3693, sealed 2696 5772 with seven 2033 seals 4973. 

5:2 And 2532 I saw 1492 5627 a strong 2478 angel 32 proclaiming 2784 5723 with a loud 3173 voice 5456, Who 5101 is 2076 5748 worthy 514 to open 455 5658 the book 975, and 2532 to loose 3089 5658 the seals 4973 thereof 846? 

5:3 And 2532 no man 3762 in 1722 heaven 3772, nor 3761 in 1909 earth 1093, neither 3761 under 5270 the earth 1093, was able 1410 5711 to open 455 5658 the book 975, neither 3761 to look 991 5721 thereon 846. 

5:4 And 2532 I 1473 wept 2799 5707 much 4183, because 3754 no man 3762 was found 2147 5681 worthy 514 to open 455 5658 and 2532 to read 314 5629 the book 975, neither 3777 to look 991 5721 thereon 846. 

5:5 And 2532 one 1520 of 1537 the elders 4245 saith 3004 5719 unto me 3427, Weep 2799 5720 not 3361: behold 2400 5628, the Lion 3023 of 5607 5752 1537 the tribe 5443 of Juda 2455, the Root 4491 of David 1138, hath prevailed 3528 5656 to open 455 5658 the book 975, and 2532 to loose 3089 5658 the seven 2033 seals 4973 thereof 846. 

5:6 And 2532 I beheld 1492 5627, and 2532, lo 2400 5628, in 1722 the midst 3319 of the throne 2362 and 2532 of the four 5064 beasts 2226, and 2532 in 1722 the midst 3319 of the elders 4245, stood 2476 5761 a Lamb 721 as 5613 it had been slain 4969 5772, having 2192 5723 seven 2033 horns 2768 and 2532 seven 2033 eyes 3788, which 3739 are 1526 5748 the seven 2033 Spirits 4151 of God 2316 sent forth 649 5772 into 1519 all 3956 the earth 1093. 

5:7 And 2532 he came 2064 5627 and 2532 took 2983 5758 the book 975 out of 1537 the right hand 1188 of him that sat 2521 5740 upon 1909 the throne 2362. 

5:8 And 2532 when 3753 he had taken 2983 5627 the book 975, the four 5064 beasts 2226 and 2532 four 5064 [and] twenty 1501 elders 4245 fell down 4098 5627 before 1799 the Lamb 721, having 2192 5723 every one of them 1538 harps 2788, and 2532 golden 5552 vials 5357 full 1073 5723 of odours 2368, which 3739 are 1526 5748 the prayers 4335 of saints 40. 

5:9 And 2532 they sung 103 5719 a new 2537 song 5603, saying 3004 5723, Thou art 1488 5748 worthy 514 to take 2983 5629 the book 975, and 2532 to open 455 5658 the seals 4973 thereof 846: for 3754 thou wast slain 4969 5648, and 2532 hast redeemed 59 5656 us 2248 to God 2316 by 1722 thy 4675 blood 129 out of 1537 every 3956 kindred 5443, and 2532 tongue 1100, and 2532 people 2992, and 2532 nation 1484; 

5:10 And 2532 hast made 4160 5656 us 2248 unto our 2257 God 2316 kings 935 and 2532 priests 2409: and 2532 we shall reign 936 5692 on 1909 the earth 1093. 

5:11 And 2532 I beheld 1492 5627, and 2532 I heard 191 5656 the voice 5456 of many 4183 angels 32 round about 2943 the throne 2362 and 2532 the beasts 2226 and 2532 the elders 4245: and 2532 the number 706 of them 846 was 2258 5713 ten thousand 3461 times ten thousand 3461, and 2532 thousands 5505 of thousands 5505; 

5:12 Saying 3004 5723 with a loud 3173 voice 5456, Worthy 514 is 2076 5748 the Lamb 721 that was slain 4969 5772 to receive 2983 5629 power 1411, and 2532 riches 4149, and 2532 wisdom 4678, and 2532 strength 2479, and 2532 honour 5092, and 2532 glory 1391, and 2532 blessing 2129. 

5:13 And 2532 every 3956 creature 2938 which 3739 is 2076 5748 in 1722 heaven 3772, and 2532 on 1722 the earth 1093, and 2532 under 5270 the earth 1093, and 2532 such as 3739 are 2076 5748 in 1909 the sea 2281, and 2532 all 3956 that are in 1722 them 846, heard I 191 5656 saying 3004 5723, Blessing 2129, and 2532 honour 5092, and 2532 glory 1391, and 2532 power 2904, [be] unto him that sitteth 2521 5740 upon 1909 the throne 2362, and 2532 unto the Lamb 721 for 1519 ever 165 and ever 165. 

5:14 And 2532 the four 5064 beasts 2226 said 3004 5707, Amen 281. And 2532 the four 5064 [and] twenty 1501 elders 4245 fell down 4098 5627 and 2532 worshipped 4352 5656 him that liveth 2198 5723 for 1519 ever 165 and ever 165. 

6:1 And 2532 I saw 1492 5627 when 3753 the Lamb 721 opened 455 5656 one 3391 of 1537 the seals 4973, and 2532 I heard 191 5656, as it were 5613 the noise 5456 of thunder 1027, one 1520 of 1537 the four 5064 beasts 2226 saying 3004 5723, Come 2064 5736 and 2532 see 991 5720. 

6:2 And 2532 I saw 1492 5627, and 2532 behold 2400 5628 a white 3022 horse 2462: and 2532 he that sat 2521 5740 on 1909 him 846 had 2192 5723 a bow 5115; and 2532 a crown 4735 was given 1325 5681 unto him 846: and 2532 he went forth 1831 5627 conquering 3528 5723, and 2532 to 2443 conquer 3528 5661. 

6:3 And 2532 when 3753 he had opened 455 5656 the second 1208 seal 4973, I heard 191 5656 the second 1208 beast 2226 say 3004 5723, Come 2064 5736 and 2532 see 991 5720. 

6:4 And 2532 there went out 1831 5627 another 243 horse 2462 [that was] red 4450: and 2532 [power] was given 1325 5681 to him 846 that sat 2521 5740 thereon 1909 846 to take 2983 5629 peace 1515 from 575 the earth 1093, and 2532 that 2443 they should kill 4969 5661 one another 240: and 2532 there was given 1325 5681 unto him 846 a great 3173 sword 3162. 

6:5 And 2532 when 3753 he had opened 455 5656 the third 5154 seal 4973, I heard 191 5656 the third 5154 beast 2226 say 3004 5723, Come 2064 5736 and 2532 see 991 5720. And 2532 I beheld 1492 5627, and 2532 lo 2400 5628 a black 3189 horse 2462; and 2532 he that sat 2521 5740 on 1909 him 846 had 2192 5723 a pair of balances 2218 in 1722 his 848 hand 5495. 

6:6 And 2532 I heard 191 5656 a voice 5456 in 1722 the midst 3319 of the four 5064 beasts 2226 say 3004 5723, A measure 5518 of wheat 4621 for a penny 1220, and 2532 three 5140 measures 5518 of barley 2915 for a penny 1220; and 2532 [see] thou hurt 91 5661 not 3361 the oil 1637 and 2532 the wine 3631. 

6:7 And 2532 when 3753 he had opened 455 5656 the fourth 5067 seal 4973, I heard 191 5656 the voice 5456 of the fourth 5067 beast 2226 say 3004 5723, Come 2064 5736 and 2532 see 991 5720. 

6:8 And 2532 I looked 1492 5627, and 2532 behold 2400 5628 a pale 5515 horse 2462: and 2532 his 846 name 3686 that sat 2521 5740 on 1883 him 846 was Death 2288, and 2532 Hell 86 followed 190 5719 with 3326 him 846. And 2532 power 1849 was given 1325 5681 unto them 846 over 1909 the fourth part 5067 of the earth 1093, to kill 615 5658 with 1722 sword 4501, and 2532 with 1722 hunger 3042, and 2532 with 1722 death 2288, and 2532 with 5259 the beasts 2342 of the earth 1093. 

6:9 And 2532 when 3753 he had opened 455 5656 the fifth 3991 seal 4973, I saw 1492 5627 under 5270 the altar 2379 the souls 5590 of them that were slain 4969 5772 for 1223 the word 3056 of God 2316, and 2532 for 1223 the testimony 3141 which 3739 they held 2192 5707: 

6:10 And 2532 they cried 2896 5707 with a loud 3173 voice 5456, saying 3004 5723, How 2193 long 4219, O Lord 1203, holy 40 and 2532 true 228, dost thou 2919 0 not 3756 judge 2919 5719 and 2532 avenge 1556 5719 our 2257 blood 129 on 575 them that dwell 2730 5723 on 1909 the earth 1093? 

6:11 And 2532 white 3022 robes 4749 were given 1325 5681 unto every one of them 1538; and 2532 it was said 4483 5681 unto them 846, that 2443 they should rest 373 5672 yet 2089 for a little 3398 season 5550, until 2193 their 846 fellowservants 4889 also 2532 and 2532 their 846 brethren 80, that should 3195 5723 be killed 615 5745 as 5613 2532 they 846 [were], should 3739 be fulfilled 4137 5695. 

6:12 And 2532 I beheld 1492 5627 when 3753 he had opened 455 5656 the sixth 1623 seal 4973, and 2532, lo 2400 5628, there was 1096 5633 a great 3173 earthquake 4578; and 2532 the sun 2246 became 1096 5633 black 3189 as 5613 sackcloth 4526 of hair 5155, and 2532 the moon 4582 became 1096 5633 as 5613 blood 129; 

6:13 And 2532 the stars 792 of heaven 3772 fell 4098 5627 unto 1519 the earth 1093, even as 5613 a fig tree 4808 casteth 906 5719 her 848 untimely figs 3653, when she is shaken 4579 5746 of 5259 a mighty 3173 wind 417. 

6:14 And 2532 the heaven 3772 departed 673 5681 as 5613 a scroll 975 when it is rolled together 1507 5746; and 2532 every 3956 mountain 3735 and 2532 island 3520 were moved 2795 5681 out of 1537 their 848 places 5117. 

6:15 And 2532 the kings 935 of the earth 1093, and 2532 the great men 3175, and 2532 the rich men 4145, and 2532 the chief captains 5506, and 2532 the mighty men 1415, and 2532 every 3956 bondman 1401, and 2532 every 3956 free man 1658, hid 2928 5656 themselves 1438 in 1519 the dens 4693 and 2532 in 1519 the rocks 4073 of the mountains 3735; 

6:16 And 2532 said 3004 5719 to the mountains 3735 and 2532 rocks 4073, Fall 4098 5628 on 1909 us 2248, and 2532 hide 2928 5657 us 2248 from 575 the face 4383 of him that sitteth 2521 5740 on 1909 the throne 2362, and 2532 from 575 the wrath 3709 of the Lamb 721: 

6:17 For 3754 the great 3173 day 2250 of his 846 wrath 3709 is come 2064 5627; and 2532 who 5101 shall be able 1410 5736 to stand 2476 5683? 

7:1 And 2532 after 3326 these things 5023 I saw 1492 5627 four 5064 angels 32 standing 2476 5761 on 1909 the four 5064 corners 1137 of the earth 1093, holding 2902 5723 the four 5064 winds 417 of the earth 1093, that 3363 0 the wind 417 should 4154 0 not 3363 blow 4154 5725 on 1909 the earth 1093, nor 3383 on 1909 the sea 2281, nor 3383 on 1909 any 3956 tree 1186. 

7:2 And 2532 I saw 1492 5627 another 243 angel 32 ascending 305 5631 5625 305 5723 from 575 the east 395 2246, having 2192 5723 the seal 4973 of the living 2198 5723 God 2316: and 2532 he cried 2896 5656 with a loud 3173 voice 5456 to the four 5064 angels 32, to whom 3739 it 846 was given 1325 5681 to hurt 91 5658 the earth 1093 and 2532 the sea 2281, 

7:3 Saying 3004 5723, Hurt 91 5661 not 3361 the earth 1093, neither 3383 the sea 2281, nor 3383 the trees 1186, till 891 3739 we have sealed 4972 5725 5625 4972 5661 the servants 1401 of our 2257 God 2316 in 1909 their 846 foreheads 3359. 

7:4 And 2532 I heard 191 5656 the number 706 of them which were sealed 4972 5772: [and there were] sealed 4972 5772 an hundred 1540 [and] forty 5062 [and] four 5064 thousand 5505 of 1537 all 3956 the tribes 5443 of the children 5207 of Israel 2474. 

7:5 Of 1537 the tribe 5443 of Juda 2455 [were] sealed 4972 5772 twelve 1427 thousand 5505. Of 1537 the tribe 5443 of Reuben 4502 [were] sealed 4972 5772 twelve 1427 thousand 5505. Of 1537 the tribe 5443 of Gad 1045 [were] sealed 4972 5772 twelve 1427 thousand 5505. 

7:6 Of 1537 the tribe 5443 of Aser 768 [were] sealed 4972 5772 twelve 1427 thousand 5505. Of 1537 the tribe 5443 of Nepthalim 3508 [were] sealed 4972 5772 twelve 1427 thousand 5505. Of 1537 the tribe 5443 of Manasses 3128 [were] sealed 4972 5772 twelve 1427 thousand 5505. 

7:7 Of 1537 the tribe 5443 of Simeon 4826 [were] sealed 4972 5772 twelve 1427 thousand 5505. Of 1537 the tribe 5443 of Levi 3017 [were] sealed 4972 5772 twelve 1427 thousand 5505. Of 1537 the tribe 5443 of Issachar 2466 [were] sealed 4972 5772 twelve 1427 thousand 5505. 

7:8 Of 1537 the tribe 5443 of Zabulon 2194 [were] sealed 4972 5772 twelve 1427 thousand 5505. Of 1537 the tribe 5443 of Joseph 2501 [were] sealed 4972 5772 twelve 1427 thousand 5505. Of 1537 the tribe 5443 of Benjamin 958 [were] sealed 4972 5772 twelve 1427 thousand 5505. 

7:9 After 3326 this 5023 I beheld 1492 5627, and 2532, lo 2400 5628, a great 4183 multitude 3793, which 3739 no man 3762 could 1410 5711 number 705 5658 846, of 1537 all 3956 nations 1484, and 2532 kindreds 5443, and 2532 people 2992, and 2532 tongues 1100, stood 2476 5761 before 1799 the throne 2362, and 2532 before 1799 the Lamb 721, clothed 4016 5772 with white 3022 robes 4749, and 2532 palms 5404 in 1722 their 846 hands 5495; 

7:10 And 2532 cried 2896 5723 with a loud 3173 voice 5456, saying 3004 5723, Salvation 4991 to our 2257 God 2316 which 3588 sitteth 2521 5740 upon 1909 the throne 2362, and 2532 unto the Lamb 721. 

7:11 And 2532 all 3956 the angels 32 stood 2476 5715 round about 2945 the throne 2362, and 2532 [about] the elders 4245 and 2532 the four 5064 beasts 2226, and 2532 fell 4098 5627 before 1799 the throne 2362 on 1909 their 848 faces 4383, and 2532 worshipped 4352 5656 God 2316, 

7:12 Saying 3004 5723, Amen 281: Blessing 2129, and 2532 glory 1391, and 2532 wisdom 4678, and 2532 thanksgiving 2169, and 2532 honour 5092, and 2532 power 1411, and 2532 might 2479, [be] unto our 2257 God 2316 for 1519 ever 165 and ever 165. Amen 281. 

7:13 And 2532 one 1520 of 1537 the elders 4245 answered 611 5662, saying 3004 5723 unto me 3427, What 5101 are 1526 5748 these 3778 which 3588 are arrayed in 4016 5772 white 3022 robes 4749? and 2532 whence 4159 came they 2064 5627? 

7:14 And 2532 I said 2046 5758 unto him 848, Sir 2962, thou 4771 knowest 1492 5758. And 2532 he said 2036 5627 to me 3427, These 3778 are they 1526 5748 which came 2064 5740 out of 1537 great 3173 tribulation 2347, and 2532 have washed 4150 5656 their 848 robes 4749, and 2532 made 3021 0 them 4749 846 white 3021 5656 in 1722 the blood 129 of the Lamb 721. 

7:15 Therefore 1223 5124 are they 1526 5748 before 1799 the throne 2362 of God 2316, and 2532 serve 3000 5719 him 846 day 2250 and 2532 night 3571 in 1722 his 846 temple 3485: and 2532 he that sitteth 2521 5740 on 1909 the throne 2362 shall dwell 4637 5692 among 1909 them 846. 

7:16 They shall hunger 3983 5692 no 3756 more 2089, neither 3761 thirst 1372 5692 any more 2089; neither 3761 3361 shall 4098 0 the sun 2246 light 4098 5632 on 1909 them 846, nor 3761 any 3956 heat 2738. 

7:17 For 3754 the Lamb 721 which 3588 is in 303 the midst 3319 of the throne 2362 shall feed 4165 5692 them 846, and 2532 shall lead 3594 5692 them 846 unto 1909 living 2198 5723 fountains 4077 of waters 5204: and 2532 God 2316 shall wipe away 1813 5692 all 3956 tears 1144 from 575 their 846 eyes 3788. 

8:1 And 2532 when 3753 he had opened 455 5656 the seventh 1442 seal 4973, there was 1096 5633 silence 4602 in 1722 heaven 3772 about the space of 5613 half an hour 2256. 

8:2 And 2532 I saw 1492 5627 the seven 2033 angels 32 which 3739 stood 2476 5758 before 1799 God 2316; and 2532 to them 846 were given 1325 5681 seven 2033 trumpets 4536. 

8:3 And 2532 another 243 angel 32 came 2064 5627 and 2532 stood 2476 5681 at 1909 the altar 2379, having 2192 5723 a golden 5552 censer 3031; and 2532 there was given 1325 5681 unto him 846 much 4183 incense 2368, that 2443 he should offer 1325 5661 [it] with the prayers 4335 of all 3956 saints 40 upon 1909 the golden 5552 altar 2379 which 3588 was before 1799 the throne 2362. 

8:4 And 2532 the smoke 2586 of the incense 2368, [which came] with the prayers 4335 of the saints 40, ascended up 305 5627 before 1799 God 2316 out of 1537 the angel's 32 hand 5495. 

8:5 And 2532 the angel 32 took 2983 5758 the censer 3031, and 2532 filled 1072 5656 it 846 with 1537 fire 4442 of the altar 2379, and 2532 cast 906 5627 [it] into 1519 the earth 1093: and 2532 there were 1096 5633 voices 5456, and 2532 thunderings 1027, and 2532 lightnings 796, and 2532 an earthquake 4578. 

8:6 And 2532 the seven 2033 angels 32 which 3588 had 2192 5723 the seven 2033 trumpets 4536 prepared 2090 5656 themselves 1438 to 2443 sound 4537 5661. 

8:7 2532 The first 4413 angel 32 sounded 4537 5656, and 2532 there followed 1096 5633 hail 5464 and 2532 fire 4442 mingled 3396 5772 with blood 129, and 2532 they were cast 906 5681 upon 1519 the earth 1093: and 2532 the third part 5154 of trees 1186 was burnt up 2618 5648, and 2532 all 3956 green 5515 grass 5528 was burnt up 2618 5648. 

8:8 And 2532 the second 1208 angel 32 sounded 4537 5656, and 2532 as it were 5613 a great 3173 mountain 3735 burning 2545 5746 with fire 4442 was cast 906 5681 into 1519 the sea 2281: and 2532 the third part 5154 of the sea 2281 became 1096 5633 blood 129; 

8:9 And 2532 the third part 5154 of the creatures 2938 which 3588 were in 1722 the sea 2281, and had 2192 5723 life 5590, died 599 5627; and 2532 the third part 5154 of the ships 4143 were destroyed 1311 5648. 

8:10 And 2532 the third 5154 angel 32 sounded 4537 5656, and 2532 there fell 4098 5627 a great 3173 star 792 from 1537 heaven 3772, burning 2545 5746 as it were 5613 a lamp 2985, and 2532 it fell 4098 5627 upon 1909 the third part 5154 of the rivers 4215, and 2532 upon 1909 the fountains 4077 of waters 5204; 

8:11 And 2532 the name 3686 of the star 792 is called 3004 5743 Wormwood 894: and 2532 the third part 5154 of the waters 5204 became 1096 5736 1519 wormwood 894; and 2532 many 4183 men 444 died 599 5627 of 1537 the waters 5204, because 3754 they were made bitter 4087 5681. 

8:12 And 2532 the fourth 5067 angel 32 sounded 4537 5656, and 2532 the third part 5154 of the sun 2246 was smitten 4141 5648, and 2532 the third part 5154 of the moon 4582, and 2532 the third part 5154 of the stars 792; so as 2443 the third part 5154 of them 846 was darkened 4654 5686, and 2532 the day 2250 shone 5316 5725 not 3361 for a third part 5154 of it 848, and 2532 the night 3571 likewise 3668. 

8:13 And 2532 I beheld 1492 5627, and 2532 heard 191 5656 an 1520 angel 32 flying 4072 5740 through 1722 the midst of heaven 3321, saying 3004 5723 with a loud 3173 voice 5456, Woe 3759, woe 3759, woe 3759, to the inhabiters 2730 5723 of 1909 the earth 1093 by reason of 1537 the other 3062 voices 5456 of the trumpet 4536 of the three 5140 angels 32, which 3588 are yet 3195 5723 to sound 4537 5721! 

9:1 And 2532 the fifth 3991 angel 32 sounded 4537 5656, and 2532 I saw 1492 5627 a star 792 fall 4098 5761 from 1537 heaven 3772 unto 1519 the earth 1093: and 2532 to him 846 was given 1325 5681 the key 2807 of the bottomless 12 pit 5421. 

9:2 And 2532 he opened 455 5656 the bottomless 12 pit 5421; and 2532 there arose 305 5627 a smoke 2586 out of 1537 the pit 5421, as 5613 the smoke 2586 of a great 3173 furnace 2575; and 2532 the sun 2246 and 2532 the air 109 were darkened 4654 5681 by reason of 1537 the smoke 2586 of the pit 5421. 

9:3 And 2532 there came 1831 5627 out of 1537 the smoke 2586 locusts 200 upon 1519 the earth 1093: and 2532 unto them 846 was given 1325 5681 power 1849, as 5613 the scorpions 4651 of the earth 1093 have 2192 5719 power 1849. 

9:4 And 2532 it was commanded 4483 5681 them 846 that 3363 0 they should 91 0 not 3363 hurt 91 5661 the grass 5528 of the earth 1093, neither 3761 any 3956 green thing 5515, neither 3761 any 3956 tree 1186; but 1508 only 3441 those men 444 which 3748 have 2192 5719 not 3756 the seal 4973 of God 2316 in 1909 their 848 foreheads 3359. 

9:5 And 2532 to them 846 it was given 1325 5681 that 3363 0 they should 615 0 not 3363 kill 615 5725 them 846, but 235 that 2443 they should be tormented 928 5686 five 4002 months 3376: and 2532 their 846 torment 929 [was] as 5613 the torment 929 of a scorpion 4651, when 3752 he striketh 3817 5661 a man 444. 

9:6 And 2532 in 1722 those 1565 days 2250 shall men 444 seek 2212 5692 death 2288, and 2532 shall 2147 0 not 3756 find 2147 5692 it 846; and 2532 shall desire 1937 5692 to die 599 5629, and 2532 death 2288 shall flee 5343 5695 from 575 them 846. 

9:7 And 2532 the shapes 3667 of the locusts 200 [were] like 3664 unto horses 2462 prepared 2090 5772 unto 1519 battle 4171; and 2532 on 1909 their 846 heads 2776 [were] as it were 5613 crowns 4735 like 3664 gold 5557, and 2532 their 846 faces 4383 [were] as 5613 the faces 4383 of men 444. 

9:8 And 2532 they had 2192 5707 hair 2359 as 5613 the hair 2359 of women 1135, and 2532 their 846 teeth 3599 were 2258 5713 as 5613 [the teeth] of lions 3023. 

9:9 And 2532 they had 2192 5707 breastplates 2382, as it were 5613 breastplates 2382 of iron 4603; and 2532 the sound 5456 of their 846 wings 4420 [was] as 5613 the sound 5456 of chariots 716 of many 4183 horses 2462 running 5143 5723 to 1519 battle 4171. 

9:10 And 2532 they had 2192 5719 tails 3769 like 3664 unto scorpions 4651, and 2532 there were 2258 5713 stings 2759 in 1722 their 846 tails 3769: and 2532 their 846 power 1849 [was] to hurt 91 5658 men 444 five 4002 months 3376. 

9:11 And 2532 they had 2192 5719 a king 935 over 1909 them 848, [which is] the angel 32 of the bottomless pit 12, whose 846 name 3686 in the Hebrew tongue 1447 [is] Abaddon 3, but 2532 in 1722 the Greek tongue 1673 hath 2192 5719 [his] name 3686 Apollyon 623. 

9:12 One 3391 woe 3759 is past 565 5627; [and], behold 2400 5628, there come 2064 5736 two 1417 woes 3759 more 2089 hereafter 3326 5023. 

9:13 And 2532 the sixth 1623 angel 32 sounded 4537 5656, and 2532 I heard 191 5656 a 3391 voice 5456 from 1537 the four 5064 horns 2768 of the golden 5552 altar 2379 which 3588 is before 1799 God 2316, 

9:14 Saying 3004 5723 to the sixth 1623 angel 32 which 3739 had 2192 5707 the trumpet 4536, Loose 3089 5657 the four 5064 angels 32 which 3588 are bound 1210 5772 in 1909 the great 3173 river 4215 Euphrates 2166. 

9:15 And 2532 the four 5064 angels 32 were loosed 3089 5681, which 3588 were prepared 2090 5772 for 1519 an hour 5610, and 2532 a day 2250, and 2532 a month 3376, and 2532 a year 1763, for to 2443 slay 615 5725 the third part 5154 of men 444. 

9:16 And 2532 the number 706 of the army 4753 of the horsemen 2461 [were] two hundred 1417 thousand 3461 thousand 3461: and 2532 I heard 191 5656 the number 706 of them 846. 

9:17 And 2532 thus 3779 I saw 1492 5627 the horses 2462 in 1722 the vision 3706, and 2532 them that sat 2521 5740 on 1909 them 846, having 2192 5723 breastplates 2382 of fire 4447, and 2532 of jacinth 5191, and 2532 brimstone 2306: and 2532 the heads 2776 of the horses 2462 [were] as 5613 the heads 2776 of lions 3023; and 2532 out of 1537 their 846 mouths 4750 issued 1607 5736 fire 4442 and 2532 smoke 2586 and 2532 brimstone 2303. 

9:18 By 5259 these 5130 three 5140 was 615 0 the third part 5154 of men 444 killed 615 5681, by 1537 the fire 4442, and 2532 by 1537 the smoke 2586, and 2532 by 1537 the brimstone 2303, which 3588 issued 1607 5740 out of 1537 their 846 mouths 4750. 

9:19 For 1063 their 846 power 1849 is 1526 5748 5625 2076 5748 in 1722 their 846 mouth 4750, and 2532 in 1722 their 846 tails 3769: for 1063 their 846 tails 3769 [were] like 3664 unto serpents 3789, and had 2192 5723 heads 2776, and 2532 with 1722 them 846 they do hurt 91 5719. 

9:20 And 2532 the rest 3062 of the men 444 which 3739 were 615 0 not 3756 killed 615 5681 by 1722 these 5025 plagues 4127 yet 3777 0 repented 3340 5656 not 3777 of 1537 the works 2041 of their 848 hands 5495, that 3363 0 they should 4352 0 not 3363 worship 4352 5661 devils 1140, and 2532 idols 1497 of gold 5552, and 2532 silver 693, and 2532 brass 5470, and 2532 stone 3035, and 2532 of wood 3585: which 3739 neither 3777 can 1410 5736 see 991 5721, nor 3777 hear 191 5721, nor 3777 walk 4043 5721: 

9:21 Neither 2532 3756 repented they 3340 5656 of 1537 their 848 murders 5408, nor 3777 of 1537 their 848 sorceries 5331, nor 3777 of 1537 their 848 fornication 4202, nor 3777 of 1537 their 848 thefts 2809. 

10:1 And 2532 I saw 1492 5627 another 243 mighty 2478 angel 32 come down 2597 5723 from 1537 heaven 3772, clothed 4016 5772 with a cloud 3507: and 2532 a rainbow 2463 [was] upon 1909 his 846 head 2776, and 2532 his 846 face 4383 [was] as it were 5613 the sun 2246, and 2532 his 846 feet 4228 as 5613 pillars 4769 of fire 4442: 

10:2 And 2532 he had 2192 5707 in 1722 his 848 hand 5495 a little book 974 open 455 5772: and 2532 he set 5087 5656 his 848 right 1188 foot 4228 upon 1909 the sea 2281, and 1161 [his] left 2176 [foot] on 1909 the earth 1093, 

10:3 And 2532 cried 2896 5656 with a loud 3173 voice 5456, as 5618 [when] a lion 3023 roareth 3455 5736: and 2532 when 3753 he had cried 2896 5656, seven 2033 thunders 1027 uttered 2980 5656 their 1438 voices 5456. 

10:4 And 2532 when 3753 the seven 2033 thunders 1027 had uttered 2980 5656 their 1438 voices 5456, I was about 3195 5707 to write 1125 5721: and 2532 I heard 191 5656 a voice 5456 from 1537 heaven 3772 saying 3004 5723 unto me 3427, Seal up 4972 5657 those things which 3739 the seven 2033 thunders 1027 uttered 2980 5656, and 2532 write 1125 5661 them 5023 not 3361. 

10:5 And 2532 the angel 32 which 3739 I saw 1492 5627 stand 2476 5761 upon 1909 the sea 2281 and 2532 upon 1909 the earth 1093 lifted up 142 5656 his 848 hand 5495 to 1519 heaven 3772, 

10:6 And 2532 sware 3660 5656 by 1722 him that liveth 2198 5723 for 1519 ever 165 and ever 165, who created 2936 5656 heaven 3772, and 2532 the things that therein are 1722 846, and 2532 the earth 1093, and 2532 the things that therein are 1722 846, and 2532 the sea 2281, and 2532 the things which are therein 1722 846, that 3754 there should be 2071 5704 time 5550 no 3756 longer 2089: 

10:7 But 235 in 1722 the days 2250 of the voice 5456 of the seventh 1442 angel 32, when 3752 he shall begin 3195 5725 to sound 4537 5721, 2532 the mystery 3466 of God 2316 should be finished 5055 5686, as 5613 he hath declared 2097 5656 to his 1438 servants 1401 the prophets 4396. 

10:8 And 2532 the voice 5456 which 3739 I heard 191 5656 from 1537 heaven 3772 spake 2980 5723 unto 3326 me 1700 again 3825, and 2532 said 3004 5723, Go 5217 5720 [and] take 2983 5628 the little book 974 which 3588 is open 455 5772 in 1722 the hand 5495 of the angel 32 which 3588 standeth 2476 5761 upon 1909 the sea 2281 and 2532 upon 1909 the earth 1093. 

10:9 And 2532 I went 565 5627 unto 4314 the angel 32, and said 3004 5723 unto him 846, Give 1325 5628 me 3427 the little book 974. And 2532 he said 3004 5719 unto me 3427, Take 2983 5628 [it], and 2532 eat 2719 0 it 846 up 2719 5628; and it 2532 shall make 4087 0 thy 4675 belly 2836 bitter 4087 5692, but 235 it shall be 2071 5704 in 1722 thy 4675 mouth 4750 sweet 1099 as 5613 honey 3192. 

10:10 And 2532 I took 2983 5627 the little book 974 out of 1537 the angel's 32 hand 5495, and 2532 ate 2719 0 it 846 up 2719 5627; and 2532 it was 2258 5713 in 1722 my 3450 mouth 4750 sweet 1099 as 5613 honey 3192: and 2532 as soon as 3753 I had eaten 5315 5627 it 846, my 3450 belly 2836 was bitter 4087 5681. 

10:11 And 2532 he said 3004 5719 unto me 3427, Thou 4571 must 1163 5748 prophesy 4395 5658 again 3825 before 1909 many 4183 peoples 2992, and 2532 nations 1484, and 2532 tongues 1100, and 2532 kings 935. 

11:1 And 2532 there was given 1325 5681 me 3427 a reed 2563 like 3664 unto a rod 4464: and 2532 the angel 32 stood 2476 5715, saying 3004 5723, Rise 1453 5669, and 2532 measure 3354 5657 the temple 3485 of God 2316, and 2532 the altar 2379, and 2532 them that worship 4352 5723 therein 1722 846. 

11:2 But 2532 the court 833 which 3588 is without 1855 2081 the temple 3485 leave 1544 5628 out 1854, and 2532 measure 3354 5661 it 846 not 3361; for 3754 it is given 1325 5681 unto the Gentiles 1484: and 2532 the holy 40 city 4172 shall they tread under foot 3961 5692 forty 5062 [and] two 1417 months 3376. 

11:3 And 2532 I will give 1325 5692 [power] unto my 3450 two 1417 witnesses 3144, and 2532 they shall prophesy 4395 5692 a thousand 5507 two hundred 1250 [and] threescore 1835 days 2250, clothed in 4016 5772 sackcloth 4526. 

11:4 These 3778 are 1526 5748 the two 1417 olive 1636 trees, and 2532 the two 1417 candlesticks 3087 standing 2476 5761 before 1799 the God 2316 of the earth 1093. 

11:5 And 2532 if any man 1536 will 2309 5725 hurt 91 5658 them 846, fire 4442 proceedeth 1607 5736 out of 1537 their 846 mouth 4750, and 2532 devoureth 2719 5719 their 846 enemies 2190: and 2532 if any man 1536 will 2309 5725 hurt 91 5658 them 846, he must 1163 5748 in this manner 3779 be killed 615 5683. 

11:6 These 3778 have 2192 5719 power 1849 to shut 2808 5658 heaven 3772, that 3363 0 it rain 1026 5725 5205 not 3363 in 1722 the days 2250 of their 846 prophecy 4394: and 2532 have 2192 5719 power 1849 over 1909 waters 5204 to turn 4762 5721 them 846 to 1519 blood 129, and 2532 to smite 3960 5658 the earth 1093 with all 3956 plagues 4127, as often 3740 as 1437 they will 2309 5661. 

11:7 And 2532 when 3752 they shall have finished 5055 5661 their 848 testimony 3141, the beast 2342 that ascendeth 305 5723 out of 1537 the bottomless pit 12 shall make 4160 5692 war 4171 against 3326 them 846, and 2532 shall overcome 3528 5692 them 846, and 2532 kill 615 5692 them 846. 

11:8 And 2532 their 846 dead bodies 4430 [shall lie] in 1909 the street 4113 of the great 3173 city 4172, which 3748 spiritually 4153 is called 2564 5743 Sodom 4670 and 2532 Egypt 125, where 3699 also 2532 our 2257 Lord 2962 was crucified 4717 5681. 

11:9 And 2532 they 991 0 of 1537 the people 2992 and 2532 kindreds 5443 and 2532 tongues 1100 and 2532 nations 1484 shall see 991 5692 their 846 dead bodies 4430 three 5140 days 2250 and 2532 an half 2255, and 2532 shall 863 0 not 3756 suffer 863 5692 their 846 dead bodies 4430 to be put 5087 5683 in 1519 graves 3418. 

11:10 And 2532 they that dwell 2730 5723 upon 1909 the earth 1093 shall rejoice 5463 5692 over 1909 them 846, and 2532 make merry 2165 5701, and 2532 shall send 3992 5692 gifts 1435 one to another 240; because 3754 these 3778 two 1417 prophets 4396 tormented 928 5656 them that dwelt 2730 5723 on 1909 the earth 1093. 

11:11 And 2532 after 3326 three 5140 days 2250 and 2532 an half 2255 the Spirit 4151 of life 2222 from 1537 God 2316 entered 1525 5627 into 1909 them 846, and 2532 they stood 2476 5627 upon 1909 their 848 feet 4228; and 2532 great 3173 fear 5401 fell 4098 5627 upon 1909 them which saw 2334 5723 them 846. 

11:12 And 2532 they heard 191 5656 a great 3173 voice 5456 from 1537 heaven 3772 saying 3004 5723 unto them 846, Come up 305 5628 hither 5602. And 2532 they ascended up 305 5627 to 1519 heaven 3772 in 1722 a cloud 3507; and 2532 their 846 enemies 2190 beheld 2334 5656 them 846. 

11:13 And 2532 the same 1722 1565 hour 5610 was there 1096 5633 a great 3173 earthquake 4578, and 2532 the tenth part 1182 of the city 4172 fell 4098 5627, and 2532 in 1722 the earthquake 4578 were slain 615 5681 3686 of men 444 seven 2033 thousand 5505: and 2532 the remnant 3062 were 1096 5633 affrighted 1719, and 2532 gave 1325 5656 glory 1391 to the God 2316 of heaven 3772. 

11:14 The second 1208 woe 3759 is past 565 5627; [and], behold 2400 5628, the third 5154 woe 3759 cometh 2064 5736 quickly 5035. 

11:15 And 2532 the seventh 1442 angel 32 sounded 4537 5656; and 2532 there were 1096 5633 great 3173 voices 5456 in 1722 heaven 3772, saying 3004 5723, The kingdoms 932 of this world 2889 are become 1096 5633 [the kingdoms] of our 2257 Lord 2962, and 2532 of his 846 Christ 5547; and 2532 he shall reign 936 5692 for 1519 ever 165 and ever 165. 

11:16 And 2532 the four 5064 and 2532 twenty 1501 elders 4245, which 3588 sat 2521 5740 before 1799 God 2316 on 1909 their 848 seats 2362, fell 4098 5627 upon 1909 their 848 faces 4383, and 2532 worshipped 4352 5656 God 2316, 

11:17 Saying 3004 5723, We give 2168 0 thee 4671 thanks 2168 5719, O Lord 2962 God 2316 Almighty 3841, which 3588 art 3801, and 2532 wast 2258 5713 5625 3801, and 2532 art to come 2064 5740 5625 3801; because 3754 thou hast taken to thee 2983 5758 thy 4675 great 3173 power 1411, and 2532 hast reigned 936 5656. 

11:18 And 2532 the nations 1484 were angry 3710 5681, and 2532 thy 4675 wrath 3709 is come 2064 5627, and 2532 the time 2540 of the dead 3498, that they should be judged 2919 5683, and 2532 that thou shouldest give 1325 5629 reward 3408 unto thy 4675 servants 1401 the prophets 4396, and 2532 to the saints 40, and 2532 them that fear 5399 5740 thy 4675 name 3686, small 3398 and 2532 great 3173; and 2532 shouldest destroy 1311 5658 them which destroy 1311 5723 the earth 1093. 

11:19 And 2532 the temple 3485 of God 2316 was opened 455 5648 in 1722 heaven 3772, and 2532 there was seen 3700 5681 in 1722 his 846 temple 3485 the ark 2787 of his 846 testament 1242: and 2532 there were 1096 5633 lightnings 796, and 2532 voices 5456, and 2532 thunderings 1027, and 2532 an earthquake 4578, and 2532 great 3173 hail 5464. 

12:1 And 2532 there appeared 3700 5681 a great 3173 wonder 4592 in 1722 heaven 3772; a woman 1135 clothed 4016 5772 with the sun 2246, and 2532 the moon 4582 under 5270 her 846 feet 4228, and 2532 upon 1909 her 846 head 2776 a crown 4735 of twelve 1427 stars 792: 

12:2 And 2532 she being 2192 5723 with 1722 child 1064 cried 2896 5719, travailing in birth 5605 5723, and 2532 pained 928 5746 to be delivered 5088 5629. 

12:3 And 2532 there appeared 3700 5681 another 243 wonder 4592 in 1722 heaven 3772; and 2532 behold 2400 5628 a great 3173 red 4450 dragon 1404, having 2192 5723 seven 2033 heads 2776 and 2532 ten 1176 horns 2768, and 2532 seven 2033 crowns 1238 upon 1909 his 848 heads 2776. 

12:4 And 2532 his 846 tail 3769 drew 4951 5719 the third part 5154 of the stars 792 of heaven 3772, and 2532 did cast 906 5627 them 846 to 1519 the earth 1093: and 2532 the dragon 1404 stood 2476 5707 5758 before 1799 the woman 1135 which 3588 was ready 3195 5723 to be delivered 5088 5629, for 2443 to devour 2719 5632 her 846 child 5043 as soon as 3752 it was born 5088 5632. 

12:5 And 2532 she brought forth 5088 5627 a man 730 child 5207, who 3739 was 3195 5719 to rule 4165 5721 all 3956 nations 1484 with 1722 a rod 4464 of iron 4603: and 2532 her 846 child 5043 was caught up 726 5681 unto 4314 God 2316, and 2532 [to] his 846 throne 2362. 

12:6 And 2532 the woman 1135 fled 5343 5627 into 1519 the wilderness 2048, where 3699 she hath 2192 5719 a place 5117 prepared 2090 5772 of 575 God 2316, that 2443 they should feed 5142 5725 her 846 there 1563 a thousand 5507 two hundred 1250 [and] threescore 1835 days 2250. 

12:7 And 2532 there was 1096 5633 war 4171 in 1722 heaven 3772: Michael 3413 and 2532 his 846 angels 32 fought 4170 5656 against 2596 the dragon 1404; and 2532 the dragon 1404 fought 4170 5656 and 2532 his 846 angels 32, 

12:8 And 2532 prevailed 2480 5656 not 3756; neither 3777 was their place 5117 found 2147 5681 any more 2089 in 1722 heaven 3772. 

12:9 And 2532 the great 3173 dragon 1404 was cast out 906 5681, that old 744 serpent 3789, called 2564 5746 the Devil 1228, and 2532 Satan 4567, which 3588 deceiveth 4105 5723 the whole 3650 world 3625: he was cast out 906 5681 into 1519 the earth 1093, and 2532 his 846 angels 32 were cast out 906 5681 with 3326 him 846. 

12:10 And 2532 I heard 191 5656 a loud 3173 voice 5456 saying 3004 5723 in 1722 heaven 3772, Now 737 is come 1096 5633 salvation 4991, and 2532 strength 1411, and 2532 the kingdom 932 of our 2257 God 2316, and 2532 the power 1849 of his 846 Christ 5547: for 3754 the accuser 2723 5723 of our 2257 brethren 80 is cast down 2598 5681, which 3588 accused 2725 them 846 before 1799 our 2257 God 2316 day 2250 and 2532 night 3571. 

12:11 And 2532 they overcame 3528 5656 him 846 by 1223 the blood 129 of the Lamb 721, and 2532 by 1223 the word 3056 of their 848 testimony 3141; and 2532 they loved 25 5656 not 3756 their 848 lives 5590 unto 891 the death 2288. 

12:12 Therefore 1223 5124 rejoice 2165 5744, [ye] heavens 3772, and 2532 ye that dwell 4637 5723 in 1722 them 846. Woe 3759 to the inhabiters 2730 5723 of the earth 1093 and 2532 of the sea 2281! for 3754 the devil 1228 is come down 2597 5627 unto 4314 you 5209, having 2192 5723 great 3173 wrath 2372, because he knoweth 1492 5761 that 3754 he hath 2192 5719 but a short 3641 time 2540. 

12:13 And 2532 when 3753 the dragon 1404 saw 1492 5627 that 3754 he was cast 906 5681 unto 1519 the earth 1093, he persecuted 1377 5656 the woman 1135 which 3748 brought forth 5088 5627 the man 730 [child]. 

12:14 And 2532 to the woman 1135 were given 1325 5681 two 1417 wings 4420 of a great 3173 eagle 105, that 2443 she might fly 4072 5741 into 1519 the wilderness 2048, into 1519 her 848 place 5117, where 3699 she is nourished 5142 5743 for a time 1563 2540, and 2532 times 2540, and 2532 half 2255 a time 2540, from 575 the face 4383 of the serpent 3789. 

12:15 And 2532 the serpent 3789 cast 906 5627 out of 1537 his 848 mouth 4750 water 5204 as 5613 a flood 4215 after 3694 the woman 1135, that 2443 he might cause 4160 5661 her 5026 to be carried away of the flood 4216. 

12:16 And 2532 the earth 1093 helped 997 5656 the woman 1135, and 2532 the earth 1093 opened 455 5656 her 848 mouth 4750, and 2532 swallowed up 2666 5627 the flood 4215 which 3739 the dragon 1404 cast 906 5627 out of 1537 his 848 mouth 4750. 

12:17 And 2532 the dragon 1404 was wroth 3710 5681 with 1909 the woman 1135, and 2532 went 565 5627 to make 4160 5658 war 4171 with 3326 the remnant 3062 of her 846 seed 4690, which 3588 keep 5083 5723 the commandments 1785 of God 2316, and 2532 have 2192 5723 the testimony 3141 of Jesus 2424 Christ 5547. 

13:1 And 2532 I stood 2476 5681 upon 1909 the sand 285 of the sea 2281, and 2532 saw 1492 5627 a beast 2342 rise up 305 5723 out of 1537 the sea 2281, having 2192 5723 seven 2033 heads 2776 and 2532 ten 1176 horns 2768, and 2532 upon 1909 his 846 horns 2768 ten 1176 crowns 1238, and 2532 upon 1909 his 846 heads 2776 the name 3686 of blasphemy 988. 

13:2 And 2532 the beast 2342 which 3739 I saw 1492 5627 was 2258 5713 like 3664 unto a leopard 3917, and 2532 his 846 feet 4228 were as 5613 [the feet] of a bear 715, and 2532 his 846 mouth 4750 as 5613 the mouth 4750 of a lion 3023: and 2532 the dragon 1404 gave 1325 5656 him 846 his 848 power 1411, and 2532 his 848 seat 2362, and 2532 great 3173 authority 1849. 

13:3 And 2532 I saw 1492 5627 one 3391 of his 846 heads 2776 as it were 5613 wounded 4969 5772 to 1519 death 2288; and 2532 his 846 deadly 2288 wound 4127 was healed 2323 5681: and 2532 all 3650 the world 1093 wondered 2296 5681 5625 2296 5656 after 3694 1722 the beast 2342. 

13:4 And 2532 they worshipped 4352 5656 the dragon 1404 which 3739 gave 1325 5656 power 1849 unto the beast 2342: and 2532 they worshipped 4352 5656 the beast 2342, saying 3004 5723, Who 5101 [is] like 3664 unto the beast 2342? who 5101 is able 1410 5736 to make war 4170 5658 with 3326 him 846? 

13:5 And 2532 there was given 1325 5681 unto him 846 a mouth 4750 speaking 2980 5723 great things 3173 and 2532 blasphemies 988; and 2532 power 1849 was given 1325 5681 unto him 846 to continue 4160 5658 forty 5062 [and] two 1417 months 3376. 

13:6 And 2532 he opened 455 5656 his 848 mouth 4750 in 1519 blasphemy 988 against 4314 God 2316, to blaspheme 987 5658 his 846 name 3686, and 2532 his 846 tabernacle 4633, and 2532 them that dwell 4637 5723 in 1722 heaven 3772. 

13:7 And 2532 it was given 1325 5681 unto him 846 to make 4160 5658 war 4171 with 3326 the saints 40, and 2532 to overcome 3528 5658 them 846: and 2532 power 1849 was given 1325 5681 him 846 over 1909 all 3956 kindreds 5443, and 2532 tongues 1100, and 2532 nations 1484. 

13:8 And 2532 all 3956 that dwell 2730 5723 upon 1909 the earth 1093 shall worship 4352 5692 him 846, whose 3739 names 3686 are 1125 0 not 3756 written 1125 5769 in 1722 the book 976 of life 2222 of the Lamb 721 slain 4969 5772 from 575 the foundation 2602 of the world 2889. 

13:9 If any man 1536 have 2192 5719 an ear 3775, let him hear 191 5657. 

13:10 He that 1536 leadeth 4863 5719 into captivity 161 shall go 5217 5719 into 1519 captivity 161: he that 1536 killeth 615 5719 with 1722 the sword 3162 must 1163 5748 be killed 615 5683 with 1722 the sword 3162. Here 5602 is 2076 5748 the patience 5281 and 2532 the faith 4102 of the saints 40. 

13:11 And 2532 I beheld 1492 5627 another 243 beast 2342 coming up 305 5723 out of 1537 the earth 1093; and 2532 he had 2192 5707 two 1417 horns 2768 like 3664 a lamb 721, and 2532 he spake 2980 5707 as 5613 a dragon 1404. 

13:12 And 2532 he exerciseth 4160 5719 all 3956 the power 1849 of the first 4413 beast 2342 before 1799 him 846, and 2532 causeth 4160 5719 the earth 1093 and 2532 them which dwell 2730 5723 therein 1722 846 to 2443 worship 4352 5661 the first 4413 beast 2342, whose 3739 deadly 2288 wound 4127 was healed 2323 5681. 

13:13 And 2532 he doeth 4160 5719 great 3173 wonders 4592, so 2532 that 2443 he maketh 4160 5725 fire 4442 come down 2597 5721 from 1537 heaven 3772 on 1519 the earth 1093 in the sight 1799 of men 444, 

13:14 And 2532 deceiveth 4105 5719 them that dwell 2730 5723 on 1909 the earth 1093 by 1223 [the means of] those miracles 4592 which 3739 he 846 had power 1325 5681 to do 4160 5658 in the sight 1799 of the beast 2342; saying 3004 5723 to them that dwell 2730 5723 on 1909 the earth 1093, that they should make 4160 5658 an image 1504 to the beast 2342, which 3739 had 2192 5719 the wound 4127 by a sword 3162, and 2532 did live 2198 5656. 

13:15 And 2532 he had power 1325 5681 to give 1325 5629 life 4151 unto the image 1504 of the beast 2342, that 2443 the image 1504 of the beast 2342 should 2980 0 both 2532 speak 2980 5661, and 2532 cause 4160 5661 that as many as 3745 would 302 4352 0 not 3361 worship 4352 5661 the image 1504 of the beast 2342 should be killed 2443 615 5686. 

13:16 And 2532 he causeth 4160 5719 all 3956, both small 3398 and 2532 great 3173, 2532 rich 4145 and 2532 poor 4434, 2532 free 1658 and 2532 bond 1401, to 2443 receive 1325 5661 a mark 5480 in 1909 their right hand 1188 5495, or 2228 in 1909 their 846 foreheads 3359: 

13:17 And 2532 that 2443 no man 3363 might 1410 5741 buy 59 5658 or 2228 sell 4453 5658, save he 1508 that had 2192 5723 the mark 5480, or 2228 the name 3686 of the beast 2342, or 2228 the number 706 of his 846 name 3686. 

13:18 Here 5602 is 2076 5748 wisdom 4678. Let him that hath 2192 5723 understanding 3563 count 5585 5657 the number 706 of the beast 2342: for 1063 it is 2076 5748 the number 706 of a man 444; and 2532 his 846 number 706 [is] Six hundred 1812 threescore 1835 [and] six 1803 5516. 

14:1 And 2532 I looked 1492 5627, and 2532, lo 2400 5628, a Lamb 721 stood 2476 5761 on 1909 the mount 3735 Sion 4622, and 2532 with 3326 him 846 an hundred 1540 forty 5062 [and] four 5064 thousand 5505, having 2192 5723 his 846 Father's 3962 name 3686 written 1125 5772 in 1909 their 848 foreheads 3359. 

14:2 And 2532 I heard 191 5656 a voice 5456 from 1537 heaven 3772, as 5613 the voice 5456 of many 4183 waters 5204, and 2532 as 5613 the voice 5456 of a great 3173 thunder 1027: and 2532 I heard 191 5656 the voice 5456 of harpers 2790 harping 2789 5723 with 1722 their 848 harps 2788: 

14:3 And 2532 they sung 103 5719 as it were 5613 a new 2537 song 5603 before 1799 the throne 2362, and 2532 before 1799 the four 5064 beasts 2226, and 2532 the elders 4245: and 2532 no man 3762 could 1410 5711 learn 3129 5629 that song 5603 but 1508 the hundred 1540 [and] forty 5062 [and] four 5064 thousand 5505, which 3588 were redeemed 59 5772 from 575 the earth 1093. 

14:4 These 3778 are they 1526 5748 which 3739 were 3435 0 not 3756 defiled 3435 5681 with 3326 women 1135; for 1063 they are 1526 5748 virgins 3933. These 3778 are they 1526 5748 which 3588 follow 190 5723 the Lamb 721 whithersoever 3699 302 he goeth 5217 5725. These 3778 were redeemed 59 5681 from 575 among men 444, [being] the firstfruits 536 unto God 2316 and 2532 to the Lamb 721. 

14:5 And 2532 in 1722 their 846 mouth 4750 was found 2147 5681 no 3756 guile 1388: for 1063 they are 1526 5748 without fault 299 before 1799 the throne 2362 of God 2316. 

14:6 And 2532 I saw 1492 5627 another 243 angel 32 fly 4072 5740 in 1722 the midst of heaven 3321, having 2192 5723 the everlasting 166 gospel 2098 to preach 2097 5658 unto them that dwell 2730 5723 on 1909 the earth 1093, and 2532 to every 3956 nation 1484, and 2532 kindred 5443, and 2532 tongue 1100, and 2532 people 2992, 

14:7 Saying 3004 5723 with 1722 a loud 3173 voice 5456, Fear 5399 5676 God 2316, and 2532 give 1325 5628 glory 1391 to him 846; for 3754 the hour 5610 of his 846 judgment 2920 is come 2064 5627: and 2532 worship 4352 5657 him that made 4160 5660 heaven 3772, and 2532 earth 1093, and 2532 the sea 2281, and 2532 the fountains 4077 of waters 5204. 

14:8 And 2532 there followed 190 5656 another 243 angel 32, saying 3004 5723, Babylon 897 is fallen 4098 5627, is fallen 4098 5627, that great 3173 city 4172, because 3754 she made 4222 0 all 3956 nations 1484 drink 4222 5758 of 1537 the wine 3631 of the wrath 2372 of her 848 fornication 4202. 

14:9 And 2532 the third 5154 angel 32 followed 190 5656 them 846, saying 3004 5723 with 1722 a loud 3173 voice 5456, If any man 1536 worship 4352 5719 the beast 2342 and 2532 his 846 image 1504, and 2532 receive 2983 5719 [his] mark 5480 in 1909 his 848 forehead 3359, or 2228 in 1909 his 848 hand 5495, 

14:10 The same 846 2532 shall drink 4095 5695 of 1537 the wine 3631 of the wrath 2372 of God 2316, which 3588 is poured out 2767 5772 without mixture 194 into 1722 the cup 4221 of his 846 indignation 3709; and 2532 he shall be tormented 928 5701 with 1722 fire 4442 and 2532 brimstone 2303 in the presence 1799 of the holy 40 angels 32, and 2532 in the presence 1799 of the Lamb 721: 

14:11 And 2532 the smoke 2586 of their 846 torment 929 ascendeth up 305 5719 for 1519 ever 165 and ever 165: and 2532 they have 2192 5719 no 3756 rest 372 day 2250 nor 2532 night 3571, who 3588 worship 4352 5723 the beast 2342 and 2532 his 846 image 1504, and 2532 whosoever 1536 receiveth 2983 5719 the mark 5480 of his 846 name 3686. 

14:12 Here 5602 is 2076 5748 the patience 5281 of the saints 40: here 5602 [are] they that keep 5083 5723 the commandments 1785 of God 2316, and 2532 the faith 4102 of Jesus 2424. 

14:13 And 2532 I heard 191 5656 a voice 5456 from 1537 heaven 3772 saying 3004 5723 unto me 3427, Write 1125 5657, Blessed 3107 [are] the dead 3498 which 3588 die 599 5723 in 1722 the Lord 2962 from henceforth 534: Yea 3483, saith 3004 5719 the Spirit 4151, that 2443 they may rest 373 5672 from 1537 their 848 labours 2873; and 1161 their 846 works 2041 do follow 190 5719 3326 them 846. 

14:14 And 2532 I looked 1492 5627, and 2532 behold 2400 5628 a white 3022 cloud 3507, and 2532 upon 1909 the cloud 3507 [one] sat 2521 5740 like 3664 unto the Son 5207 of man 444, having 2192 5723 on 1909 his 848 head 2776 a golden 5552 crown 4735, and 2532 in 1722 his 848 hand 5495 a sharp 3691 sickle 1407. 

14:15 And 2532 another 243 angel 32 came 1831 5627 out of 1537 the temple 3485, crying 2896 5723 with 1722 a loud 3173 voice 5456 to him that sat 2521 5740 on 1909 the cloud 3507, Thrust in 3992 5657 thy 4675 sickle 1407, and 2532 reap 2325 5657: for 3754 the time 5610 is come 2064 5627 for thee 4671 to reap 2325 5658; for 3754 the harvest 2326 of the earth 1093 is ripe 3583 5681. 

14:16 And 2532 he that sat 2521 5740 on 1909 the cloud 3507 thrust in 906 5627 his 848 sickle 1407 on 1909 the earth 1093; and 2532 the earth 1093 was reaped 2325 5681. 

14:17 And 2532 another 243 angel 32 came 1831 5627 out of 1537 the temple 3485 which 3588 is in 1722 heaven 3772, he 846 also 2532 having 2192 5723 a sharp 3691 sickle 1407. 

14:18 And 2532 another 243 angel 32 came 1831 5627 out 1537 from the altar 2379, which had 2192 5723 power 1849 over 1909 fire 4442; and 2532 cried 5455 5656 with a loud 3173 cry 2906 to him that had 2192 5723 the sharp 3691 sickle 1407, saying 3004 5723, Thrust in 3992 5657 thy 4675 sharp 3691 sickle 1407, and 2532 gather 5166 5657 the clusters 1009 of the vine of the earth 1093; for 3754 her 846 grapes 4718 are fully ripe 187 5656. 

14:19 And 2532 the angel 32 thrust in 906 5627 his 848 sickle 1407 into 1519 the earth 1093, and 2532 gathered 5166 5656 the vine 288 of the earth 1093, and 2532 cast 906 5627 [it] into 1519 the great 3173 winepress 3025 of the wrath 2372 of God 2316. 

14:20 And 2532 the winepress 3025 was trodden 3961 5681 without 1854 the city 4172, and 2532 blood 129 came 1831 5627 out of 1537 the winepress 3025, even unto 891 the horse 2462 bridles 5469, by the space of 575 a thousand 5507 [and] six hundred 1812 furlongs 4712. 

15:1 And 2532 I saw 1492 5627 another 243 sign 4592 in 1722 heaven 3772, great 3173 and 2532 marvellous 2298, seven 2033 angels 32 having 2192 5723 the seven 2033 last 2078 plagues 4127; for 3754 in 1722 them 846 is filled up 5055 5681 the wrath 2372 of God 2316. 

15:2 And 2532 I saw 1492 5627 as it were 5613 a sea 2281 of glass 5193 mingled 3396 5772 with fire 4442: and 2532 them that had gotten the victory 3528 5723 over 1537 the beast 2342, and 2532 over 1537 his 846 image 1504, and 2532 over 1537 his 846 mark 5480, [and] over 1537 the number 706 of his 846 name 3686, stand 2476 5761 on 1909 the sea 2281 of glass 5193, having 2192 5723 the harps 2788 of God 2316. 

15:3 And 2532 they sing 103 5719 the song 5603 of Moses 3475 the servant 1401 of God 2316, and 2532 the song 5603 of the Lamb 721, saying 3004 5723, Great 3173 and 2532 marvellous 2298 [are] thy 4675 works 2041, Lord 2962 God 2316 Almighty 3841; just 1342 and 2532 true 228 [are] thy 4675 ways 3598, thou King 935 of saints 40. 

15:4 Who 5101 shall 5399 0 not 3364 fear 5399 5680 thee 4571, O Lord 2962, and 2532 glorify 1392 5661 thy 4675 name 3686? for 3754 [thou] only 3441 [art] holy 3741: for 3754 all 3956 nations 1484 shall come 2240 5692 and 2532 worship 4352 5692 before 1799 thee 4675; for 3754 thy 4675 judgments 1345 are made manifest 5319 5681. 

15:5 And 2532 after 3326 that 5023 I looked 1492 5627, and 2532, behold 2400 5628, the temple 3485 of the tabernacle 4633 of the testimony 3142 in 1722 heaven 3772 was opened 455 5648: 

15:6 And 2532 the seven 2033 angels 32 came 1831 5627 out of 1537 the temple 3485, having 2192 5723 the seven 2033 plagues 4127, clothed 1746 5765 in pure 2513 and 2532 white 2986 linen 3043, and 2532 having their breasts 4738 girded 4024 5772 with 4012 golden 5552 girdles 2223. 

15:7 And 2532 one 1520 of 1537 the four 5064 beasts 2226 gave 1325 5656 unto the seven 2033 angels 32 seven 2033 golden 5552 vials 5357 full 1073 5723 of the wrath 2372 of God 2316, who 3588 liveth 2198 5723 for 1519 ever 165 and ever 165. 

15:8 And 2532 the temple 3485 was filled 1072 5681 with smoke 2586 from 1537 the glory 1391 of God 2316, and 2532 from 1537 his 846 power 1411; and 2532 no man 3762 was able 1410 5711 to enter 1525 5629 into 1519 the temple 3485, till 891 the seven 2033 plagues 4127 of the seven 2033 angels 32 were fulfilled 5055 5686. 

16:1 And 2532 I heard 191 5656 a great 3173 voice 5456 out of 1537 the temple 3485 saying 3004 5723 to the seven 2033 angels 32, Go your ways 5217 5720, and 2532 pour out 1632 5657 the vials 5357 of the wrath 2372 of God 2316 upon 1519 the earth 1093. 

16:2 And 2532 the first 4413 went 565 5627, and 2532 poured out 1632 5656 his 848 vial 5357 upon 1909 the earth 1093; and 2532 there fell 1096 5633 a noisome 2556 and 2532 grievous 4190 sore 1668 upon 1519 the men 444 which 3588 had 2192 5723 the mark 5480 of the beast 2342, and 2532 [upon] them which worshipped 4352 5723 his 846 image 1504. 

16:3 And 2532 the second 1208 angel 32 poured out 1632 5656 his 848 vial 5357 upon 1519 the sea 2281; and 2532 it became 1096 5633 as 5613 the blood 129 of a dead 3498 [man]: and 2532 every 3956 living 2198 5723 soul 5590 died 599 5627 in 1722 the sea 2281. 

16:4 And 2532 the third 5154 angel 32 poured out 1632 5656 his 848 vial 5357 upon 1519 the rivers 4215 and 2532 1519 fountains 4077 of waters 5204; and 2532 they became 1096 5633 blood 129. 

16:5 And 2532 I heard 191 5656 the angel 32 of the waters 5204 say 3004 5723, Thou art 1488 5748 righteous 1342, O Lord 2962, which 3588 art 3801, and 2532 wast 2258 5713 5625 3801, and 2532 shalt be 3741 5706 5625 3801, because 3754 thou hast judged 2919 5656 thus 5023. 

16:6 For 3754 they have shed 1632 5656 the blood 129 of saints 40 and 2532 prophets 4396, and 2532 thou hast given 1325 5656 them 846 blood 129 to drink 4095 5629; for 1063 they are 1526 5748 worthy 514. 

16:7 And 2532 I heard 191 5656 another 243 out of 1537 the altar 2379 say 3004 5723, Even so 3483, Lord 2962 God 2316 Almighty 3841, true 228 and 2532 righteous 1342 [are] thy 4675 judgments 2920. 

16:8 And 2532 the fourth 5067 angel 32 poured out 1632 5656 his 848 vial 5357 upon 1909 the sun 2246; and 2532 power was given 1325 5681 unto him 846 to scorch 2739 5658 men 444 with 1722 fire 4442. 

16:9 And 2532 men 444 were scorched 2739 5681 with great 3173 heat 2738, and 2532 blasphemed 987 5656 the name 3686 of God 2316, which 3588 hath 2192 5723 power 1849 over 1909 these 5025 plagues 4127: and 2532 they repented 3340 5656 not 3756 to give 1325 5629 him 846 glory 1391. 

16:10 And 2532 the fifth 3991 angel 32 poured out 1632 5656 his 848 vial 5357 upon 1909 the seat 2362 of the beast 2342; and 2532 his 846 kingdom 932 was 1096 5633 full of darkness 4656 5772; and 2532 they gnawed 3145 5711 their 848 tongues 1100 for 1537 pain 4192, 

16:11 And 2532 blasphemed 987 5656 the God 2316 of heaven 3772 because of 1537 their 848 pains 4192 and 2532 1537 their 848 sores 1668, and 2532 repented 3340 5656 not 3756 of 1537 their 848 deeds 2041. 

16:12 And 2532 the sixth 1623 angel 32 poured out 1632 5656 his 848 vial 5357 upon 1909 the great 3173 river 4215 Euphrates 2166; and 2532 the water 5204 thereof 846 was dried up 3583 5681, that 2443 the way 3598 of the kings 935 of 575 the east 395 2246 might be prepared 2090 5686. 

16:13 And 2532 I saw 1492 5627 three 5140 unclean 169 spirits 4151 like 3664 frogs 944 [come] out of 1537 the mouth 4750 of the dragon 1404, and 2532 out of 1537 the mouth 4750 of the beast 2342, and 2532 out of 1537 the mouth 4750 of the false prophet 5578. 

16:14 For 1063 they are 1526 5748 the spirits 4151 of devils 1142, working 4160 5723 miracles 4592, [which] go forth 1607 5738 5625 1607 5736 unto 1909 the kings 935 of the earth 1093 and 2532 of the whole 3650 world 3625, to gather 4863 5629 them 846 to 1519 the battle 4171 of that 1565 great 3173 day 2250 of God 2316 Almighty 3841. 

16:15 Behold 2400 5628, I come 2064 5736 as 5613 a thief 2812. Blessed 3107 [is] he that watcheth 1127 5723, and 2532 keepeth 5083 5723 his 848 garments 2440, lest 3363 he walk 4043 5725 naked 1131, and 2532 they see 991 5725 his 846 shame 808. 

16:16 And 2532 he gathered 4863 0 them 846 together 4863 5627 into 1519 a place 5117 called 2564 5746 in the Hebrew tongue 1447 Armageddon 717. 

16:17 And 2532 the seventh 1442 angel 32 poured out 1632 5656 his 848 vial 5357 into 1519 the air 109; and 2532 there came 1831 5627 a great 3173 voice 5456 out of 575 the temple 3485 of heaven 3772, from 575 the throne 2362, saying 3004 5723, It is done 1096 5754. 

16:18 And 2532 there were 1096 5633 voices 5456, and 2532 thunders 1027, and 2532 lightnings 796; and 2532 there was 1096 5633 a great 3173 earthquake 4578, such as 3634 was 1096 5633 not 3756 since 3739 575 men 444 were 1096 5633 upon 1909 the earth 1093, so mighty 5082 an earthquake 4578, [and] so 3779 great 3173. 

16:19 And 2532 the great 3173 city 4172 was divided 1096 5633 into 1519 three 5140 parts 3313, and 2532 the cities 4172 of the nations 1484 fell 4098 5627: and 2532 great 3173 Babylon 897 came in remembrance 3415 5681 before 1799 God 2316, to give 1325 5629 unto her 846 the cup 4221 of the wine 3631 of the fierceness 2372 of his 848 wrath 3709. 

16:20 And 2532 every 3956 island 3520 fled away 5343 5627, and 2532 the mountains 3735 were 2147 0 not 3756 found 2147 5681. 

16:21 And 2532 there fell 2597 5719 upon 1909 men 444 a great 3173 hail 5464 out of 1537 heaven 3772, [every stone] about 5613 the weight of a talent 5006: and 2532 men 444 blasphemed 987 5656 God 2316 because of 1537 the plague 4127 of the hail 5464; for 3754 the plague 4127 thereof 846 was 2076 5748 exceeding 4970 great 3173. 

17:1 And 2532 there came 2064 5627 one 1520 of 1537 the seven 2033 angels 32 which 3588 had 2192 5723 the seven 2033 vials 5357, and 2532 talked 2980 5656 with 3326 me 1700, saying 3004 5723 unto me 3427, Come hither 1204 5773; I will shew 1166 5692 unto thee 4671 the judgment 2917 of the great 3173 whore 4204 that sitteth 2521 5740 upon 1909 many 4183 waters 5204: 

17:2 With 3326 whom 3739 the kings 935 of the earth 1093 have committed fornication 4203 5656, and 2532 the inhabitants 2730 5723 of the earth 1093 have been made drunk 3184 5681 with 1537 the wine 3631 of her 846 fornication 4202. 

17:3 So 2532 he carried 667 0 me 3165 away 667 5656 in 1722 the spirit 4151 into 1519 the wilderness 2048: and 2532 I saw 1492 5627 a woman 1135 sit 2521 5740 upon 1909 a scarlet coloured 2847 beast 2342, full of 1073 5723 names 3686 of blasphemy 988, having 2192 5723 seven 2033 heads 2776 and 2532 ten 1176 horns 2768. 

17:4 And 2532 the woman 1135 was arrayed 4016 5772 in purple 4209 and 2532 scarlet colour 2847, and 2532 decked 5558 5772 with gold 5557 and 2532 precious 5093 stones 3037 and 2532 pearls 3135, having 2192 5723 a golden 5552 cup 4221 in 1722 her 848 hand 5495 full of 1073 5723 abominations 946 and 2532 filthiness 168 of her 848 fornication 4202: 

17:5 And 2532 upon 1909 her 848 forehead 3359 [was] a name 3686 written 1125 5772, MYSTERY 3466, BABYLON 897 THE GREAT 3173, THE MOTHER 3384 OF HARLOTS 4204 AND 2532 ABOMINATIONS 946 OF THE EARTH 1093. 

17:6 And 2532 I saw 1492 5627 the woman 1135 drunken 3184 5723 with 1537 the blood 129 of the saints 40, and 2532 with 1537 the blood 129 of the martyrs 3144 of Jesus 2424: and 2532 when I saw 1492 5631 her 846, I wondered 2296 5656 with great 3173 admiration 2295. 

17:7 And 2532 the angel 32 said 2036 5627 unto me 3427, Wherefore 1302 didst thou marvel 2296 5656? I 1473 will tell 2046 5692 thee 4671 the mystery 3466 of the woman 1135, and 2532 of the beast 2342 that carrieth 941 5723 her 846, which 3588 hath 2192 5723 the seven 2033 heads 2776 and 2532 ten 1176 horns 2768. 

17:8 The beast 2342 that 3739 thou sawest 1492 5627 was 2258 5713, and 2532 is 2076 5748 not 3756; and 2532 shall 3195 5719 ascend 305 5721 out of 1537 the bottomless pit 12, and 2532 go 5217 5721 into 1519 perdition 684: and 2532 they that dwell 2730 5723 on 1909 the earth 1093 shall wonder 2296 5695, whose 3739 names 3686 were 1125 0 not 3756 written 1125 5769 in 1909 the book 975 of life 2222 from 575 the foundation 2602 of the world 2889, when they behold 991 5723 the beast 2342 that was 3748 2258 5713, and 2532 is 2076 5748 not 3756, and yet 2539 is 2076 5748. 

17:9 And here 5602 [is] the mind 3563 which 3588 hath 2192 5723 wisdom 4678. The seven 2033 heads 2776 are 1526 5748 seven 2033 mountains 3735, on 1909 which 846 the woman 1135 sitteth 2521 5736 3699. 

17:10 And 2532 there are 1526 5748 seven 2033 kings 935: five 4002 are fallen 4098 5627, and 2532 one 1520 is 2076 5748, [and] the other 243 is 2064 0 not yet 3768 come 2064 5627; and 2532 when 3752 he cometh 2064 5632, he 846 must 1163 5748 continue 3306 5658 a short space 3641. 

17:11 And 2532 the beast 2342 that 3739 was 2258 5713, and 2532 is 2076 5748 not 3756, even 2532 he 846 is 2076 5748 the eighth 3590, and 2532 is 2076 5748 of 1537 the seven 2033, and 2532 goeth 5217 5719 into 1519 perdition 684. 

17:12 And 2532 the ten 1176 horns 2768 which 3739 thou sawest 1492 5627 are 1526 5748 ten 1176 kings 935, which 3748 have received 2983 5627 no 3768 0 kingdom 932 as yet 3768; but 235 receive 2983 5719 power 1849 as 5613 kings 935 one 3391 hour 5610 with 3326 the beast 2342. 

17:13 These 3778 have 2192 5719 one 3391 mind 1106, and 2532 shall give 1239 5719 their 1438 power 1411 and 2532 strength 1849 unto the beast 2342. 

17:14 These 3778 shall make war 4170 5692 with 3326 the Lamb 721, and 2532 the Lamb 721 shall overcome 3528 5692 them 846: for 3754 he is 2076 5748 Lord 2962 of lords 2962, and 2532 King 935 of kings 935: and 2532 they that are with 3326 him 846 [are] called 2822, and 2532 chosen 1588, and 2532 faithful 4103. 

17:15 And 2532 he saith 3004 5719 unto me 3427, The waters 5204 which 3739 thou sawest 1492 5627, where 3757 the whore 4204 sitteth 2521 5736, are 1526 5748 peoples 2992, and 2532 multitudes 3793, and 2532 nations 1484, and 2532 tongues 1100. 

17:16 And 2532 the ten 1176 horns 2768 which 3739 thou sawest 1492 5627 upon 1909 the beast 2342, these 3778 shall hate 3404 5692 the whore 4204, and 2532 shall make 4160 5692 her 846 desolate 2049 5772 and 2532 naked 1131, and 2532 shall eat 5315 5688 her 846 flesh 4561, and 2532 burn 2618 5692 her 846 with 1722 fire 4442. 

17:17 For 1063 God 2316 hath put 1325 5656 in 1519 their 846 hearts 2588 to fulfil 4160 5658 his 848 will 1106, and 2532 to agree 4160 5658 3391 1106, and 2532 give 1325 5629 their 848 kingdom 932 unto the beast 2342, until 891 the words 4487 of God 2316 shall be fulfilled 5055 5686. 

17:18 And 2532 the woman 1135 which 3739 thou sawest 1492 5627 is 2076 5748 that great 3173 city 4172, which 3588 reigneth 2192 5723 932 over 1909 the kings 935 of the earth 1093. 

18:1 And 2532 after 3326 these things 5023 I saw 1492 5627 another 243 angel 32 come down 2597 5723 from 1537 heaven 3772, having 2192 5723 great 3173 power 1849; and 2532 the earth 1093 was lightened 5461 5681 with 1537 his 846 glory 1391. 

18:2 And 2532 he cried 2896 5656 mightily 2479 with 1722 a strong 3173 voice 5456, saying 3004 5723, Babylon 897 the great 3173 is fallen 4098 5627, is fallen 4098 5627, and 2532 is become 1096 5633 the habitation 2732 of devils 1142, and 2532 the hold 5438 of every 3956 foul 169 spirit 4151, and 2532 a cage 5438 of every 3956 unclean 169 and 2532 hateful 3404 5772 bird 3732. 

18:3 For 3754 all 3956 nations 1484 have drunk 4095 5758 of 1537 the wine 3631 of the wrath 2372 of her 846 fornication 4202, and 2532 the kings 935 of the earth 1093 have committed fornication 4203 5656 with 3326 her 846, and 2532 the merchants 1713 of the earth 1093 are waxed rich 4147 5656 through 1537 the abundance 1411 of her 846 delicacies 4764. 

18:4 And 2532 I heard 191 5656 another 243 voice 5456 from 1537 heaven 3772, saying 3004 5723, Come 1831 5628 out of 1537 her 846, my 3450 people 2992, that 3363 0 ye be 4790 0 not 3363 partakers 4790 5661 of her 846 sins 266, and 2532 that 3363 0 ye receive 2983 5632 not 3363 of 1537 her 846 plagues 4127. 

18:5 For 3754 her 846 sins 266 have reached 190 5656 5625 2853 5681 unto 891 heaven 3772, and 2532 God 2316 hath remembered 3421 5656 her 846 iniquities 92. 

18:6 Reward 591 5628 her 846 even 2532 as 5613 she rewarded 591 5656 you 5213, and 2532 double 1363 5657 unto her 846 double 1362 according to 2596 her 846 works 2041: in 1722 the cup 4221 which 3739 she hath filled 2767 5656 fill 2767 5657 to her 846 double 1362. 

18:7 How much 3745 she hath glorified 1392 5656 herself 1438, and 2532 lived deliciously 4763 5656, so much 5118 torment 929 and 2532 sorrow 3997 give 1325 5628 her 846: for 3754 she saith 3004 5719 in 1722 her 848 heart 2588, I sit 2521 5736 a queen 938, and 2532 am 1510 5748 no 3756 widow 5503, and 2532 shall see 1492 5632 no 3364 sorrow 3997. 

18:8 Therefore 5124 1223 shall 2240 0 her 846 plagues 4127 come 2240 5692 in 1722 one 3391 day 2250, death 2288, and 2532 mourning 3997, and 2532 famine 3042; and 2532 she shall be utterly burned 2618 5701 with 1722 fire 4442: for 3754 strong 2478 [is] the Lord 2962 God 2316 who 3588 judgeth 2919 5723 her 846. 

18:9 And 2532 the kings 935 of the earth 1093, who 3588 have committed fornication 4203 5660 and 2532 lived deliciously 4763 5660 with 3326 her 846, shall bewail 2799 5695 her 846, and 2532 lament 2875 5695 for 1909 her 846, when 3752 they shall see 991 5725 the smoke 2586 of her 846 burning 4451, 

18:10 Standing 2476 5761 afar 3113 off 575 for 1223 the fear 5401 of her 846 torment 929, saying 3004 5723, Alas 3759, alas 3759, that great 3173 city 4172 Babylon 897, that mighty 2478 city 4172! for 3754 in 1722 one 3391 hour 5610 is 2064 0 thy 4675 judgment 2920 come 2064 5627. 

18:11 And 2532 the merchants 1713 of the earth 1093 shall weep 2799 5719 and 2532 mourn 3996 5719 over 1909 her 846; for 3754 no man 3762 buyeth 59 5719 their 846 merchandise 1117 any more 3765: 

18:12 The merchandise 1117 of gold 5557, and 2532 silver 696, and 2532 precious 5093 stones 3037, and 2532 of pearls 3135, and 2532 fine linen 1040, and 2532 purple 4209, and 2532 silk 4596, and 2532 scarlet 2847, and 2532 all 3956 thyine 2367 wood 3586, and 2532 all manner 3956 vessels 4632 of ivory 1661, and 2532 all manner 3956 vessels 4632 of 1537 most precious 5093 wood 3586, and 2532 of brass 5475, and 2532 iron 4604, and 2532 marble 3139, 

18:13 And 2532 cinnamon 2792, and 2532 odours 2368, and 2532 ointments 3464, and 2532 frankincense 3030, and 2532 wine 3631, and 2532 oil 1637, and 2532 fine flour 4585, and 2532 wheat 4621, and 2532 beasts 2934, and 2532 sheep 4263, and 2532 horses 2462, and 2532 chariots 4480, and 2532 slaves 4983, and 2532 souls 5590 of men 444. 

18:14 And 2532 the fruits 3703 that thy 4675 soul 5590 lusted after 1939 are departed 565 5627 from 575 thee 4675, and 2532 all things 3956 which 3588 were dainty 3045 and 2532 goodly 2986 are departed 565 5627 from 575 thee 4675, and 2532 thou shalt find 2147 5661 them 846 no more 3765 at all 3364. 

18:15 The merchants 1713 of these things 5130, which 3588 were made rich 4147 5660 by 575 her 846, shall stand 2476 5695 afar 3113 off 575 for 1223 the fear 5401 of her 846 torment 929, weeping 2799 5723 and 2532 wailing 3996 5723, 

18:16 And 2532 saying 3004 5723, Alas 3759, alas 3759, that great 3173 city 4172, that was clothed in 4016 5772 fine linen 1039, and 2532 purple 4210, and 2532 scarlet 2847, and 2532 decked 5558 5772 with 1722 gold 5557, and 2532 precious 5093 stones 3037, and 2532 pearls 3135! 

18:17 For 3754 in one 3391 hour 5610 so great 5118 riches 4149 is come to nought 2049 5681. And 2532 every 3956 shipmaster 2942, and 2532 all 3956 the company 3658 in 1909 ships 4143, and 2532 sailors 3492, and 2532 as many as 3745 trade 2038 5740 by sea 2281, stood 2476 5627 afar 3113 off 575, 

18:18 And 2532 cried 2896 5707 when they saw 3708 5723 the smoke 2586 of her 846 burning 4451, saying 3004 5723, What 5101 [city is] like 3664 unto this great 3173 city 4172! 

18:19 And 2532 they cast 906 5627 dust 5522 on 1909 their 848 heads 2776, and 2532 cried 2896 5707, weeping 2799 5723 and 2532 wailing 3996 5723, saying 3004 5723, Alas 3759, alas 3759, that great 3173 city 4172, wherein 1722 3739 were made rich 4147 5656 all 3956 that had 2192 5723 ships 4143 in 1722 the sea 2281 by reason of 1537 her 846 costliness 5094! for 3754 in one 3391 hour 5610 is she made desolate 2049 5681. 

18:20 Rejoice 2165 5744 over 1909 her 846, [thou] heaven 3772, and 2532 [ye] holy 40 apostles 652 and 2532 prophets 4396; for 3754 God 2316 hath avenged 2917 2919 5656 you 5216 on 1537 her 846. 

18:21 And 2532 a 1520 mighty 2478 angel 32 took up 142 5656 a stone 3037 like 5613 a great 3173 millstone 3458, and 2532 cast 906 5627 [it] into 1519 the sea 2281, saying 3004 5723, Thus 3779 with violence 3731 shall 906 0 that great 3173 city 4172 Babylon 897 be thrown down 906 5701, and 2532 shall be found 2147 5686 no more 3364 at all 2089. 

18:22 And 2532 the voice 5456 of harpers 2790, and 2532 musicians 3451, and 2532 of pipers 834, and 2532 trumpeters 4538, shall be heard 191 5686 no more 3364 at all 2089 in 1722 thee 4671; and 2532 no 3364 3956 craftsman 5079, of whatsoever 3956 craft 5078 [he be], shall be found 2147 5686 any more 2089 in 1722 thee 4671; and 2532 the sound 5456 of a millstone 3458 shall be heard 191 5686 no more 3364 at all 2089 in 1722 thee 4671; 

18:23 And 2532 the light 5457 of a candle 3088 shall shine 5316 5652 no more 3364 at all 2089 in 1722 thee 4671; and 2532 the voice 5456 of the bridegroom 3566 and 2532 of the bride 3565 shall be heard 191 5686 no more 3364 at all 2089 in 1722 thee 4671: for 3754 thy 4675 merchants 1713 were 2258 5713 the great men 3175 of the earth 1093; for 3754 by 1722 thy 4675 sorceries 5331 were 4105 0 all 3956 nations 1484 deceived 4105 5681. 

18:24 And 2532 in 1722 her 846 was found 2147 5681 the blood 129 of prophets 4396, and 2532 of saints 40, and 2532 of all 3956 that were slain 4969 5772 upon 1909 the earth 1093. 

19:1 And 2532 after 3326 these things 5023 I heard 191 5656 a great 3173 voice 5456 of much 4183 people 3793 in 1722 heaven 3772, saying 3004 5723, Alleluia 239; Salvation 4991, and 2532 glory 1391, and 2532 honour 5092, and 2532 power 1411, unto the Lord 2962 our 2257 God 2316: 

19:2 For 3754 true 228 and 2532 righteous 1342 [are] his 846 judgments 2920: for 3754 he hath judged 2919 5656 the great 3173 whore 4204, which 3748 did corrupt 5351 5707 the earth 1093 with 1722 her 848 fornication 4202, and 2532 hath avenged 1556 5656 the blood 129 of his 848 servants 1401 at 1537 her 846 hand 5495. 

19:3 And 2532 again 1208 they said 2046 5758, Alleluia 239. And 2532 her 846 smoke 2586 rose up 305 5719 for 1519 ever 165 and ever 165. 

19:4 And 2532 the four 5064 and 2532 twenty 1501 elders 4245 and 2532 the four 5064 beasts 2226 fell down 4098 5627 and 2532 worshipped 4352 5656 God 2316 that sat 2521 5740 on 1909 the throne 2362, saying 3004 5723, Amen 281; Alleluia 239. 

19:5 And 2532 a voice 5456 came 1831 5627 out of 1537 the throne 2362, saying 3004 5723, Praise 134 5720 our 2257 God 2316, all ye 3956 his 846 servants 1401, and 2532 ye that fear 5399 5740 him 846, both 2532 small 3398 and 2532 great 3173. 

19:6 And 2532 I heard 191 5656 as it were 5613 the voice 5456 of a great 4183 multitude 3793, and 2532 as 5613 the voice 5456 of many 4183 waters 5204, and 2532 as 5613 the voice 5456 of mighty 2478 thunderings 1027, saying 3004 5723, Alleluia 239: for 3754 the Lord 2962 God 2316 omnipotent 3841 reigneth 936 5656. 

19:7 Let us be glad 5463 5725 and 2532 rejoice 21 5741, and 2532 give 1325 5632 honour 1391 to him 846: for 3754 the marriage 1062 of the Lamb 721 is come 2064 5627, and 2532 his 846 wife 1135 hath made 2090 0 herself 1438 ready 2090 5656. 

19:8 And 2532 to her 846 was granted 1325 5681 that 2443 she should be arrayed 4016 5643 in fine linen 1039, clean 2513 and 2532 white 2986: for 1063 the fine linen 1039 is 2076 5748 the righteousness 1345 of saints 40. 

19:9 And 2532 he saith 3004 5719 unto me 3427, Write 1125 5657, Blessed 3107 [are] they which are called 2564 5772 unto 1519 the marriage 1062 supper 1173 of the Lamb 721. And 2532 he saith 3004 5719 unto me 3427, These 3778 are 1526 5748 the true 228 sayings 3056 of God 2316. 

19:10 And 2532 I fell 4098 5627 at 1715 his 846 feet 4228 to worship 4352 5658 him 846. And 2532 he said 3004 5719 unto me 3427, See 3708 5720 [thou do it] not 3361: I am 1510 5748 thy 4675 fellowservant 4889, and 2532 of thy 4675 brethren 80 that have 2192 5723 the testimony 3141 of Jesus 2424: worship 4352 5657 God 2316: for 1063 the testimony 3141 of Jesus 2424 is 2076 5748 the spirit 4151 of prophecy 4394. 

19:11 And 2532 I saw 1492 5627 heaven 3772 opened 455 5772, and 2532 behold 2400 5628 a white 3022 horse 2462; and 2532 he that sat 2521 5740 upon 1909 him 846 [was] called 2564 5746 Faithful 4103 and 2532 True 228, and 2532 in 1722 righteousness 1343 he doth judge 2919 5719 and 2532 make war 4170 5719. 

19:12 1161 His 846 eyes 3788 [were] as 5613 a flame 5395 of fire 4442, and 2532 on 1909 his 846 head 2776 [were] many 4183 crowns 1238; and he had 2192 5723 a name 3686 written 1125 5772, that 3739 no man 3762 knew 1492 5758, but 1508 he himself 846. 

19:13 And 2532 he [was] clothed 4016 5772 with a vesture 2440 dipped 911 5772 in blood 129: and 2532 his 846 name 3686 is called 2564 5743 The Word 3056 of God 2316. 

19:14 And 2532 the armies 4753 [which were 3588] in 1722 heaven 3772 followed 190 5707 him 846 upon 1909 white 3022 horses 2462, clothed 1746 5765 in fine linen 1039, white 3022 and 2532 clean 2513. 

19:15 And 2532 out of 1537 his 846 mouth 4750 goeth 1607 5736 a sharp 3691 sword 4501, that 2443 with 1722 it 846 he should smite 3960 5661 the nations 1484: and 2532 he shall rule 4165 5692 them 846 with 1722 a rod 4464 of iron 4603: and 2532 he treadeth 3961 5719 the winepress 3025 3631 of the fierceness 2372 and 2532 wrath 3709 of Almighty 3841 God 2316. 

19:16 And 2532 he hath 2192 5719 on 1909 [his] vesture 2440 and 2532 on 1909 his 848 thigh 3382 a name 3686 written 1125 5772, KING 935 OF KINGS 935, AND 2532 LORD 2962 OF LORDS 2962. 

19:17 And 2532 I saw 1492 5627 an 1520 angel 32 standing 2476 5761 in 1722 the sun 2246; and 2532 he cried 2896 5656 with a loud 3173 voice 5456, saying 3004 5723 to all 3956 the fowls 3732 that fly 4072 5740 in 1722 the midst of heaven 3321, Come 1205 5773 and 2532 gather yourselves together 4863 5744 unto 1519 the supper 1173 of the great 3173 God 2316; 

19:18 That 2443 ye may eat 5315 5632 the flesh 4561 of kings 935, and 2532 the flesh 4561 of captains 5506, and 2532 the flesh 4561 of mighty men 2478, and 2532 the flesh 4561 of horses 2462, and 2532 of them that sit 2521 5740 on 1909 them 846, and 2532 the flesh 4561 of all 3956 [men, both] free 1658 and 2532 bond 1401, both 2532 small 3398 and 2532 great 3173. 

19:19 And 2532 I saw 1492 5627 the beast 2342, and 2532 the kings 935 of the earth 1093, and 2532 their 846 armies 4753, gathered together 4863 5772 to make 4160 5658 war 4171 against 3326 him that sat 2521 5740 on 1909 the horse 2462, and 2532 against 3326 his 846 army 4753. 

19:20 And 2532 the beast 2342 was taken 4084 5681, and 2532 with 3326 him 5127 the false prophet 5578 that wrought 4160 5660 miracles 4592 before 1799 him 846, with 1722 which 3739 he deceived 4105 5656 them that had received 2983 5631 the mark 5480 of the beast 2342, and 2532 them that worshipped 4352 5723 his 846 image 1504. These both 1417 were cast 906 5681 alive 2198 5723 into 1519 a lake 3041 of fire 4442 burning 2545 5746 with 1722 brimstone 2303. 

19:21 And 2532 the remnant 3062 were slain 615 5681 with 1722 the sword 4501 of him that sat 2521 5740 upon 1909 the horse 2462, which 3588 [sword] proceeded 1607 5740 out of 1537 his 846 mouth 4750: and 2532 all 3956 the fowls 3732 were filled 5526 5681 with 1537 their 846 flesh 4561. 

20:1 And 2532 I saw 1492 5627 an angel 32 come down 2597 5723 from 1537 heaven 3772, having 2192 5723 the key 2807 of the bottomless pit 12 and 2532 a great 3173 chain 254 in 1909 his 848 hand 5495. 

20:2 And 2532 he laid hold on 2902 5656 the dragon 1404, that old 744 serpent 3789, which 3739 is 2076 5748 the Devil 1228, and 2532 Satan 4567, and 2532 bound 1210 5656 him 846 a thousand 5507 years 2094, 

20:3 And 2532 cast 906 5627 him 846 into 1519 the bottomless pit 12, and 2532 shut 2808 0 him 846 up 2808 5656, and 2532 set a seal 4972 5656 upon 1883 him 846, that 3363 0 he should deceive 4105 5661 the nations 1484 no 3363 more 2089, till 891 the thousand 5507 years 2094 should be fulfilled 5055 5686: and 2532 after 3326 that 5023 he 846 must 1163 5748 be loosed 3089 5683 a little 3398 season 5550. 

20:4 And 2532 I saw 1492 5627 thrones 2362, and 2532 they sat 2523 5656 upon 1909 them 846, and 2532 judgment 2917 was given 1325 5681 unto them 846: and 2532 [I saw] the souls 5590 of them that were beheaded 3990 5772 for 1223 the witness 3141 of Jesus 2424, and 2532 for 1223 the word 3056 of God 2316, and 2532 which 3748 had 4352 0 not 3756 worshipped 4352 5656 the beast 2342, neither 3777 his 846 image 1504, 2532 neither 3756 had received 2983 5627 [his] mark 5480 upon 1909 their 848 foreheads 3359, or 2532 in 1909 their 848 hands 5495; and 2532 they lived 2198 5656 and 2532 reigned 936 5656 with 3326 Christ 5547 a thousand 5507 years 2094. 

20:5 But 1161 the rest 3062 of the dead 3498 lived 326 0 not 3756 again 326 5656 until 2193 the thousand 5507 years 2094 were finished 5055 5686. This 3778 [is] the first 4413 resurrection 386. 

20:6 Blessed 3107 and 2532 holy 40 [is] he that hath 2192 5723 part 3313 in 1722 the first 4413 resurrection 386: on 1909 such 5130 the second 1208 death 2288 hath 2192 5719 no 3756 power 1849, but 235 they shall be 2071 5704 priests 2409 of God 2316 and 2532 of Christ 5547, and 2532 shall reign 936 5692 with him 3326 a thousand 5507 years 2094. 

20:7 And 2532 when 3752 the thousand 5507 years 2094 are expired 5055 5686, Satan 4567 shall be loosed 3089 5701 out of 1537 his 848 prison 5438, 

20:8 And 2532 shall go out 1831 5695 to deceive 4105 5658 the nations 1484 which 3588 are in 1722 the four 5064 quarters 1137 of the earth 1093, Gog 1136 and 2532 Magog 3098, to gather 4863 0 them 846 together 4863 5629 to 1519 battle 4171: the number 706 of whom 3739 [is] as 5613 the sand 285 of the sea 2281. 

20:9 And 2532 they went up 305 5627 on 1909 the breadth 4114 of the earth 1093, and 2532 compassed 2944 0 the camp 3925 of the saints 40 about 2944 5656, and 2532 the beloved 25 5772 city 4172: and 2532 fire 4442 came down 2597 5627 from 575 God 2316 out of 1537 heaven 3772, and 2532 devoured 2719 5627 them 846. 

20:10 And 2532 the devil 1228 that deceived 4105 5723 them 846 was cast 906 5681 into 1519 the lake 3041 of fire 4442 and 2532 brimstone 2303, where 3699 the beast 2342 and 2532 the false prophet 5578 [are], and 2532 shall be tormented 928 5701 day 2250 and 2532 night 3571 for 1519 ever 165 and ever 165. 

20:11 And 2532 I saw 1492 5627 a great 3173 white 3022 throne 2362, and 2532 him that sat 2521 5740 on 1909 it 846, from 575 whose 3739 face 4383 the earth 1093 and 2532 the heaven 3772 fled away 5343 5627; and 2532 there was found 2147 5681 no 3756 place 5117 for them 846. 

20:12 And 2532 I saw 1492 5627 the dead 3498, small 3398 and 2532 great 3173, stand 2476 5761 before 1799 God 2316; and 2532 the books 975 were opened 455 5681: and 2532 another 243 book 975 was opened 455 5681, which 3739 is 2076 5748 [the book] of life 2222: and 2532 the dead 3498 were judged 2919 5681 out of 1537 those things which were written 1125 5772 in 1722 the books 975, according to 2596 their 846 works 2041. 

20:13 And 2532 the sea 2281 gave up 1325 5656 the dead 3498 which 3588 were in 1722 it 846; and 2532 death 2288 and 2532 hell 86 delivered up 1325 5656 the dead 3498 which 3588 were in 1722 them 846: and 2532 they were judged 2919 5681 every man 1538 according to 2596 their 846 works 2041. 

20:14 And 2532 death 2288 and 2532 hell 86 were cast 906 5681 into 1519 the lake 3041 of fire 4442. This 3778 is 2076 5748 the second 1208 death 2288. 

20:15 And 2532 whosoever 1536 was 2147 0 not 3756 found 2147 5681 written 1125 5772 in 1722 the book 976 of life 2222 was cast 906 5681 into 1519 the lake 3041 of fire 4442. 

21:1 And 2532 I saw 1492 5627 a new 2537 heaven 3772 and 2532 a new 2537 earth 1093: for 1063 the first 4413 heaven 3772 and 2532 the first 4413 earth 1093 were passed away 3928 5627; and 2532 there was 2076 5748 no 3756 more 2089 sea 2281. 

21:2 And 2532 I 1473 John 2491 saw 1492 5627 the holy 40 city 4172, new 2537 Jerusalem 2419, coming down 2597 5723 from 575 God 2316 out of 1537 heaven 3772, prepared 2090 5772 as 5613 a bride 3565 adorned 2885 5772 for her 848 husband 435. 

21:3 And 2532 I heard 191 5656 a great 3173 voice 5456 out of 1537 heaven 3772 saying 3004 5723, Behold 2400 5628, the tabernacle 4633 of God 2316 [is] with 3326 men 444, and 2532 he will dwell 4637 5692 with 3326 them 846, and 2532 they shall be 2071 5704 his 846 people 2992, and 2532 God 2316 himself 846 shall be 2071 5704 with 3326 them 846, [and be] their 846 God 2316. 

21:4 And 2532 God 2316 shall wipe away 1813 5692 all 3956 tears 1144 from 575 their 846 eyes 3788; and 2532 there shall be 2071 5704 no 3756 more 2089 death 2288, neither 3777 sorrow 3997, nor 3777 crying 2906, neither 3777 3756 shall there be 2071 5704 any more 2089 pain 4192: for 3754 the former things 4413 are passed away 565 5627. 

21:5 And 2532 he that sat 2521 5740 upon 1909 the throne 2362 said 2036 5627, Behold 2400 5628, I make 4160 5719 all things 3956 new 2537. And 2532 he said 3004 5719 unto me 3427, Write 1125 5657: for 3754 these 3778 words 3056 are 1526 5748 true 228 and 2532 faithful 4103. 

21:6 And 2532 he said 2036 5627 unto me 3427, It is done 1096 5754. I 1473 am 1510 5748 Alpha 1 and 2532 Omega 5598, the beginning 746 and 2532 the end 5056. I 1473 will give 1325 5692 unto him that is athirst 1372 5723 of 1537 the fountain 4077 of the water 5204 of life 2222 freely 1432. 

21:7 He that overcometh 3528 5723 shall inherit 2816 5692 all things 3956; and 2532 I will be 2071 5704 his 846 God 2316, and 2532 he shall be 2071 5704 my 3427 son 5207. 

21:8 But 1161 the fearful 1169, and 2532 unbelieving 571, and 2532 the abominable 948 5772, and 2532 murderers 5406, and 2532 whoremongers 4205, and 2532 sorcerers 5332, and 2532 idolaters 1496, and 2532 all 3956 liars 5571, shall have their 846 part 3313 in 1722 the lake 3041 which 3739 burneth 2545 5746 with fire 4442 and 2532 brimstone 2303: which 3588 is 2076 5748 3603 the second 1208 death 2288. 

21:9 And 2532 there came 2064 5627 unto 4314 me 3165 one of 1520 the seven 2033 angels 32 which 3588 had 2192 5723 the seven 2033 vials 5357 full 1073 5723 of the seven 2033 last 2078 plagues 4127, and 2532 talked 2980 5656 with 3326 me 1700, saying 3004 5723, Come hither 1204 5773, I will shew 1166 5692 thee 4671 the bride 3565, the Lamb's 721 wife 1135. 

21:10 And 2532 he carried 667 0 me 3165 away 667 5656 in 1722 the spirit 4151 to 1909 a great 3173 and 2532 high 5308 mountain 3735, and 2532 shewed 1166 5656 me 3427 that great 3173 city 4172, the holy 40 Jerusalem 2419, descending 2597 5723 out of 1537 heaven 3772 from 575 God 2316, 

21:11 Having 2192 5723 the glory 1391 of God 2316: and 2532 her 846 light 5458 [was] like 3664 unto a stone 3037 most precious 5093, even like 5613 a jasper 2393 stone 3037, clear as crystal 2929 5723; 

21:12 And 5037 had 2192 5723 a wall 5038 great 3173 and 2532 high 5308, [and] had 2192 5723 twelve 1427 gates 4440, and 2532 at 1909 the gates 4440 twelve 1427 angels 32, and 2532 names 3686 written thereon 1924 5772, which 3739 are 2076 5748 [the names] of the twelve 1427 tribes 5443 of the children 5207 of Israel 2474: 

21:13 On 575 the east 395 three 5140 gates 4440; on 575 the north 1005 three 5140 gates 4440; on 575 the south 3558 three 5140 gates 4440; and 2532 on 575 the west 1424 three 5140 gates 4440. 

21:14 And 2532 the wall 5038 of the city 4172 had 2192 5723 twelve 1427 foundations 2310, and 2532 in 1722 them 846 the names 3686 of the twelve 1427 apostles 652 of the Lamb 721. 

21:15 And 2532 he that talked 2980 5723 with 3326 me 1700 had 2192 5707 a golden 5552 reed 2563 to 2443 measure 3354 5661 the city 4172, and 2532 the gates 4440 thereof 846, and 2532 the wall 5038 thereof 846. 

21:16 And 2532 the city 4172 lieth 2749 5736 foursquare 5068, and 2532 the length 3372 846 is 2076 5748 as large 5118 as 3745 2532 the breadth 4114: and 2532 he measured 3354 5656 the city 4172 with the reed 2563 1909, twelve 1427 thousand 5505 furlongs 4712. The length 3372 and 2532 the breadth 4114 and 2532 the height 5311 of it 846 are 2076 5748 equal 2470. 

21:17 And 2532 he measured 3354 5656 the wall 5038 thereof 846, an hundred 1540 [and] forty 5062 [and] four 5064 cubits 4083, [according to] the measure 3358 of a man 444, that 3739 is 2076 5748 3603, of the angel 32. 

21:18 And 2532 the building 1739 of the wall 5038 of it 846 was 2258 5713 [of] jasper 2393: and 2532 the city 4172 [was] pure 2513 gold 5553, like 3664 unto clear 2513 glass 5194. 

21:19 And 2532 the foundations 2310 of the wall 5038 of the city 4172 [were] garnished with 2885 5772 all manner of 3956 precious 5093 stones 3037. The first 4413 foundation 2310 [was] jasper 2393; the second 1208, sapphire 4552; the third 5154, a chalcedony 5472; the fourth 5067, an emerald 4665; 

21:20 The fifth 3991, sardonyx 4557; the sixth 1623, sardius 4556; the seventh 1442, chrysolite 5555; the eighth 3590, beryl 969; the ninth 1766, a topaz 5116; the tenth 1182, a chrysoprasus 5556; the eleventh 1734, a jacinth 5192; the twelfth 1428, an amethyst 271. 

21:21 And 2532 the twelve 1427 gates 4440 [were] twelve 1427 pearls 3135; every 1538 303 several 1520 gate 4440 was 2258 5713 of 1537 one 1520 pearl 3135: and 2532 the street 4113 of the city 4172 [was] pure 2513 gold 5553, as it were 5613 transparent 1307 glass 5194. 

21:22 And 2532 I saw 1492 5627 no 3756 temple 3485 therein 1722 846: for 1063 the Lord 2962 God 2316 Almighty 3841 and 2532 the Lamb 721 are 2076 5748 the temple 3485 of it 846. 

21:23 And 2532 the city 4172 had 2192 5719 no 3756 need 5532 of the sun 2246, neither 3761 of the moon 4582, to 2443 shine 5316 5725 in 1722 it 846: for 1063 the glory 1391 of God 2316 did lighten 5461 5656 it 846, and 2532 the Lamb 721 [is] the light 3088 thereof 846. 

21:24 And 2532 the nations 1484 of them which are saved 4982 5746 shall walk 4043 5692 in 1722 the light 5457 of it 846: and 2532 the kings 935 of the earth 1093 do bring 5342 5719 their 848 glory 1391 and 2532 honour 5092 into 1519 it 846. 

21:25 And 2532 the gates 4440 of it 846 shall 2808 0 not 3364 0 be shut 2808 5686 at all 3364 by day 2250: for 1063 there shall be 2071 5704 no 3756 night 3571 there 1563. 

21:26 And 2532 they shall bring 5342 5692 the glory 1391 and 2532 honour 5092 of the nations 1484 into 1519 it 846. 

21:27 And 2532 there shall 1525 0 in no wise 3364 enter 1525 5632 into 1519 it 846 any thing 3956 that defileth 2840 5723, neither 2532 [whatsoever] worketh 4160 5723 abomination 946, or 2532 [maketh] a lie 5579: but 1508 they which are written 1125 5772 in 1722 the Lamb's 721 book 975 of life 2, a. 

22:1 And 2532 he shewed 1166 5656 me 3427 a pure 2513 river 4215 of water 5204 of life 2222, clear 2986 as 5613 crystal 2930, proceeding 1607 5740 out of 1537 the throne 2362 of God 2316 and 2532 of the Lamb 721. 

22:2 In 1722 the midst 3319 of the street 4113 of it 846, and 2532 on either 2532 side 1782 1782 of the river 4215, [was there] the tree 3586 of life 2222, which bare 4160 5723 twelve 1427 [manner of] fruits 2590, [and] yielded 591 5723 her 848 fruit 2590 every 2596 1538 1520 month 3376: and 2532 the leaves 5444 of the tree 3586 [were] for 1519 the healing 2322 of the nations 1484. 

22:3 And 2532 there shall be 2071 5704 no 3756 more 2089 3956 curse 2652: but 2532 the throne 2362 of God 2316 and 2532 of the Lamb 721 shall be 2071 5704 in 1722 it 846; and 2532 his 846 servants 1401 shall serve 3000 5692 him 846: 

22:4 And 2532 they shall see 3700 5695 his 846 face 4383; and 2532 his 846 name 3686 [shall be] in 1909 their 846 foreheads 3359. 

22:5 And 2532 there shall be 2071 5704 no 3756 night 3571 there 1563; and 2532 they need 5532 no 3756 candle 3088 2192 5719, neither 2532 light 5457 of the sun 2246; for 3754 the Lord 2962 God 2316 giveth 5461 0 them 846 light 5461 5719: and 2532 they shall reign 936 5692 for 1519 ever 165 and ever 165. 

22:6 And 2532 he said 2036 5627 unto me 3427, These 3778 sayings 3056 [are] faithful 4103 and 2532 true 228: and 2532 the Lord 2962 God 2316 of the holy 40 prophets 4396 sent 649 5656 his 848 angel 32 to shew 1166 5658 unto his 848 servants 1401 the things which 3739 must 1163 5748 shortly 1722 5034 be done 1096 5635. 

22:7 Behold 2400 5628, I come 2064 5736 quickly 5035: blessed 3107 [is] he that keepeth 5083 5723 the sayings 3056 of the prophecy 4394 of this 5127 book 975. 

22:8 And 2532 I 1473 John 2491 saw 991 5723 these things 5023, and 2532 heard 191 5723 [them]. And 2532 when 3753 I had heard 191 5656 and 2532 seen 991 5656, I fell down 4098 5627 to worship 4352 5658 before 1715 the feet 42 8 of the angel 32 which 3588 shewed 1166 5723 me 3427 these things 5023. 

22:9 Then 2532 saith he 3004 5719 unto me 3427, See 3708 5720 [thou do it] not 3361: for 1063 I am 1510 5748 thy 4675 fellowservant 4889, and 2532 of thy 4675 brethren 80 the prophets 4396, and 2532 of them which keep 5083 5723 the sayings 3056 of this 5127 book 975: worship 4352 5657 God 2316. 

22:10 And 2532 he saith 3004 5719 unto me 3427, Seal 4972 5661 not 3361 the sayings 3056 of the prophecy 4394 of this 5127 book 975: for 3754 the time 2540 is 2076 5748 at hand 1451. 

22:11 He that is unjust 91 5723, let him be unjust 91 5657 still 2089: and 2532 he which is filthy 4510 5723, let him be filthy 4510 5657 still 2089: and 2532 he that is righteous 1342, let him be righteous 1344 5682 still 2089: and 2532 he that is holy 40, let him be holy 37 5682 still 2089. 

22:12 And 2532, behold 2400 5628, I come 2064 5736 quickly 5035; and 2532 my 3450 reward 3408 [is] with 3326 me 1700, to give 591 5629 every man 1538 according as 5613 his 846 work 2041 shall be 2071 5704. 

22:13 I 1473 am 1510 5748 Alpha 1 and 2532 Omega 5598, the beginning 746 and 2532 the end 5056, the first 4413 and 2532 the last 2078. 

22:14 Blessed 3107 [are] they that do 4160 5723 his 846 commandments 1785, that 2443 they 846 may have 2071 5704 right 1849 to 1909 the tree 3586 of life 2222, and 2532 may enter 1525 5632 in through the gates 4440 into 1519 the city 4172. 

22:15 For 1161 without 1854 [are] dogs 2965, and 2532 sorcerers 5333, and 2532 whoremongers 4205, and 2532 murderers 5406, and 2532 idolaters 1496, and 2532 whosoever 3956 loveth 5368 5723 and 2532 maketh 4160 5723 a lie 5579. 

22:16 I 1473 Jesus 2424 have sent 3992 5656 mine 3450 angel 32 to testify 3140 5658 unto you 5213 these things 5023 in 1909 the churches 1577. I 1473 am 1510 5748 the root 4491 and 2532 the offspring 1085 of David 1138, [and] the bright 2986 and 2532 morning 3720 star 792. 

22:17 And 2532 the Spirit 4151 and 2532 the bride 3565 say 3004 5719, Come 2064 5628. And 2532 let him that heareth 191 5723 say 2036 5628, Come 2064 5628. And 2532 let him that is athirst 1372 5723 come 2064 5628. And 2532 whosoever will 2309 5723, let him take 2983 5720 the water 5204 of life 2222 freely 1432. 

22:18 For 1063 I testify 4828 5736 unto every man 3956 that heareth 191 5723 the words 3056 of the prophecy 4394 of this 5127 book 975, If 1437 any man 5100 shall add 2007 5725 unto 4314 these things 5023, God 2316 shall add 2007 5692 unto 1909 him 846 the plagues 4127 that are written 1125 5772 in 1722 this 5129 book 975: 

22:19 And 2532 if 1437 any man 5100 shall take away 851 5725 from 575 the words 3056 of the book 976 of this 5129 prophecy 4394, God 2316 shall take away 851 5692 his 846 part 3313 out of 575 the book 976 of life 2222, and 2532 out of 1537 the holy 40 city 4172, and 2532 [from] the things which are written 1125 5772 in 1722 this 5026 book 975. 

22:20 He which testifieth 3140 5723 these things 5023 saith 3004 5719, Surely 3483 I come 2064 5736 quickly 5035. Amen 281. Even so 3483, come 2064 5736, Lord 2962 Jesus 2424. 

22:21 The grace 5485 of our 2257 Lord 2962 Jesus 2424 Christ 5547 [be] with 3326 you 5216 all 3956. Amen 281.
