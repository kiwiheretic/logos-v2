1:1 The words 1697 of Jeremiah 3414 the son 1121 of Hilkiah, 2518 of the priests 3548 that [were] in Anathoth 6068 in the land 776 of Benjamin: 1144

1:2 To whom the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came in the days 3117 of Josiah 2977 the son 1121 of Amon 526 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 in the thirteenth 7969 6240 year 8141 of his reign. 4427-2

1:3 It came also in the days 3117 of Jehoiakim 3079 the son 1121 of Josiah 2977 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 unto the end 8552-2 of the eleventh 6249 6240 year 8141 of Zedekiah 6667 the son 1121 of Josiah 2977 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 unto the carrying away of Jerusalem 3389 captive 1540-2 in the fifth 2549 month. 2320

1:4 Then the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto me, saying, 559-2

1:5 Before 2962 I formed 3335-4 thee in the belly 990 I knew 3045-1 thee; and before 2962 thou camest forth 3318-4 out of the womb 7358 I sanctified 6942-52 thee, [and] I ordained 5414-1 thee a prophet 5030 unto the nations. 1471

1:6 Then said 559-4 I, Ah, 162 Lord 136 GOD! 3069 behold, I cannot 3808 3045-1 speak: 1696-15 for I [am] a child. 5288

1:7 But the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto me, Say 559-4 not, I [am] a child: 5288 for thou shalt go 3212-4 to all that I shall send 7971-4 thee, and whatsoever I command 6680-17 thee thou shalt speak. 1696-17

1:8 Be not afraid 3372-4 of their faces: 6440 for I [am] with thee to deliver 5337-53 thee, saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

1:9 Then the LORD 3068 put forth 7971-4 his hand, 3027 and touched 5060-55 my mouth. 6310 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto me, Behold, I have put 5414-1 my words 1697 in thy mouth. 6310

1:10 See, 7200-3 I have this day 3117 set 6485-52 thee over the nations 1471 and over the kingdoms, 4467 to root out, 5428-2 and to pull down, 5422-2 and to destroy, 6-53 and to throw down, 2040-2 to build, 1129-2 and to plant. 5193-2

1:11 Moreover the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto me, saying, 559-2 Jeremiah, 3414 what seest 7200-6 thou? And I said, 559-4 I see 7200-6 a rod 4731 of an almond tree. 8247

1:12 Then said 559-4 the LORD 3068 unto me, Thou hast well 3190-52 seen: 7200-2 for I will hasten 8245-6 my word 1697 to perform 6213-2 it.

1:13 And the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto me the second time, 8145 saying, 559-2 What seest 7200-6 thou? And I said, 559-4 I see 7200-6 a seething 5301-7 pot; 5518 and the face 6440 thereof [is] toward 6440 the north. 6828

1:14 Then the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto me, Out of the north 6828 an evil 7451 shall break forth 6605-11 upon all the inhabitants 3427-6 of the land. 776

1:15 For, lo, I will call 7121-6 all the families 4940 of the kingdoms 4467 of the north, 6828 saith 5002-7 the LORD; 3068 and they shall come, 935-1 and they shall set 5414-1 every one 376 his throne 3678 at the entering 6607 of the gates 8179 of Jerusalem, 3389 and against all the walls 2346 thereof round about, 5439 and against all the cities 5892 of Judah. 3063

1:16 And I will utter 1696-14 my judgments 4941 against them touching 5921 all their wickedness, 7451 who have forsaken 5800-1 me, and have burned incense 6999-17 unto other 312 gods, 430 and worshipped 7812-101 the works 4639 of their own hands. 3027

1:17 Thou therefore gird up 247-4 thy loins, 4975 and arise, 6965-1 and speak 1696-14 unto them all that I command 6680-17 thee: be not dismayed 2865-11 at their faces, 6440 lest I confound 2865-55 thee before 6440 them.

1:18 For, behold, I 589 have made 5414-1 thee this day 3117 a defenced 4013 city, 5892 and an iron 1270 pillar, 5982 and brasen 5178 walls 2346 against the whole land, 776 against the kings 4428 of Judah, 3063 against the princes 8269 thereof, against the priests 3548 thereof, and against the people 5971 of the land. 776

1:19 And they shall fight 3898-8 against thee; but they shall not prevail 3201-4 against thee; for I [am] with thee, saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 to deliver 5337-53 thee.

2:1 Moreover the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came to me, saying, 559-2

2:2 Go 1980-2 and cry 7121-1 in the ears 241 of Jerusalem, 3389 saying, 559-2 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 I remember 2142-1 thee, the kindness 2617 of thy youth, 5271 the love 160 of thine espousals, 3623 when thou wentest 3212-2 after 310 me in the wilderness, 4057 in a land 776 [that was] not sown. 2232-7

2:3 Israel 3478 [was] holiness 6944 unto the LORD, 3068 [and] the firstfruits 7225 of his increase: 8393 all that devour 398-6 him shall offend; 816-4 evil 7451 shall come 935-4 upon them, saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

2:4 Hear 8085-3 ye the word 1697 of the LORD, 3068 O house 1004 of Jacob, 3290 and all the families 4940 of the house 1004 of Israel: 3478

2:5 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 What iniquity 5766 have your fathers 1 found 4672-1 in me, that they are gone far 7368-1 from me, and have walked 3212-4 after 310 vanity, 1892 and are become vain? 1891-4

2:6 Neither said 559-1 they, Where [is] the LORD 3068 that brought us up 5927-56 out of the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 that led 3212-56 us through the wilderness, 4057 through a land 776 of deserts 6160 and of pits, 7745 through a land 776 of drought, 6723 and of the shadow of death, 6757 through a land 776 that no man 376 passed 5674-1 through, and where no man 120 dwelt? 3427-1

2:7 And I brought 935-55 you into a plentiful 3759 country, 776 to eat 398-2 the fruit 6529 thereof and the goodness 2898 thereof; but when ye entered, 935-4 ye defiled 2930-17 my land, 776 and made 7760-1 mine heritage 5159 an abomination. 8441

2:8 The priests 3548 said 559-1 not, Where [is] the LORD? 3068 and they that handle 8610-6 the law 8451 knew 3045-1 me not: the pastors 7462-6 also transgressed 6586-1 against me, and the prophets 5030 prophesied 5012-8 by Baal, 1168 and walked 1980-1 after 310 [things that] do not profit. 3276-55

2:9 Wherefore I will yet plead 7378-4 with you, saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 and with your children's 1121 children 1121 will I plead. 7378-4

2:10 For pass over 5674-3 the isles 339 of Chittim, 3794 and see; 7200-3 and send 7971-3 unto Kedar, 6938 and consider 995-112 diligently, 3966 and see 7200-3 if there be such a thing.

2:11 Hath a nation 1471 changed 3235-52 [their] gods, 430 which [are] yet no gods? 430 but my people 5971 have changed 4171-52 their glory 3519 for [that which] doth not profit. 3276-55

2:12 Be astonished, 8074-3 O ye heavens, 8064 at this, and be horribly afraid, 8175-3 be ye very 3966 desolate, 2717-3 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

2:13 For my people 5971 have committed 6213-1 two 8147 evils; 7451 they have forsaken 5800-1 me the fountain 4726 of living 2416 waters, 4325 [and] hewed them out 2672-2 cisterns, 877 broken 7665-12 cisterns, 877 that can hold 3557-55 no water. 4325

2:14 [Is] Israel 3478 a servant? 5650 [is] he a homeborn 1004 3211 [slave]? why 4069 is he spoiled? 957

2:15 The young lions 3715 roared 7580-4 upon him, [and] yelled, 5414-1 6963 and they made 7896-4 his land 776 waste: 8047 his cities 5892 are burned 3341-8 without inhabitant. 3427-6

2:16 Also the children 1121 of Noph 5297 and Tahapanes 8471 have broken 7462-4 the crown of thy head. 6936

2:17 Hast thou not procured 6213-4 this unto thyself, in that thou hast forsaken 5800-2 the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 when 6256 he led 3212-56 thee by the way? 1870

2:18 And now what hast thou to do in the way 1870 of Egypt, 4714 to drink 8354-2 the waters 4325 of Sihor? 7883 or what hast thou to do in the way 1870 of Assyria, 804 to drink 8354-2 the waters 4325 of the river? 5104

2:19 Thine own wickedness 7451 shall correct 3256-17 thee, and thy backslidings 4878 shall reprove 3198-55 thee: know 3045-3 therefore and see 7200-3 that [it is] an evil 7451 [thing] and bitter, 4751 that thou hast forsaken 5800-2 the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 and that my fear 6345 [is] not in thee, saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD 3069 of hosts. 6635

2:20 For of old 5769 time I have broken 7665-1 thy yoke, 5923 [and] burst 5423-14 thy bands; 4147 and thou saidst, 559-4 I will not transgress; 5674-4|5647-4-k when upon every high 1364 hill 1389 and under every green 7488 tree 6086 thou wanderest, 6808-6 playing the harlot. 2181-6

2:21 Yet I had planted 5193-1 thee a noble vine, 8321 wholly a right 571 seed: 2233 how then art thou turned 2015-8 into the degenerate 5494 plant of a strange 5237 vine 1612 unto me?

2:22 For though thou wash 3526-17 thee with nitre, 5427 and take thee much 7235-55 soap, 1287 [yet] thine iniquity 5771 is marked 3799-12 before 6440 me, saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

2:23 How canst thou say, 559-4 I am not polluted, 2930-8 I have not gone 1980-1 after 310 Baalim? 1168 see 7200-3 thy way 1870 in the valley, 1516 know 3045-3 what thou hast done: 6213-1 [thou art] a swift 7031 dromedary 1072 traversing 8308-18 her ways; 1870

2:24 A wild ass 6501 used 3928 to the wilderness, 4057 [that] snuffeth up 7602-1 the wind 7307 at her 5315 pleasure; 185 in her occasion 8385 who can turn her away? 7725-55 all they that seek 1245-18 her will not weary 3286-4 themselves; in her month 2320 they shall find 4672-4 her.

2:25 Withhold 4513-3 thy foot 7272 from being unshod, 3182 and thy throat 1627 from thirst: 6773 but thou saidst, 559-4 There is no hope: 2976-12 no; for I have loved 157-1 strangers, 2114-5 and after 310 them will I go. 3212-4

2:26 As the thief 1590 is ashamed 1322 when he is found, 4672-11 so is the house 1004 of Israel 3478 ashamed; 3001-52 they, their kings, 4428 their princes, 8269 and their priests, 3548 and their prophets, 5030

2:27 Saying 559-6 to a stock, 6086 Thou [art] my father; 1 and to a stone, 68 Thou hast brought me forth: 3205-1 for they have turned 6437-1 [their] back 6203 unto me, and not [their] face: 6440 but in the time 6256 of their trouble 7451 they will say, 559-4 Arise, 6965-3 and save 3467-54 us.

2:28 But where [are] thy gods 430 that thou hast made 6213-1 thee? let them arise, 6965-4 if they can save 3467-55 thee in the time 6256 of thy trouble: 7451 for [according to] the number 4557 of thy cities 5892 are thy gods, 430 O Judah. 3063

2:29 Wherefore will ye plead 7378-4 with me? ye all have transgressed 6586-1 against me, saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

2:30 In vain 7723 have I smitten 5221-52 your children; 1121 they received 3947-1 no correction: 4148 your own sword 2719 hath devoured 398-1 your prophets, 5030 like a destroying 7843-56 lion. 738

2:31 O generation, 1755 see 7200-3 ye the word 1697 of the LORD. 3068 Have I been a wilderness 4057 unto Israel? 3478 a land 776 of darkness? 3991 wherefore say 559-1 my people, 5971 We are lords; 7300-1 we will come 935-4 no more unto thee?

2:32 Can a maid 1330 forget 7911-4 her ornaments, 5716 [or] a bride 3618 her attire? 7196 yet my people 5971 have forgotten 7911-1 me days 3117 without number. 4557

2:33 Why trimmest 3190-55 thou thy way 1870 to seek 1245-15 love? 160 therefore hast thou also taught 3925-14 the wicked ones 7451 thy ways. 1870

2:34 Also in thy skirts 3671 is found 4672-8 the blood 1818 of the souls 5315 of the poor 34 innocents: 5355 I have not found 4672-1 it by secret search, 4290 but upon all these.

2:35 Yet thou sayest, 559-4 Because I am innocent, 5352-8 surely his anger 639 shall turn 7725-1 from me. Behold, I will plead 8199-12 with thee, because thou sayest, 559-2 I have not sinned. 2398-1

2:36 Why gaddest thou about 235-4 so much 3966 to change 8138-15 thy way? 1870 thou also shalt be ashamed 954-4 of Egypt, 4714 as thou wast ashamed 954-1 of Assyria. 804

2:37 Yea, thou shalt go forth 3318-4 from him, and thine hands 3027 upon thine head: 7218 for the LORD 3068 hath rejected 3988-1 thy confidences, 4009 and thou shalt not prosper 6743-55 in them.

3:1 They say, 559-2 If a man 376 put away 7971-17 his wife, 802 and she go 1980-1 from him, and become another 312 man's, 376 shall he return 7725-4 unto her again? shall not that land 776 be greatly 2610-2 polluted? 2610-4 but thou hast played the harlot 2181-1 with many 7227 lovers; 7453 yet return again 7725-2 to me, saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

3:2 Lift up 5375-3 thine eyes 5869 unto the high places, 8205 and see 7200-3 where 375 thou hast not been lien 7693-27|7901-27-q with. In the ways 1870 hast thou sat 3427-1 for them, as the Arabian 6163 in the wilderness; 4057 and thou hast polluted 2610-55 the land 776 with thy whoredoms 2184 and with thy wickedness. 7451

3:3 Therefore the showers 7241 have been withholden, 4513-11 and there hath been no latter rain; 4456 and thou hadst a whore's 2181-6 802 forehead, 4696 thou refusedst 3985-14 to be ashamed. 3637-9

3:4 Wilt thou not from this time cry 7121-1 unto me, My father, 1 thou [art] the guide 441 of my youth? 5271

3:5 Will he reserve 5201-4 [his anger] for ever? 5769 will he keep 8104-4 [it] to the end? 5331 Behold, thou hast spoken 1696-14 and done 6213-4 evil things 7451 as thou couldest. 3201-4

3:6 The LORD 3068 said 559-4 also unto me in the days 3117 of Josiah 2977 the king, 4428 Hast thou seen 7200-1 [that] which backsliding 4878 Israel 3478 hath done? 6213-1 she is gone up 1980-6 upon every high 1364 mountain 2022 and under 8478 every green 7488 tree, 6086 and there hath played the harlot. 2181-4

3:7 And I said 559-4 after 310 she had done 6213-2 all these [things], Turn 7725-4 thou unto me. But she returned 7725-1 not. And her treacherous 901 sister 269 Judah 3063 saw 7200-4 [it].

3:8 And I saw, 7200-4 when for all the causes 182 whereby backsliding 4878 Israel 3478 committed adultery 5003-14 I had put her away, 7971-14 and given 5414-4 her a bill 5612 of divorce; 3748 yet her treacherous 898-6 sister 269 Judah 3063 feared 3372-1 not, but went 3212-4 and played the harlot 2181-4 also.

3:9 And it came to pass through the lightness 6963 of her whoredom, 2184 that she defiled 2610-4 the land, 776 and committed adultery 5003-4 with stones 68 and with stocks. 6086

3:10 And yet for all this her treacherous 901 sister 269 Judah 3063 hath not turned 7725-1 unto me with her whole heart, 3820 but feignedly, 8267 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

3:11 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto me, The backsliding 4878 Israel 3478 hath justified 6663-14 herself 5315 more than treacherous 898-6 Judah. 3063

3:12 Go 1980-2 and proclaim 7121-1 these words 1697 toward the north, 6828 and say, 559-1 Return, 7725-3 thou backsliding 4878 Israel, 3478 saith 5002-7 the LORD; 3068 [and] I will not cause mine anger 6440 to fall 5307-55 upon you: for I [am] merciful, 2623 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 [and] I will not keep 5201-4 [anger] for ever. 5769

3:13 Only acknowledge 3045-3 thine iniquity, 5771 that thou hast transgressed 6586-1 against the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 and hast scattered 6340-17 thy ways 1870 to the strangers 2114-5 under every green 7488 tree, 6086 and ye have not obeyed 8085-1 my voice, 6963 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

3:14 Turn, 7725-3 O backsliding 7726 children, 1121 saith 5002-7 the LORD; 3068 for I am married 1166-1 unto you: and I will take 3947-1 you one 259 of a city, 5892 and two 8147 of a family, 4940 and I will bring 935-52 you to Zion: 6726

3:15 And I will give 5414-1 you pastors 7462-6 according to mine heart, 3820 which shall feed 7462-1 you with knowledge 1844 and understanding. 7919-53

3:16 And it shall come to pass, when ye be multiplied 7235-4 and increased 6509-1 in the land, 776 in those days, 3117 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 they shall say 559-4 no more, The ark 727 of the covenant 1285 of the LORD: 3068 neither shall it come 5927-4 to mind: 3820 neither shall they remember 2142-4 it; neither shall they visit 6485-4 [it]; neither shall [that] be done 6213-11 any more.

3:17 At that time 6256 they shall call 7121-4 Jerusalem 3389 the throne 3678 of the LORD; 3068 and all the nations 1471 shall be gathered 6960-8 unto it, to the name 8034 of the LORD, 3068 to Jerusalem: 3389 neither shall they walk 3212-4 any more after 310 the imagination 8307 of their evil 7451 heart. 3820

3:18 In those days 3117 the house 1004 of Judah 3063 shall walk 3212-4 with the house 1004 of Israel, 3478 and they shall come 935-4 together 3162 out of the land 776 of the north 6828 to the land 776 that I have given for an inheritance 5157-52 unto your fathers. 1

3:19 But I said, 559-1 How shall I put 7896-4 thee among the children, 1121 and give 5414-4 thee a pleasant 2532 land, 776 a goodly 6643 heritage 5159 of the hosts 6635 of nations? 1471 and I said, 559-4 Thou shalt call 7121-4 me, My father; 1 and shalt not turn away 7725-4 from 310 me.

3:20 Surely 403 [as] a wife 802 treacherously 898-1 departeth from her husband, 7453 so have ye dealt treacherously 898-1 with me, O house 1004 of Israel, 3478 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

3:21 A voice 6963 was heard 8085-8 upon the high places, 8205 weeping 1065 [and] supplications 8469 of the children 1121 of Israel: 3478 for they have perverted 5753-52 their way, 1870 [and] they have forgotten 7911-1 the LORD 3068 their God. 430

3:22 Return, 7725-3 ye backsliding 7726 children, 1121 [and] I will heal 7495-4 your backslidings. 4878 Behold, we come 857-1 unto thee; for thou [art] the LORD 3068 our God. 430

3:23 Truly 403 in vain 8267 [is salvation hoped for] from the hills, 1389 [and from] the multitude 1995 of mountains: 2022 truly 403 in the LORD 3068 our God 430 [is] the salvation 8668 of Israel. 3478

3:24 For shame 1322 hath devoured 398-1 the labour 3018 of our fathers 1 from our youth; 5271 their flocks 6629 and their herds, 1241 their sons 1121 and their daughters. 1323

3:25 We lie down 7901-4 in our shame, 1322 and our confusion 3639 covereth 3680-17 us: for we have sinned 2398-1 against the LORD 3068 our God, 430 we and our fathers, 1 from our youth 5271 even unto this day, 3117 and have not obeyed 8085-1 the voice 6963 of the LORD 3068 our God. 430

4:1 If thou wilt return, 7725-4 O Israel, 3478 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 return 7725-4 unto me: and if thou wilt put away 5493-55 thine abominations 8251 out of my sight, 6440 then shalt thou not remove. 5110-4

4:2 And thou shalt swear, 7650-8 The LORD 3068 liveth, 2416 in truth, 571 in judgment, 4941 and in righteousness; 6666 and the nations 1471 shall bless 1288-98 themselves in him, and in him shall they glory. 1984-101

4:3 For thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 to the men 376 of Judah 3063 and Jerusalem, 3389 Break up 5214-3 your fallow ground, 5215 and sow 2232-4 not among thorns. 6975

4:4 Circumcise 4135-10 yourselves to the LORD, 3068 and take away 5493-54 the foreskins 6190 of your heart, 3824 ye men 376 of Judah 3063 and inhabitants 3427-6 of Jerusalem: 3389 lest my fury 2534 come forth 3318-4 like fire, 784 and burn 1197-1 that none can quench 3518-18 [it], because 6440 of the evil 7455 of your doings. 4611

4:5 Declare 5046-54 ye in Judah, 3063 and publish 8085-54 in Jerusalem; 3389 and say, 559-3 Blow 8628-3 ye the trumpet 7782 in the land: 776 cry, 7121-3 gather together, 4390-16 and say, 559-3 Assemble 622-10 yourselves, and let us go 935-4 into the defenced 4013 cities. 5892

4:6 Set up 5375-3 the standard 5251 toward Zion: 6726 retire, 5756-54 stay 5975-4 not: for I will bring 935-56 evil 7451 from the north, 6828 and a great 1419 destruction. 7667

4:7 The lion 738 is come up 5927-1 from his thicket, 5441 and the destroyer 7843-56 of the Gentiles 1471 is on his way; 5265-1 he is gone forth 3318-1 from his place 4725 to make 7760-2 thy land 776 desolate; 8047 [and] thy cities 5892 shall be laid waste, 5327-4 without an inhabitant. 3427-6

4:8 For this gird 2296-3 you with sackcloth, 8242 lament 5594-3 and howl: 3213-54 for the fierce 2740 anger 639 of the LORD 3068 is not turned back 7725-1 from us.

4:9 And it shall come to pass at that day, 3117 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 [that] the heart 3820 of the king 4428 shall perish, 6-4 and the heart 3820 of the princes; 8269 and the priests 3548 shall be astonished, 8074-8 and the prophets 5030 shall wonder. 8539-4

4:10 Then said 559-4 I, Ah, 162 Lord 136 GOD! 3069 surely 403 thou hast greatly 5377-53 deceived 5377-52 this people 5971 and Jerusalem, 3389 saying, 559-2 Ye shall have peace; 7965 whereas the sword 2719 reacheth 5060-1 unto the soul. 5315

4:11 At that time 6256 shall it be said 559-11 to this people 5971 and to Jerusalem, 3389 A dry 6703 wind 7307 of the high places 8205 in the wilderness 4057 toward 1870 the daughter 1323 of my people, 5971 not to fan, 2219-2 nor to cleanse, 1305-53

4:12 [Even] a full 4392 wind 7307 from those [places] shall come 935-4 unto me: now also will I give 1696-17 sentence 4941 against them.

4:13 Behold, he shall come up 5927-4 as clouds, 6051 and his chariots 4818 [shall be] as a whirlwind: 5492 his horses 5483 are swifter 7043-1 than eagles. 5404 Woe 188 unto us! for we are spoiled. 7703-27

4:14 O Jerusalem, 3389 wash 3526-16 thine heart 3820 from wickedness, 7451 that thou mayest be saved. 3467-11 How long shall thy vain 205 thoughts 4284 lodge 3885-55 within 7130 thee?

4:15 For a voice 6963 declareth 5046-56 from Dan, 1835 and publisheth 8085-56 affliction 205 from mount 2022 Ephraim. 669

4:16 Make ye mention 2142-54 to the nations; 1471 behold, publish 8085-54 against Jerusalem, 3389 [that] watchers 5341-6 come 935-6 from a far 4801 country, 776 and give 5414-4 out their voice 6963 against the cities 5892 of Judah. 3063

4:17 As keepers 8104-6 of a field, 7704 are they against her round about; 5439 because she hath been rebellious 4784-1 against me, saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

4:18 Thy way 1870 and thy doings 4611 have procured 6213-1 these [things] unto thee; this [is] thy wickedness, 7451 because it is bitter, 4751 because it reacheth 5060-1 unto thine heart. 3820

4:19 My bowels, 4578 my bowels! 4578 I am pained 2342-4|3176-55-k at my very 7023 heart; 3820 my heart 3820 maketh a noise 1993-6 in me; I cannot hold my peace, 2790-55 because thou hast heard, 8085-1 O my soul, 5315 the sound 6963 of the trumpet, 7782 the alarm 8643 of war. 4421

4:20 Destruction 7667 upon destruction 7667 is cried; 7121-8 for the whole land 776 is spoiled: 7703-27 suddenly 6597 are my tents 168 spoiled, 7703-27 [and] my curtains 3407 in a moment. 7281

4:21 How long shall I see 7200-4 the standard, 5251 [and] hear 8085-4 the sound 6963 of the trumpet? 7782

4:22 For my people 5971 [is] foolish, 191 they have not known 3045-1 me; they [are] sottish 5530 children, 1121 and they have none understanding: 995-12 they [are] wise 2450 to do evil, 7489-53 but to do good 3190-53 they have no knowledge. 3045-1

4:23 I beheld 7200-1 the earth, 776 and, lo, [it was] without form, 8414 and void; 922 and the heavens, 8064 and they [had] no light. 216

4:24 I beheld 7200-1 the mountains, 2022 and, lo, they trembled, 7493-5 and all the hills 1389 moved lightly. 7043-115

4:25 I beheld, 7200-1 and, lo, [there was] no man, 120 and all the birds 5775 of the heavens 8064 were fled. 5074-1

4:26 I beheld, 7200-1 and, lo, the fruitful place 3760|3759 [was] a wilderness, 4057 and all the cities 5892 thereof were broken down 5422-8 at the presence 6440 of the LORD, 3068 [and] by 6440 his fierce 2740 anger. 639

4:27 For thus hath the LORD 3068 said, 559-1 The whole land 776 shall be desolate; 8077 yet will I not make 6213-4 a full end. 3617

4:28 For this shall the earth 776 mourn, 56-4 and the heavens 8064 above 4605 be black: 6937-1 because I have spoken 1696-14 [it], I have purposed 2161-1 [it], and will not repent, 5162-8 neither will I turn back 7725-4 from it.

4:29 The whole city 5892 shall flee 1272-6 for the noise 6963 of the horsemen 6571 and bowmen; 7198 7411-6 they shall go 935-1 into thickets, 5645 and climb up 5927-1 upon the rocks: 3710 every city 5892 [shall be] forsaken, 5800-7 and not a man 376 dwell 3427-6 therein. 2004

4:30 And [when] thou [art] spoiled, 7703-7 what wilt thou do? 6213-4 Though thou clothest 3847-4 thyself with crimson, 8144 though thou deckest 5710-4 thee with ornaments 5716 of gold, 2091 though thou rentest 7167-4 thy face 5869 with painting, 6320 in vain 7723 shalt thou make thyself fair; 3302-101 [thy] lovers 5689-6 will despise 3988-1 thee, they will seek 1245-17 thy life. 5315

4:31 For I have heard 8085-1 a voice 6963 as of a woman in travail, 2470-6 [and] the anguish 6869 as of her that bringeth forth her first child, 1069-56 the voice 6963 of the daughter 1323 of Zion, 6726 [that] bewaileth 3306-101 herself, [that] spreadeth 6566-17 her hands, 3709 [saying], Woe 188 [is] me now! for my soul 5315 is wearied 5888-1 because of murderers. 2026-6

5:1 Run ye to and fro 7751-33 through the streets 2351 of Jerusalem, 3389 and see 7200-3 now, and know, 3045-3 and seek 1245-16 in the broad places 7339 thereof, if ye can find 4672-4 a man, 376 if there be 3426 [any] that executeth 6213-6 judgment, 4941 that seeketh 1245-18 the truth; 530 and I will pardon 5545-4 it.

5:2 And though they say, 559-4 The LORD 3068 liveth; 2416 surely they swear 7650-11 falsely. 8267

5:3 O LORD, 3068 [are] not thine eyes 5869 upon the truth? 530 thou hast stricken 5221-52 them, but they have not grieved; 2342-1 thou hast consumed 3615-14 them, [but] they have refused 3985-14 to receive 3947-2 correction: 4148 they have made their faces 6440 harder 2388-14 than a rock; 5553 they have refused 3985-14 to return. 7725-2

5:4 Therefore I said, 559-1 Surely these [are] poor; 1800 they are foolish: 2973-8 for they know 3045-1 not the way 1870 of the LORD, 3068 [nor] the judgment 4941 of their God. 430

5:5 I will get 3212-4 me unto the great 1419 men, and will speak 1696-17 unto them; for they have known 3045-1 the way 1870 of the LORD, 3068 [and] the judgment 4941 of their God: 430 but these have altogether 3162 broken 7665-1 the yoke, 5923 [and] burst 5423-14 the bonds. 4147

5:6 Wherefore a lion 738 out of the forest 3293 shall slay 5221-52 them, [and] a wolf 2061 of the evenings 6160 shall spoil 7703-4 them, a leopard 5246 shall watch 8245-6 over their cities: 5892 every one that goeth out 3318-6 thence 2007 shall be torn in pieces: 2963-11 because their transgressions 6588 are many, 7231-1 [and] their backslidings 4878 are increased. 6105-1

5:7 How 335 shall I pardon 5545-4 thee for this? 2063 thy children 1121 have forsaken 5800-1 me, and sworn 7650-11 by [them that are] no 3808 gods: 430 when I had fed them to the full, 7650-55 they then committed adultery, 5003-4 and assembled 1413-108 themselves by troops in the harlots' 2181-6 houses. 1004

5:8 They were [as] fed 2109-94 horses 5483 in the morning: 7904-56 every one 376 neighed 6670-4 after his neighbour's 7453 wife. 802

5:9 Shall I not visit 6485-4 for these [things]? saith 5002-7 the LORD: 3068 and shall not my soul 5315 be avenged 5358-101 on such a nation 1471 as this?

5:10 Go ye up 5927-3 upon her walls, 8284 and destroy; 7843-16 but make 6213-4 not a full end: 3617 take away 5493-54 her battlements; 5189 for they [are] not the LORD'S. 3068

5:11 For the house 1004 of Israel 3478 and the house 1004 of Judah 3063 have dealt very 898-2 treacherously 898-1 against me, saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

5:12 They have belied 3584-14 the LORD, 3068 and said, 559-4 [It is] not he; neither shall evil 7451 come 935-4 upon us; neither shall we see 7200-4 sword 2719 nor famine: 7458

5:13 And the prophets 5030 shall become wind, 7307 and the word 1696-15 [is] not in them: thus shall it be done 6213-11 unto them.

5:14 Wherefore thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 God 430 of hosts, 6635 Because ye speak 1696-15 this word, 1697 behold, I will make 5414-6 my words 1697 in thy mouth 6310 fire, 784 and this people 5971 wood, 6086 and it shall devour 398-1 them.

5:15 Lo, I will bring 935-56 a nation 1471 upon you from far, 4801 O house 1004 of Israel, 3478 saith 5002-7 the LORD: 3068 it [is] a mighty 386 nation, 1471 it [is] an ancient 5769 nation, 1471 a nation 1471 whose language 3956 thou knowest 3045-4 not, neither understandest 8085-4 what they say. 1696-17

5:16 Their quiver 827 [is] as an open 6605-7 sepulchre, 6913 they [are] all mighty men. 1368

5:17 And they shall eat up 398-1 thine harvest, 7105 and thy bread, 3899 [which] thy sons 1121 and thy daughters 1323 should eat: 398-4 they shall eat up 398-4 thy flocks 6629 and thine herds: 1241 they shall eat up 398-4 thy vines 1612 and thy fig trees: 8384 they shall impoverish 7567-25 thy fenced 4013 cities, 5892 wherein 2007 thou trustedst, 982-6 with the sword. 2719

5:18 Nevertheless in those days, 3117 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 I will not make 6213-4 a full end 3617 with you.

5:19 And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, 559-4 Wherefore 8478 4100 doeth 6213-1 the LORD 3068 our God 430 all these [things] unto us? then shalt thou answer 559-1 them, Like as ye have forsaken 5800-1 me, and served 5647-4 strange 5236 gods 430 in your land, 776 so shall ye serve 5647-4 strangers 2114-5 in a land 776 [that is] not yours.

5:20 Declare 5046-54 this in the house 1004 of Jacob, 3290 and publish 8085-54 it in Judah, 3063 saying, 559-2

5:21 Hear 8085-3 now this, O foolish 5530 people, 5971 and without understanding; 3820 which have eyes, 5869 and see 7200-4 not; which have ears, 241 and hear 8085-4 not:

5:22 Fear 3372-4 ye not me? saith 5002-7 the LORD: 3068 will ye not tremble 2342-4 at my presence, 6440 which have placed 7760-1 the sand 2344 [for] the bound 1366 of the sea 3220 by a perpetual 5769 decree, 2706 that it cannot pass 5674-4 it: and though the waves 1530 thereof toss 1607-101 themselves, yet can they not prevail; 3201-4 though they roar, 1993-1 yet can they not pass over 5674-4 it?

5:23 But this people 5971 hath a revolting 5637-6 and a rebellious 4784-6 heart; 3820 they are revolted 5493-1 and gone. 3212-4

5:24 Neither say 559-1 they in their heart, 3824 Let us now fear 3372-4 the LORD 3068 our God, 430 that giveth 5414-6 rain, 1653 both the former 3138 and the latter, 4456 in his season: 6256 he reserveth 8104-4 unto us the appointed 2708 weeks 7620 of the harvest. 7105

5:25 Your iniquities 5771 have turned away 5186-52 these [things], and your sins 2403 have withholden 4513-1 good 2896 [things] from you.

5:26 For among my people 5971 are found 4672-8 wicked 7563 [men]: they lay wait, 7789-4 as he that setteth 7918-2 snares; 3353 they set 5324-52 a trap, 4889 they catch 3920-4 men. 582

5:27 As a cage 3619 is full 4392 of birds, 5775 so [are] their houses 1004 full 4392 of deceit: 4820 therefore they are become great, 1431-1 and waxen rich. 6238-55

5:28 They are waxen fat, 8080-1 they shine: 6245-1 yea, they overpass 5674-1 the deeds 1697 of the wicked: 7451 they judge 1777-1 not the cause, 1779 the cause 1779 of the fatherless, 3490 yet they prosper; 6743-55 and the right 4941 of the needy 34 do they not judge. 8199-1

5:29 Shall I not visit 6485-4 for these [things]? saith 5002-7 the LORD: 3068 shall not my soul 5315 be avenged 5358-101 on such a nation 1471 as this?

5:30 A wonderful 8047 and horrible thing 8186 is committed 1961-8 in the land; 776

5:31 The prophets 5030 prophesy 5012-8 falsely, 8267 and the priests 3548 bear rule 7287-4 by their means; 3027 and my people 5971 love 157-1 [to have it] so: and what will ye do 6213-4 in the end thereof? 319

6:1 O ye children 1121 of Benjamin, 1144 gather 5756-54 yourselves to flee out of the midst 7130 of Jerusalem, 3389 and blow 8628-3 the trumpet 7782 in Tekoa, 8620 and set up 5375-3 a sign of fire 4864 in Bethhaccerem: 1004|3754|1021 for evil 7451 appeareth 8259-8 out of the north, 6828 and great 1419 destruction. 7667

6:2 I have likened 1820-1 the daughter 1323 of Zion 6726 to a comely 5116 and delicate 6026-30 [woman].

6:3 The shepherds 7462-6 with their flocks 5739 shall come 935-4 unto her; they shall pitch 8628-1 [their] tents 168 against her round about; 5439 they shall feed 7462-1 every one 376 in his place. 3027

6:4 Prepare 6942-16 ye war 4421 against her; arise, 6965-3 and let us go up 5927-4 at noon. 6672 Woe 188 unto us! for the day 3117 goeth away, 6437-1 for the shadows 6752 of the evening 6153 are stretched out. 5186-11

6:5 Arise, 6965-3 and let us go 5927-4 by night, 3915 and let us destroy 7843-55 her palaces. 759

6:6 For thus hath the LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 said, 559-1 Hew ye down 3772-3 trees, 6097 and cast 8210-3 a mount 5550 against Jerusalem: 3389 this [is] the city 5892 to be visited; 6485-90 she [is] wholly oppression 6233 in the midst 7130 of her.

6:7 As a fountain 953 casteth out 6979-53 her waters, 4325 so she casteth out 6979-52 her wickedness: 7451 violence 2555 and spoil 7701 is heard 8085-11 in her; before 6440 me continually 8548 [is] grief 2483 and wounds. 4347

6:8 Be thou instructed, 3256-10 O Jerusalem, 3389 lest my soul 5315 depart 3363-4 from thee; lest I make 7760-4 thee desolate, 8077 a land 776 not inhabited. 3427-8

6:9 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 They shall throughly 5953-23 glean 5953-25 the remnant 7611 of Israel 3478 as a vine: 1612 turn back 7725-54 thine hand 3027 as a grapegatherer 1219-6 into the baskets. 5552

6:10 To whom shall I speak, 1696-17 and give warning, 5749-55 that they may hear? 8085-4 behold, their ear 241 [is] uncircumcised, 6189 and they cannot 3808 3201-4 hearken: 7181-53 behold, the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 is unto them a reproach; 2781 they have no delight 2654-4 in it.

6:11 Therefore I am full 4390-1 of the fury 2534 of the LORD; 3068 I am weary 3811-8 with holding in: 3557-53 I will pour it out 8210-2 upon the children 5768 abroad, 2351 and upon the assembly 5475 of young men 970 together: 3162 for even the husband 376 with the wife 802 shall be taken, 3920-11 the aged 2205 with [him that is] full 4392 of days. 3117

6:12 And their houses 1004 shall be turned 5437-8 unto others, 312 [with their] fields 7704 and wives 802 together: 3162 for I will stretch out 5186-55 my hand 3027 upon the inhabitants 3427-6 of the land, 776 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

6:13 For from the least 6996 of them even unto the greatest 1419 of them every one [is] given 1214-6 to covetousness; 1215 and from the prophet 5030 even unto the priest 3548 every one dealeth 6213-6 falsely. 8267

6:14 They have healed 7495-17 also the hurt 7667 [of the daughter] 1323 of my people 5971 slightly, 7043-8 saying, 559-2 Peace, 7965 peace; 7965 when [there is] no peace. 7965

6:15 Were they ashamed 3001-52 when they had committed 6213-1 abomination? 8441 nay, 1571 they were not at all 954-2 ashamed, 954-4 neither 1571 could 3045-1 they blush: 3637-53 therefore they shall fall 5307-4 among them that fall: 5307-6 at the time 6256 [that] I visit 6485-1 them they shall be cast down, 3782-11 saith 559-1 the LORD. 3068

6:16 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Stand 5975-3 ye in the ways, 1870 and see, 7200-3 and ask 7592-3 for the old 5769 paths, 5410 where [is] the good 2896 way, 1870 and walk 3212-3 therein, and ye shall find 4672-3 rest 4771 for your souls. 5315 But they said, 559-4 We will not walk 3212-4 [therein].

6:17 Also I set 6965-52 watchmen 6822-6 over you, [saying], Hearken 7181-54 to the sound 6963 of the trumpet. 7782 But they said, 559-4 We will not hearken. 7181-55

6:18 Therefore hear, 8085-3 ye nations, 1471 and know, 3045-3 O congregation, 5712 what [is] among them.

6:19 Hear, 8085-3 O earth: 776 behold, I will bring 935-56 evil 7451 upon this people, 5971 [even] the fruit 6529 of their thoughts, 4284 because they have not hearkened 7181-52 unto my words, 1697 nor to my law, 8451 but rejected 3988-4 it.

6:20 To what purpose cometh 935-4 there to me incense 3828 from Sheba, 7614 and the sweet 2896 cane 7070 from a far 4801 country? 776 your burnt offerings 5930 [are] not acceptable, 7522 nor your sacrifices 2077 sweet 6149-1 unto me.

6:21 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Behold, I will lay 5414-6 stumblingblocks 4383 before this people, 5971 and the fathers 1 and the sons 1121 together 3162 shall fall 3782-1 upon them; the neighbour 7934 and his friend 7453 shall perish. 6-1

6:22 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Behold, a people 5971 cometh 935-6 from the north 6828 country, 776 and a great 1419 nation 1471 shall be raised 5782-11 from the sides 3411 of the earth. 776

6:23 They shall lay hold 2388-55 on bow 7198 and spear; 3591 they [are] cruel, 394 and have no mercy; 7355-17 their voice 6963 roareth 1993-4 like the sea; 3220 and they ride 7392-4 upon horses, 5483 set in array 6186-7 as men 376 for war 4421 against thee, O daughter 1323 of Zion. 6726

6:24 We have heard 8085-1 the fame 8089 thereof: our hands 3027 wax feeble: 7503-1 anguish 6869 hath taken hold 2388-52 of us, [and] pain, 2427 as of a woman in travail. 3205-6

6:25 Go not forth 3318-4 into the field, 7704 nor walk 3212-4 by the way; 1870 for the sword 2719 of the enemy 341-6 [and] fear 4032 [is] on every side. 5439

6:26 O daughter 1323 of my people, 5971 gird 2296-3 [thee] with sackcloth, 8242 and wallow 6428-100 thyself in ashes: 665 make 6213-3 thee mourning, 60 [as for] an only son, 3173 most bitter 8563 lamentation: 4553 for the spoiler 7703-6 shall suddenly 6597 come 935-4 upon us.

6:27 I have set 5414-1 thee [for] a tower 969 [and] a fortress 4013 among my people, 5971 that thou mayest know 3045-4 and try 974-1 their way. 1870

6:28 They [are] all grievous 5493-6 revolters, 5637-6 walking 1980-6 with slanders: 7400 [they are] brass 5178 and iron; 1270 they [are] all corrupters. 7843-56

6:29 The bellows 4647 are burned, 2787-8 the lead 5777 is consumed 8552-1 of the fire; 800 784 the founder 6884-2 melteth 6884-1 in vain: 7723 for the wicked 7451 are not plucked away. 5423-8

6:30 Reprobate 3988-12 silver 3701 shall [men] call 7121-1 them, because the LORD 3068 hath rejected 3988-1 them.

7:1 The word 1697 that came to Jeremiah 3414 from the LORD, 3068 saying, 559-2

7:2 Stand 5975-3 in the gate 8179 of the LORD'S 3068 house, 1004 and proclaim 7121-1 there this word, 1697 and say, 559-1 Hear 8085-3 the word 1697 of the LORD, 3068 all [ye of] Judah, 3063 that enter in 935-6 at these gates 8179 to worship 7812-99 the LORD. 3068

7:3 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 the God 430 of Israel, 3478 Amend 3190-54 your ways 1870 and your doings, 4611 and I will cause you to dwell 7931-17 in this place. 4725

7:4 Trust 982-4 ye not in lying 8267 words, 1697 saying, 559-2 The temple 1964 of the LORD, 3068 The temple 1964 of the LORD, 3068 The temple 1964 of the LORD, 3068 [are] these.

7:5 For if ye throughly 3190-53 amend 3190-55 your ways 1870 and your doings; 4611 if ye throughly 6213-2 execute 6213-4 judgment 4941 between a man 376 and his neighbour; 7453

7:6 [If] ye oppress 6231-4 not the stranger, 1616 the fatherless, 3490 and the widow, 490 and shed 8210-4 not innocent 5355 blood 1818 in this place, 4725 neither walk 3212-4 after 310 other 312 gods 430 to your hurt: 7451

7:7 Then will I cause you to dwell 7931-14 in this place, 4725 in the land 776 that I gave 5414-1 to your fathers, 1 for 5704 ever 5769 and ever. 5769

7:8 Behold, ye trust 982-6 in lying 8267 words, 1697 that cannot profit. 3276-53

7:9 Will ye steal, 1589-2 murder, 7523-2 and commit adultery, 5003-2 and swear 7650-9 falsely, 8267 and burn incense 6999-15 unto Baal, 1168 and walk 1980-2 after 310 other 312 gods 430 whom ye know 3045-1 not;

7:10 And come 935-1 and stand 5975-1 before 6440 me in this house, 1004 which is called 7121-8 by my name, 8034 and say, 559-1 We are delivered 5337-8 to do 6213-2 all these abominations? 8441

7:11 Is this house, 1004 which is called 7121-8 by my name, 8034 become a den 4631 of robbers 6530 in your eyes? 5869 Behold, even I have seen 7200-1 [it], saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

7:12 But go 3212-3 ye now unto my place 4725 which [was] in Shiloh, 7887 where I set 7931-14 my name 8034 at the first, 7223 and see 7200-3 what I did 6213-1 to it for 6440 the wickedness 7451 of my people 5971 Israel. 3478

7:13 And now, because ye have done 6213-2 all these works, 4639 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 and I spake 1696-17 unto you, rising up early 7925-53 and speaking, 1696-15 but ye heard 8085-1 not; and I called 7121-4 you, but ye answered 6030-1 not;

7:14 Therefore will I do 6213-1 unto [this] house, 1004 which is called 7121-8 by my name, 8034 wherein ye trust, 982-6 and unto the place 4725 which I gave 5414-1 to you and to your fathers, 1 as I have done 6213-1 to Shiloh. 7887

7:15 And I will cast 7993-52 you out of my sight, 6440 as I have cast 7993-52 out all your brethren, 251 [even] the whole seed 2233 of Ephraim. 669

7:16 Therefore pray 6419-101 not thou for this people, 5971 neither lift up 5375-4 cry 7440 nor prayer 8605 for them, 1157 neither make intercession 6293-4 to me: for I will not hear 8085-6 thee.

7:17 Seest 7200-6 thou not what they do 6213-6 in the cities 5892 of Judah 3063 and in the streets 2351 of Jerusalem? 3389

7:18 The children 1121 gather 3950-18 wood, 6086 and the fathers 1 kindle 1197-18 the fire, 784 and the women 802 knead 3888-6 [their] dough, 1217 to make 6213-2 cakes 3561 to the queen 4446 of heaven, 8064 and to pour out 5258-53 drink offerings 5262 unto other 312 gods, 430 that they may provoke me to anger. 3707-53

7:19 Do they provoke me to anger? 3707-56 saith 5002-7 the LORD: 3068 [do they] not [provoke] themselves to the confusion 1322 of their own faces? 6440

7:20 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Behold, mine anger 639 and my fury 2534 shall be poured out 5413-12 upon this place, 4725 upon man, 120 and upon beast, 929 and upon the trees 6086 of the field, 7704 and upon the fruit 6529 of the ground; 127 and it shall burn, 1197-1 and shall not be quenched. 3518-4

7:21 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 the God 430 of Israel; 3478 Put 5595-3 your burnt offerings 5930 unto your sacrifices, 2077 and eat 398-3 flesh. 1320

7:22 For I spake 1696-14 not unto your fathers, 1 nor commanded 6680-14 them in the day 3117 that I brought them out 3318-53 of the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 concerning 1697 burnt offerings 5930 or sacrifices: 2077

7:23 But this thing 1697 commanded 6680-14 I them, saying, 559-2 Obey 8085-3 my voice, 6963 and I will be your God, 430 and ye shall be my people: 5971 and walk 1980-1 ye in all the ways 1870 that I have commanded 6680-17 you, that it may be well 3190-4 unto you.

7:24 But they hearkened 8085-1 not, nor inclined 5186-52 their ear, 241 but walked 3212-4 in the counsels 4156 [and] in the imagination 8307 of their evil 7451 heart, 3820 and went backward, 268 and not forward. 6440

7:25 Since the day 3117 that your fathers 1 came forth 3318-1 out of the land 776 of Egypt 4714 unto this day 3117 I have even sent 7971-4 unto you all my servants 5650 the prophets, 5030 daily 3117 rising up early 7925-53 and sending 7971-2 [them]:

7:26 Yet they hearkened 8085-1 not unto me, nor inclined 5186-52 their ear, 241 but hardened 7185-55 their neck: 6203 they did worse 7489-52 than their fathers. 1

7:27 Therefore thou shalt speak 1696-14 all these words 1697 unto them; but they will not hearken 8085-4 to thee: thou shalt also call 7121-1 unto them; but they will not answer 6030-4 thee.

7:28 But thou shalt say 559-1 unto them, This [is] a nation 1471 that obeyeth 8085-1 not the voice 6963 of the LORD 3068 their God, 430 nor receiveth 3947-1 correction: 4148 truth 530 is perished, 6-1 and is cut off 3772-8 from their mouth. 6310

7:29 Cut off 1494-3 thine hair, 5145 [O Jerusalem], and cast [it] away, 7993-54 and take up 5375-3 a lamentation 7015 on high places; 8205 for the LORD 3068 hath rejected 3988-1 and forsaken 5203-4 the generation 1755 of his wrath. 5678

7:30 For the children 1121 of Judah 3063 have done 6213-1 evil 7451 in my sight, 5869 saith 5002-7 the LORD: 3068 they have set 7760-1 their abominations 8251 in the house 1004 which is called 7121-8 by my name, 8034 to pollute 2930-15 it.

7:31 And they have built 1129-1 the high places 1116 of Tophet, 8612 which [is] in the valley 1516 of the son 1121 of Hinnom, 2011 to burn 8313-2 their sons 1121 and their daughters 1323 in the fire; 784 which I commanded 6680-14 [them] not, neither came 5927-1 it into my heart. 3820

7:32 Therefore, behold, the days 3117 come, 935-6 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 that it shall no more be called 559-11 Tophet, 8612 nor the valley 1516 of the son 1121 of Hinnom, 2011 but the valley 1516 of slaughter: 2028 for they shall bury 6912-1 in Tophet, 8612 till there be no 369 place. 4725

7:33 And the carcases 5038 of this people 5971 shall be meat 3978 for the fowls 5775 of the heaven, 8064 and for the beasts 929 of the earth; 776 and none shall fray [them] away. 2729-56

7:34 Then will I cause to cease 7673-52 from the cities 5892 of Judah, 3063 and from the streets 2351 of Jerusalem, 3389 the voice 6963 of mirth, 8342 and the voice 6963 of gladness, 8057 the voice 6963 of the bridegroom, 2860 and the voice 6963 of the bride: 3618 for the land 776 shall be desolate. 2723

8:1 At that time, 6256 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 they shall bring out 3318-55 the bones 6106 of the kings 4428 of Judah, 3063 and the bones 6106 of his princes, 8269 and the bones 6106 of the priests, 3548 and the bones 6106 of the prophets, 5030 and the bones 6106 of the inhabitants 3427-6 of Jerusalem, 3389 out of their graves: 6913

8:2 And they shall spread 7849-1 them before the sun, 8121 and the moon, 3394 and all the host 6635 of heaven, 8064 whom they have loved, 157-1 and whom they have served, 5647-1 and after 310 whom they have walked, 1980-1 and whom they have sought, 1875-1 and whom they have worshipped: 7812-98 they shall not be gathered, 622-11 nor be buried; 6912-11 they shall be for dung 1828 upon the face 6440 of the earth. 127

8:3 And death 4194 shall be chosen 977-8 rather than life 2416 by all the residue 7611 of them that remain 7604-12 of this evil 7451 family, 4940 which remain 7604-12 in all the places 4725 whither I have driven 5080-52 them, saith 5002-7 the LORD 3068 of hosts. 6635

8:4 Moreover thou shalt say 559-1 unto them, Thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 Shall they fall, 5307-4 and not arise? 6965-4 shall he turn away, 7725-4 and not return? 7725-4

8:5 Why [then] is this people 5971 of Jerusalem 3389 slidden back 7725-31 by a perpetual 5329-12 backsliding? 4878 they hold 2388-52 fast deceit, 8649 they refuse 3985-14 to return. 7725-2

8:6 I hearkened 7181-52 and heard, 8085-4 [but] they spake 1696-17 not aright: 3808 no man 376 repented 5162-12 him of 5921 his wickedness, 7451 saying, 559-2 What have I done? 6213-1 every one turned 7725-1 to his course, 4794 as the horse 5483 rusheth 7857-6 into the battle. 4421

8:7 Yea, the stork 2624 in the heaven 8064 knoweth 3045-1 her appointed times; 4150 and the turtle 8449 and the crane 5483 and the swallow 5693 observe 8104-1 the time 6256 of their coming; 935-2 but my people 5971 know 3045-1 not the judgment 4941 of the LORD. 3068

8:8 How do ye say, 559-4 We [are] wise, 2450 and the law 8451 of the LORD 3068 [is] with us? Lo, certainly 403 in vain 8267 made 6213-1 he [it]; the pen 5842 of the scribes 5608-6 [is] in vain. 8267

8:9 The wise 2450 [men] are ashamed, 3001-52 they are dismayed 2865-1 and taken: 3920-11 lo, they have rejected 3988-1 the word 1697 of the LORD; 3068 and what wisdom 2451 [is] in them?

8:10 Therefore will I give 5414-4 their wives 802 unto others, 312 [and] their fields 7704 to them that shall inherit 3423-6 [them]: for every one from the least 6996 even unto the greatest 1419 is given 1214-6 to covetousness, 1215 from the prophet 5030 even unto the priest 3548 every one dealeth 6213-6 falsely. 8267

8:11 For they have healed 7495-17 the hurt 7667 of the daughter 1323 of my people 5971 slightly, 7043-8 saying, 559-2 Peace, 7965 peace; 7965 when [there is] no peace. 7965

8:12 Were they ashamed 3001-52 when they had committed 6213-1 abomination? 8441 nay, they were not at all 954-2 ashamed, 954-4 neither could 3045-1 they blush: 3637-9 therefore shall they fall 5307-4 among them that fall: 5307-6 in the time 6256 of their visitation 6486 they shall be cast down, 3782-11 saith 559-1 the LORD. 3068

8:13 I will surely 622-2 consume 5486-55 them, saith 5002-7 the LORD: 3068 [there shall be] no grapes 6025 on the vine, 1612 nor figs 8384 on the fig tree, 8384 and the leaf 5929 shall fade; 5034-1 and [the things that] I have given 5414-4 them shall pass away 5674-4 from them.

8:14 Why do we sit still? 3427-6 assemble 622-10 yourselves, and let us enter 935-4 into the defenced 4013 cities, 5892 and let us be silent 1826-11 there: for the LORD 3068 our God 430 hath put us to silence, 1826-52 and given us water 4325 of gall 7219 to drink, 8248-55 because we have sinned 2398-1 against the LORD. 3068

8:15 We looked 6960-15 for peace, 7965 but no good 2896 [came; and] for a time 6256 of health, 4832 and behold trouble! 1205

8:16 The snorting 5170 of his horses 5483 was heard 8085-8 from Dan: 1835 the whole land 776 trembled 7493-1 at the sound 6963 of the neighing 4684 of his strong ones; 47 for they are come, 935-4 and have devoured 398-4 the land, 776 and all that is in it; 4393 the city, 5892 and those that dwell 3427-6 therein.

8:17 For, behold, I will send 7971-18 serpents, 5175 cockatrices, 6848 among you, which [will] not [be] charmed, 3908 and they shall bite 5391-14 you, saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

8:18 [When] I would comfort 4010 myself against sorrow, 3015 my heart 3820 [is] faint 1742 in me.

8:19 Behold the voice 6963 of the cry 7775 of the daughter 1323 of my people 5971 because of them that dwell in a far 4801 country: 776 [Is] not the LORD 3068 in Zion? 6726 [is] not her king 4428 in her? Why have they provoked me to anger 3707-52 with their graven images, 6456 [and] with strange 5236 vanities? 1892

8:20 The harvest 7105 is past, 5674-1 the summer 7019 is ended, 3615-1 and we are not saved. 3467-8

8:21 For the hurt 7667 of the daughter 1323 of my people 5971 am I hurt; 7665-90 I am black; 6937-1 astonishment 8047 hath taken hold 2388-52 on me.

8:22 [Is there] no balm 6875 in Gilead; 1568 [is there] no physician 7495-6 there? why then 3588 is not the health 724 of the daughter 1323 of my people 5971 recovered? 5927-1

9:1 Oh that 5414-4 my head 7218 were waters, 4325 and mine eyes 5869 a fountain 4726 of tears, 1832 that I might weep 1058-4 day 3119 and night 3915 for the slain 2491 of the daughter 1323 of my people! 5971

9:2 Oh that 5414-4 I had in the wilderness 4057 a lodging place 4411 of wayfaring men; 732-6 that I might leave 5800-4 my people, 5971 and go 3212-4 from them! for they [be] all adulterers, 5003-18 an assembly 6116 of treacherous men. 898-6

9:3 And they bend 1869-55 their tongues 3956 [like] their bow 7198 [for] lies: 8267 but they are not valiant 1396-1 for the truth 530 upon the earth; 776 for they proceed 3318-1 from evil 7451 to evil, 7451 and they know 3045-1 not me, saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

9:4 Take ye heed 8104-10 every one 376 of his neighbour, 7453 and trust 982-4 ye not in any brother: 251 for every brother 251 will utterly 6117-2 supplant, 6117-4 and every neighbour 7453 will walk 1980-4 with slanders. 7400

9:5 And they will deceive 2048-17 every one 376 his neighbour, 7453 and will not speak 1696-17 the truth: 571 they have taught 3925-14 their tongue 3956 to speak 1696-15 lies, 8267 [and] weary 3811-8 themselves to commit iniquity. 5753-53

9:6 Thine habitation 3427-2 [is] in the midst 8432 of deceit; 4820 through deceit 4820 they refuse 3985-14 to know 3045-2 me, saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

9:7 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 Behold, I will melt 6884-6 them, and try 974-1 them; for how shall I do 6213-4 for 6440 the daughter 1323 of my people? 5971

9:8 Their tongue 3956 [is as] an arrow 2671 shot out; 7819-7 it speaketh 1696-14 deceit: 4820 [one] speaketh 1696-17 peaceably 7965 to his neighbour 7453 with his mouth, 6310 but in heart 7130 he layeth 7760-4 his wait. 696

9:9 Shall I not visit 6485-4 them for these [things]? saith 5002-7 the LORD: 3068 shall not my soul 5315 be avenged 5358-101 on such a nation 1471 as this?

9:10 For the mountains 2022 will I take up 5375-4 a weeping 1065 and wailing, 5092 and for the habitations 4999 of the wilderness 4057 a lamentation, 7015 because they are burned up, 3341-8 so that none 376 can pass through 5674-6 [them]; neither can [men] hear 8085-1 the voice 6963 of the cattle; 4735 both the fowl 5775 of the heavens 8064 and the beast 929 are fled; 5074-1 they are gone. 1980-1

9:11 And I will make 5414-1 Jerusalem 3389 heaps, 1530 [and] a den 4583 of dragons; 8577 and I will make 5414-4 the cities 5892 of Judah 3063 desolate, 8077 without an inhabitant. 3427-6

9:12 Who [is] the wise 2450 man, 376 that may understand 995-4 this? and [who is he] to whom the mouth 6310 of the LORD 3068 hath spoken, 1696-14 that he may declare 5046-55 it, for what the land 776 perisheth 6-1 [and] is burned up 3341-8 like a wilderness, 4057 that none passeth through? 5674-6

9:13 And the LORD 3068 saith, 559-4 Because they have forsaken 5800-2 my law 8451 which I set 5414-1 before 6440 them, and have not obeyed 8085-1 my voice, 6963 neither walked 1980-1 therein;

9:14 But have walked 3212-4 after 310 the imagination 8307 of their own heart, 3820 and after 310 Baalim, 1168 which their fathers 1 taught 3925-14 them:

9:15 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 the God 430 of Israel; 3478 Behold, I will feed 398-56 them, [even] this people, 5971 with wormwood, 3939 and give them water 4325 of gall 7219 to drink. 8248-52

9:16 I will scatter 6327-52 them also among the heathen, 1471 whom neither they nor their fathers 1 have known: 3045-1 and I will send 7971-14 a sword 2719 after 310 them, till I have consumed 3615-15 them.

9:17 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 Consider 995-112 ye, and call 7121-3 for the mourning 6969-35 women, that they may come; 935-4 and send 7971-3 for cunning 2450 [women], that they may come: 935-4

9:18 And let them make haste, 4116-17 and take up 5375-4 a wailing 5092 for us, that our eyes 5869 may run down 3381-4 with tears, 1832 and our eyelids 6079 gush out 5140-4 with waters. 4325

9:19 For a voice 6963 of wailing 5092 is heard 8085-8 out of Zion, 6726 How are we spoiled! 7703-27 we are greatly 3966 confounded, 954-1 because we have forsaken 5800-1 the land, 776 because our dwellings 4908 have cast [us] out. 7993-52

9:20 Yet hear 8085-3 the word 1697 of the LORD, 3068 O ye women, 802 and let your ear 241 receive 3947-4 the word 1697 of his mouth, 6310 and teach 3925-16 your daughters 1323 wailing, 5092 and every one 802 her neighbour 7468 lamentation. 7015

9:21 For death 4194 is come up 5927-1 into our windows, 2474 [and] is entered 935-1 into our palaces, 759 to cut off 3772-53 the children 5768 from without, 2351 [and] the young men 970 from the streets. 7339

9:22 Speak, 1696-16 Thus saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 Even the carcases 5038 of men 120 shall fall 5307-1 as dung 1828 upon the open 6440 field, 7704 and as the handful 5995 after 310 the harvestman, 7114-6 and none shall gather 622-18 [them].

9:23 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Let not the wise 2450 [man] glory 1984-101 in his wisdom, 2451 neither let the mighty 1368 [man] glory 1984-101 in his might, 1369 let not the rich 6223 [man] glory 1984-101 in his riches: 6239

9:24 But let him that glorieth 1984-102 glory 1984-101 in this, that he understandeth 7919-53 and knoweth 3045-2 me, that I [am] the LORD 3068 which exercise 6213-6 lovingkindness, 2617 judgment, 4941 and righteousness, 6666 in the earth: 776 for in these [things] I delight, 2654-1 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

9:25 Behold, the days 3117 come, 935-6 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 that I will punish 6485-1 all [them which are] circumcised 4135-7 with the uncircumcised; 6190

9:26 Egypt, 4714 and Judah, 3063 and Edom, 123 and the children 1121 of Ammon, 5983 and Moab, 4124 and all [that are] in the utmost 7112-7 corners, 6285 that dwell 3427-6 in the wilderness: 4057 for all [these] nations 1471 [are] uncircumcised, 6189 and all the house 1004 of Israel 3478 [are] uncircumcised 6189 in the heart. 3820

10:1 Hear 8085-3 ye the word 1697 which the LORD 3068 speaketh 1696-14 unto you, O house 1004 of Israel: 3478

10:2 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Learn 3925-4 not the way 1870 of the heathen, 1471 and be not dismayed 2865-11 at the signs 226 of heaven; 8064 for the heathen 1471 are dismayed 2865-11 at them. 1992

10:3 For the customs 2708 of the people 5971 [are] vain: 1892 for [one] cutteth 3772-1 a tree 6086 out of the forest, 3293 the work 4639 of the hands 3027 of the workman, 2796 with the axe. 4621

10:4 They deck 3302-17 it with silver 3701 and with gold; 2091 they fasten 2388-17 it with nails 4548 and with hammers, 4717 that it move 6328-55 not.

10:5 They [are] upright 4749 as the palm tree, 8560 but speak 1696-17 not: they must needs 5375-2 be borne, 5375-11 because they cannot go. 6805-4 Be not afraid 3372-4 of them; for they cannot do evil, 7489-55 neither also [is it] in them to do good. 3190-53

10:6 Forasmuch as [there is] none like unto thee, O LORD; 3068 thou [art] great, 1419 and thy name 8034 [is] great 1419 in might. 1369

10:7 Who would not fear 3372-4 thee, O King 4428 of nations? 1471 for to thee doth it appertain: 2969-1 forasmuch as among all the wise 2450 [men] of the nations, 1471 and in all their kingdoms, 4438 [there is] none like unto thee.

10:8 But they are altogether 259 brutish 1197-4 and foolish: 3688-4 the stock 6086 [is] a doctrine 4148 of vanities. 1892

10:9 Silver 3701 spread into plates 7554-30 is brought 935-93 from Tarshish, 8659 and gold 2091 from Uphaz, 210 the work 4639 of the workman, 2796 and of the hands 3027 of the founder: 6884-6 blue 8504 and purple 713 [is] their clothing: 3830 they [are] all the work 4639 of cunning 2450 [men].

10:10 But the LORD 3068 [is] the true 571 God, 430 he [is] the living 2416 God, 430 and an everlasting 5769 king: 4428 at his wrath 7110 the earth 776 shall tremble, 7493-4 and the nations 1471 shall not be able to abide 3557-55 his indignation. 2195

10:11 Thus 1836 shall ye say 560-60 unto them, The gods 426 that have not 3809 made 5648-57 the heavens 8065 and the earth, 778 [even] they shall perish 7-60 from the earth, 772 and from under 8460 these 429 heavens. 8065

10:12 He hath made 6213-6 the earth 776 by his power, 3581 he hath established 3559-56 the world 8398 by his wisdom, 2451 and hath stretched out 5186-1 the heavens 8064 by his discretion. 8394

10:13 When he uttereth 5414-2 his voice, 6963 [there is] a multitude 1995 of waters 4325 in the heavens, 8064 and he causeth the vapours 5387 to ascend 5927-55 from the ends 7097 of the earth; 776 he maketh 6213-1 lightnings 1300 with rain, 4306 and bringeth forth 3318-55 the wind 7307 out of his treasures. 214

10:14 Every man 120 is brutish 1197-8 in [his] knowledge: 1847 every founder 6884-6 is confounded 3001-52 by the graven image: 6459 for his molten image 5262 [is] falsehood, 8267 and [there is] no breath 7307 in them.

10:15 They [are] vanity, 1892 [and] the work 4639 of errors: 8595 in the time 6256 of their visitation 6486 they shall perish. 6-4

10:16 The portion 2506 of Jacob 3290 [is] not like them: for he [is] the former 3335-6 of all [things]; and Israel 3478 [is] the rod 7626 of his inheritance: 5159 The LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 [is] his name. 8034

10:17 Gather 622-3 up thy wares 3666 out of the land, 776 O inhabitant 3427-6 of the fortress. 4692

10:18 For thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Behold, I will sling out 7049-6 the inhabitants 3427-6 of the land 776 at this once, 6471 and will distress 6887-52 them, that they may find 4672-4 [it so].

10:19 Woe 188 is me for my hurt! 7667 my wound 4347 is grievous: 2470-12 but I said, 559-1 Truly 389 this [is] a grief, 2483 and I must bear 5375-4 it.

10:20 My tabernacle 168 is spoiled, 7703-27 and all my cords 4340 are broken: 5423-8 my children 1121 are gone forth 3318-1 of me, and they [are] not: [there is] none to stretch forth 5186-6 my tent 168 any more, and to set up 6965-56 my curtains. 3407

10:21 For the pastors 7462-6 are become brutish, 1197-8 and have not sought 1875-1 the LORD: 3068 therefore they shall not prosper, 7919-52 and all their flocks 4830 shall be scattered. 6327-8

10:22 Behold, the noise 6963 of the bruit 8052 is come, 935-6 and a great 1419 commotion 7494 out of the north 6828 country, 776 to make 7760-2 the cities 5892 of Judah 3063 desolate, 8077 [and] a den 4583 of dragons. 8577

10:23 O LORD, 3068 I know 3045-1 that the way 1870 of man 120 [is] not in himself: [it is] not in man 376 that walketh 1980-6 to direct 3559-53 his steps. 6806

10:24 O LORD, 3068 correct 3256-16 me, but with judgment; 4941 not in thine anger, 639 lest thou bring me to nothing. 4591-55

10:25 Pour out 8210-3 thy fury 2534 upon the heathen 1471 that know 3045-1 thee not, and upon the families 4940 that call 7121-1 not on thy name: 8034 for they have eaten up 398-1 Jacob, 3290 and devoured 398-1 him, and consumed 3615-17 him, and have made his habitation 5116 desolate. 8074-52

11:1 The word 1697 that came to Jeremiah 3414 from the LORD, 3068 saying, 559-2

11:2 Hear 8085-3 ye the words 1697 of this covenant, 1285 and speak 1696-14 unto the men 376 of Judah, 3063 and to the inhabitants 3427-6 of Jerusalem; 3389

11:3 And say 559-1 thou unto them, Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel; 3478 Cursed 779-7 [be] the man 376 that obeyeth 8085-4 not the words 1697 of this covenant, 1285

11:4 Which I commanded 6680-14 your fathers 1 in the day 3117 [that] I brought them forth 3318-53 out of the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 from the iron 1270 furnace, 3564 saying, 559-2 Obey 8085-3 my voice, 6963 and do 6213-1 them, according to all which I command 6680-17 you: so shall ye be my people, 5971 and I will be your God: 430

11:5 That I may perform 6965-53 the oath 7621 which I have sworn 7650-8 unto your fathers, 1 to give 5414-2 them a land 776 flowing 2100-6 with milk 2461 and honey, 1706 as [it is] this day. 3117 Then answered 6030-4 I, and said, 559-4 So be it, 543 O LORD. 3068

11:6 Then the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto me, Proclaim 7121-3 all these words 1697 in the cities 5892 of Judah, 3063 and in the streets 2351 of Jerusalem, 3389 saying, 559-2 Hear 8085-3 ye the words 1697 of this covenant, 1285 and do 6213-1 them.

11:7 For I earnestly 5749-53 protested 5749-52 unto your fathers 1 in the day 3117 [that] I brought them up 5927-53 out of the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 [even] unto this day, 3117 rising early 7925-53 and protesting, 5749-53 saying, 559-2 Obey 8085-3 my voice. 6963

11:8 Yet they obeyed 8085-1 not, nor inclined 5186-52 their ear, 241 but walked 3212-4 every one 376 in the imagination 8307 of their evil 7451 heart: 3820 therefore I will bring 935-55 upon them all the words 1697 of this covenant, 1285 which I commanded 6680-14 [them] to do; 6213-2 but they did 6213-1 [them] not.

11:9 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto me, A conspiracy 7195 is found 4672-8 among the men 376 of Judah, 3063 and among the inhabitants 3427-6 of Jerusalem. 3389

11:10 They are turned back 7725-1 to the iniquities 5771 of their forefathers, 7223 1 which refused 3985-14 to hear 8085-2 my words; 1697 and they went 1980-1 after 310 other 312 gods 430 to serve 5647-2 them: the house 1004 of Israel 3478 and the house 1004 of Judah 3063 have broken 6565-52 my covenant 1285 which I made 3772-1 with their fathers. 1

11:11 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Behold, I will bring 935-56 evil 7451 upon them, which they shall not be able 3201-4 to escape; 3318-2 and though they shall cry 2199-1 unto me, I will not hearken 8085-4 unto them.

11:12 Then shall the cities 5892 of Judah 3063 and inhabitants 3427-6 of Jerusalem 3389 go, 1980-1 and cry 2199-1 unto the gods 430 unto whom they offer incense: 6999-18 but they shall not save 3467-55 them at all 3467-53 in the time 6256 of their trouble. 7451

11:13 For [according to] the number 4557 of thy cities 5892 were thy gods, 430 O Judah; 3063 and [according to] the number 4557 of the streets 2351 of Jerusalem 3389 have ye set up 7760-1 altars 4196 to [that] shameful 1322 thing, [even] altars 4196 to burn incense 6999-15 unto Baal. 1168

11:14 Therefore pray 6419-101 not thou for this people, 5971 neither lift up 5375-4 a cry 7440 or prayer 8605 for them: for I will not hear 8085-6 [them] in the time 6256 that they cry 7121-2 unto me for their trouble. 7451

11:15 What hath my beloved 3039 to do in mine house, 1004 [seeing] she hath wrought 6213-2 lewdness 4209 with many, 7227 and the holy 6944 flesh 1320 is passed 5674-4 from thee? when thou doest evil, 7451 then thou rejoicest. 5937-4

11:16 The LORD 3068 called 7121-1 thy name, 8034 A green 7488 olive tree, 2132 fair, 3303 [and] of goodly 8389 fruit: 6529 with the noise 6963 of a great 1419 tumult 1999 he hath kindled 3341-52 fire 784 upon it, and the branches 1808 of it are broken. 7489-1

11:17 For the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 that planted 5193-6 thee, hath pronounced 1696-14 evil 7451 against thee, for 1558 the evil 7451 of the house 1004 of Israel 3478 and of the house 1004 of Judah, 3063 which they have done 6213-1 against themselves to provoke me to anger 3707-53 in offering incense 6999-15 unto Baal. 1168

11:18 And the LORD 3068 hath given me knowledge 3045-52 [of it], and I know 3045-4 [it]: then thou shewedst 7200-52 me their doings. 4611

11:19 But I [was] like a lamb 3532 [or] an ox 441 [that] is brought 2986-93 to the slaughter; 2873-2 and I knew 3045-1 not that they had devised 2803-1 devices 4284 against me, [saying], Let us destroy 7843-55 the tree 6086 with the fruit 3899 thereof, and let us cut him off 3772-4 from the land 776 of the living, 2416 that his name 8034 may be no more remembered. 2142-11

11:20 But, O LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 that judgest 8199-6 righteously, 6664 that triest 974-6 the reins 3629 and the heart, 3820 let me see 7200-4 thy vengeance 5360 on them: for unto thee have I revealed 1540-14 my cause. 7379

11:21 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of the men 582 of Anathoth, 6068 that seek 1245-18 thy life, 5315 saying, 559-2 Prophesy 5012-11 not in the name 8034 of the LORD, 3068 that thou die 4191-4 not by our hand: 3027

11:22 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 Behold, I will punish 6485-6 them: the young men 970 shall die 4191-4 by the sword; 2719 their sons 1121 and their daughters 1323 shall die 4191-4 by famine: 7458

11:23 And there shall be no remnant 7611 of them: for I will bring 935-55 evil 7451 upon the men 582 of Anathoth, 6068 [even] the year 8141 of their visitation. 6486

12:1 Righteous 6662 [art] thou, O LORD, 3068 when I plead 7378-4 with thee: yet let me talk 1696-17 with thee of [thy] judgments: 4941 Wherefore doth the way 1870 of the wicked 7563 prosper? 6743-1 [wherefore] are all they happy 7951-1 that deal very 899 treacherously? 898-6

12:2 Thou hast planted 5193-1 them, yea, they have taken root: 8327-19 they grow, 3212-4 yea, they bring forth 6213-1 fruit: 6529 thou [art] near 7138 in their mouth, 6310 and far 7350 from their reins. 3629

12:3 But thou, O LORD, 3068 knowest 3045-1 me: thou hast seen 7200-4 me, and tried 974-1 mine heart 3820 toward thee: pull them out 5423-54 like sheep 6629 for the slaughter, 2878 and prepare 6942-54 them for the day 3117 of slaughter. 2028

12:4 How long shall the land 776 mourn, 56-4 and the herbs 6212 of every field 7704 wither, 3001-4 for the wickedness 7451 of them that dwell 3427-6 therein? the beasts 929 are consumed, 5595-1 and the birds; 5775 because they said, 559-1 He shall not see 7200-4 our last end. 319

12:5 If thou hast run 7323-1 with the footmen, 7273 and they have wearied 3811-55 thee, then how canst thou contend 8474-96 with horses? 5483 and [if] in the land 776 of peace, 7965 [wherein] thou trustedst, 982-6 [they wearied thee], then how wilt thou do 6213-4 in the swelling 1347 of Jordan? 3383

12:6 For even thy brethren, 251 and the house 1004 of thy father, 1 even they have dealt treacherously 898-1 with thee; yea, they have called 7121-1 a multitude 4392 after 310 thee: believe 539-55 them not, though they speak 1696-17 fair words 2896 unto thee.

12:7 I have forsaken 5800-1 mine house, 1004 I have left 5203-1 mine heritage; 5159 I have given 5414-1 the dearly beloved 3033 of my soul 5315 into the hand 3709 of her enemies. 341-6

12:8 Mine heritage 5159 is unto me as a lion 738 in the forest; 3293 it crieth 5414-1 out 6963 against me: therefore have I hated 8130-1 it.

12:9 Mine heritage 5159 [is] unto me [as] a speckled 6641 bird, 5861 the birds 5861 round about 5439 [are] against her; come 3212-3 ye, assemble 622-3 all the beasts 2416 of the field, 7704 come 857-54 to devour. 402

12:10 Many 7227 pastors 7462-6 have destroyed 7843-14 my vineyard, 3754 they have trodden my portion 2513 under foot, 947-31 they have made 5414-1 my pleasant 2532 portion 2513 a desolate 8077 wilderness. 4057

12:11 They have made 7760-1 it desolate, 8077 [and being] desolate 8076 it mourneth 56-1 unto me; the whole land 776 is made desolate, 8074-8 because no man 376 layeth 7760-6 [it] to heart. 3820

12:12 The spoilers 7703-6 are come 935-1 upon all high places 8205 through the wilderness: 4057 for the sword 2719 of the LORD 3068 shall devour 398-6 from the [one] end 7097 of the land 776 even to the [other] end 7097 of the land: 776 no flesh 1320 shall have peace. 7965

12:13 They have sown 2232-1 wheat, 2406 but shall reap 7114-1 thorns: 6975 they have put themselves to pain, 2470-8 [but] shall not profit: 3276-55 and they shall be ashamed 954-1 of your revenues 8393 because of the fierce 2740 anger 639 of the LORD. 3068

12:14 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 against all mine evil 7451 neighbours, 7934 that touch 5060-6 the inheritance 5159 which I have caused my people 5971 Israel 3478 to inherit; 5157-52 Behold, I will pluck 5428-6 them out of their land, 127 and pluck out 5428-4 the house 1004 of Judah 3063 from among 8432 them.

12:15 And it shall come to pass, after 310 that I have plucked them out 5428-2 I will return, 7725-4 and have compassion 7355-14 on them, and will bring them again, 7725-52 every man 376 to his heritage, 5159 and every man 376 to his land. 776

12:16 And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently 3925-2 learn 3925-4 the ways 1870 of my people, 5971 to swear 7650-9 by my name, 8034 The LORD 3068 liveth; 2416 as they taught 3925-14 my people 5971 to swear 7650-9 by Baal; 1168 then shall they be built 1129-8 in the midst 8432 of my people. 5971

12:17 But if they will not obey, 8085-4 I will utterly 5428-2 pluck up 5428-1 and destroy 6-15 that nation, 1471 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

13:1 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 unto me, Go 1980-2 and get 7069-1 thee a linen 6593 girdle, 232 and put 7760-1 it upon thy loins, 4975 and put 935-55 it not in water. 4325

13:2 So I got 7069-4 a girdle 232 according to the word 1697 of the LORD, 3068 and put 7760-4 [it] on my loins. 4975

13:3 And the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto me the second time, 8145 saying, 559-2

13:4 Take 3947-3 the girdle 232 that thou hast got, 7069-1 which [is] upon thy loins, 4975 and arise, 6965-3 go 3212-3 to Euphrates, 6578 and hide 2934-3 it there in a hole 5357 of the rock. 5553

13:5 So I went, 3212-4 and hid 2934-4 it by Euphrates, 6578 as the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 me.

13:6 And it came to pass after 7093 many 7227 days, 3117 that the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto me, Arise, 6965-3 go 3212-3 to Euphrates, 6578 and take 3947-3 the girdle 232 from thence, which I commanded 6680-14 thee to hide 2934-2 there.

13:7 Then I went 3212-4 to Euphrates, 6578 and digged, 2658-4 and took 3947-4 the girdle 232 from the place 4725 where I had hid 2934-1 it: and, behold, the girdle 232 was marred, 7843-8 it was profitable 6743-4 for nothing.

13:8 Then the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto me, saying, 559-2

13:9 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 After this manner will I mar 7843-55 the pride 1347 of Judah, 3063 and the great 7227 pride 1347 of Jerusalem. 3389

13:10 This evil 7451 people, 5971 which refuse 3987 to hear 8085-2 my words, 1697 which walk 1980-6 in the imagination 8307 of their heart, 3820 and walk 3212-4 after 310 other 312 gods, 430 to serve 5647-2 them, and to worship 7812-99 them, shall even be as this girdle, 232 which is good 6743-4 for nothing.

13:11 For as the girdle 232 cleaveth 1692-4 to the loins 4975 of a man, 376 so have I caused to cleave 1692-52 unto me the whole house 1004 of Israel 3478 and the whole house 1004 of Judah, 3063 saith 5002-7 the LORD; 3068 that they might be unto me for a people, 5971 and for a name, 8034 and for a praise, 8416 and for a glory: 8597 but they would not hear. 8085-1

13:12 Therefore thou shalt speak 559-1 unto them this word; 1697 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel, 3478 Every bottle 5035 shall be filled 4390-11 with wine: 3196 and they shall say 559-1 unto thee, Do we not certainly 3045-2 know 3045-4 that every bottle 5035 shall be filled 4390-11 with wine? 3196

13:13 Then shalt thou say 559-1 unto them, Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Behold, I will fill 4390-18 all the inhabitants 3427-6 of this land, 776 even the kings 4428 that sit 3427-6 upon David's 1732 throne, 3678 and the priests, 3548 and the prophets, 5030 and all the inhabitants 3427-6 of Jerusalem, 3389 with drunkenness. 7943

13:14 And I will dash 5310-14 them one 376 against another, 251 even the fathers 1 and the sons 1121 together, 3162 saith 5002-7 the LORD: 3068 I will not pity, 2550-4 nor spare, 2347-4 nor have mercy, 7355-17 but destroy 7843-53 them.

13:15 Hear 8085-3 ye, and give ear; 238-54 be not proud: 1361-4 for the LORD 3068 hath spoken. 1696-14

13:16 Give 5414-3 glory 3519 to the LORD 3068 your God, 430 before he cause darkness, 2821-55 and before your feet 7272 stumble 5062-101 upon the dark 5399 mountains, 2022 and, while ye look 6960-14 for light, 216 he turn 7760-1 it into the shadow of death, 6757 [and] make 7896-3|7896-4-k [it] gross darkness. 6205

13:17 But if ye will not hear 8085-4 it, my soul 5315 shall weep 1058-4 in secret places 4565 for 6440 [your] pride; 1466 and mine eye 5869 shall weep 1830-4 sore, 1830-2 and run down 3381-4 with tears, 1832 because the LORD'S 3068 flock 5739 is carried away captive. 7617-8

13:18 Say 559-3 unto the king 4428 and to the queen, 1377 Humble 8213-54 yourselves, sit down: 3427-3 for your principalities 4761 shall come down, 3381-1 [even] the crown 5850 of your glory. 8597

13:19 The cities 5892 of the south 5045 shall be shut up, 5462-27 and none shall open 6605-6 [them]: Judah 3063 shall be carried away captive 1540-90 all of it, it shall be wholly 7965 carried away captive. 1540-90

13:20 Lift up 5375-3 your eyes, 5869 and behold 7200-3 them that come 935-6 from the north: 6828 where [is] the flock 5739 [that] was given 5414-8 thee, thy beautiful 8597 flock? 6629

13:21 What wilt thou say 559-4 when he shall punish 6485-4 thee? for thou hast taught 3925-14 them [to be] captains, 441 [and] as chief 7218 over thee: shall not sorrows 2256 take thee, 270-4 as a woman 802 in travail? 3205-2

13:22 And if thou say 559-4 in thine heart, 3824 Wherefore come 7122-1 these things upon me? For the greatness 7230 of thine iniquity 5771 are thy skirts 7757 discovered, 1540-8 [and] thy heels 6119 made bare. 2554-8

13:23 Can the Ethiopian 3569 change 2015-4 his skin, 5785 or the leopard 5246 his spots? 2272 [then] may 3201-4 ye also do good, 3190-53 that are accustomed 3928 to do evil. 7489-53

13:24 Therefore will I scatter 6327-55 them as the stubble 7179 that passeth away 5674-6 by the wind 7307 of the wilderness. 4057

13:25 This [is] thy lot, 1486 the portion 4490 of thy measures 4055 from me, saith 5002-7 the LORD; 3068 because thou hast forgotten 7911-1 me, and trusted 982-4 in falsehood. 8267

13:26 Therefore will I discover 2834-1 thy skirts 7757 upon thy face, 6440 that thy shame 7036 may appear. 7200-8

13:27 I have seen 7200-1 thine adulteries, 5004 and thy neighings, 4684 the lewdness 2154 of thy whoredom, 2184 [and] thine abominations 8251 on the hills 1389 in the fields. 7704 Woe 188 unto thee, O Jerusalem! 3389 wilt thou not be made clean? 2891-4 when 310 [shall it] once 5750 [be]?

14:1 The word 1697 of the LORD 3068 that came to Jeremiah 3414 concerning 1697 the dearth. 1226

14:2 Judah 3063 mourneth, 56-1 and the gates 8179 thereof languish; 535-49 they are black 6937-1 unto the ground; 776 and the cry 6682 of Jerusalem 3389 is gone up. 5927-1

14:3 And their nobles 117 have sent 7971-1 their little ones 6810 to the waters: 4325 they came 935-1 to the pits, 1356|1360-q [and] found 4672-1 no water; 4325 they returned 7725-1 with their vessels 3627 empty; 7387 they were ashamed 954-1 and confounded, 3637-90 and covered 2645-1 their heads. 7218

14:4 Because the ground 127 is chapt, 2865-1 for there was no rain 1653 in the earth, 776 the plowmen 406 were ashamed, 954-1 they covered 2645-1 their heads. 7218

14:5 Yea, the hind 365 also calved 3205-1 in the field, 7704 and forsook 5800-2 [it], because there was no grass. 1877

14:6 And the wild asses 6501 did stand 5975-1 in the high places, 8205 they snuffed up 7602-1 the wind 7307 like dragons; 8577 their eyes 5869 did fail, 3615-1 because [there was] no grass. 6212

14:7 O LORD, 3068 though our iniquities 5771 testify 6030-1 against us, do 6213-3 thou [it] for thy name's 8034 sake: for our backslidings 4878 are many; 7231-1 we have sinned 2398-1 against thee.

14:8 O the hope 4723 of Israel, 3478 the saviour 3467-56 thereof in time 6256 of trouble, 6869 why shouldest thou be as a stranger 1616 in the land, 776 and as a wayfaring man 732-6 [that] turneth aside 5186-1 to tarry for a night? 3885-2

14:9 Why shouldest thou be as a man 376 astonied, 1724-12 as a mighty man 1368 [that] cannot 3808 3201-4 save? 3467-53 yet thou, O LORD, 3068 [art] in the midst 7130 of us, and we are called 7121-8 by thy name; 8034 leave 3240-55 us not.

14:10 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 unto this people, 5971 Thus have they loved 157-1 to wander, 5128-2 they have not refrained 2820-1 their feet, 7272 therefore the LORD 3068 doth not accept 7521-1 them; he will now remember 2142-4 their iniquity, 5771 and visit 6485-4 their sins. 2403

14:11 Then said 559-4 the LORD 3068 unto me, Pray 6419-101 not for this people 5971 for [their] good. 2896

14:12 When they fast, 6684-4 I will not hear 8085-6 their cry; 7440 and when they offer 5927-55 burnt offering 5930 and an oblation, 4503 I will not accept 7521-6 them: but I will consume 3615-18 them by the sword, 2719 and by the famine, 7458 and by the pestilence. 1698

14:13 Then said 559-4 I, Ah, 162 Lord 136 GOD! 3069 behold, the prophets 5030 say 559-6 unto them, Ye shall not see 7200-4 the sword, 2719 neither shall ye have famine; 7458 but I will give 5414-4 you assured 571 peace 7965 in this place. 4725

14:14 Then the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto me, The prophets 5030 prophesy 5012-12 lies 8267 in my name: 8034 I sent 7971-1 them not, neither have I commanded 6680-14 them, neither spake 1696-14 unto them: they prophesy 5012-102 unto you a false 8267 vision 2377 and divination, 7081 and a thing of nought, 434 and the deceit 8649 of their heart. 3820

14:15 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 concerning the prophets 5030 that prophesy 5012-12 in my name, 8034 and I sent 7971-1 them not, yet they say, 559-6 Sword 2719 and famine 7458 shall not be in this land; 776 By sword 2719 and famine 7458 shall those prophets 5030 be consumed. 8552-11

14:16 And the people 5971 to whom they prophesy 5012-12 shall be cast out 7993-94 in the streets 2351 of Jerusalem 3389 because 6440 of the famine 7458 and the sword; 2719 and they shall have none to bury 6912-18 them, 1992 them, their wives, 802 nor their sons, 1121 nor their daughters: 1323 for I will pour 8210-1 their wickedness 7451 upon them.

14:17 Therefore thou shalt say 559-1 this word 1697 unto them; Let mine eyes 5869 run down 3381-4 with tears 1832 night 3915 and day, 3119 and let them not cease: 1820-4 for the virgin 1330 daughter 1323 of my people 5971 is broken 7665-8 with a great 1419 breach, 7667 with a very 3966 grievous 2470-12 blow. 4347

14:18 If I go forth 3318-1 into the field, 7704 then behold the slain 2491 with the sword! 2719 and if I enter 935-1 into the city, 5892 then behold them that are sick 8463 with famine! 7458 yea, both the prophet 5030 and the priest 3548 go about 5503-1 into a land 776 that they know 3045-1 not.

14:19 Hast thou utterly 3988-2 rejected 3988-1 Judah? 3063 hath thy soul 5315 lothed 1602-1 Zion? 6726 why hast thou smitten 5221-52 us, and [there is] no healing 4832 for us? we looked 6960-15 for peace, 7965 and [there is] no good; 2896 and for the time 6256 of healing, 4832 and behold trouble! 1205

14:20 We acknowledge, 3045-1 O LORD, 3068 our wickedness, 7562 [and] the iniquity 5771 of our fathers: 1 for we have sinned 2398-1 against thee.

14:21 Do not abhor 5006-4 [us], for thy name's 8034 sake, do not disgrace 5034-17 the throne 3678 of thy glory: 3519 remember, 2142-3 break 6565-55 not thy covenant 1285 with us.

14:22 Are there 3426 [any] among the vanities 1892 of the Gentiles 1471 that can cause rain? 1652-56 or can the heavens 8064 give 5414-4 showers? 7241 [art] not thou he, O LORD 3068 our God? 430 therefore we will wait 6960-17 upon thee: for thou hast made 6213-1 all these [things].

15:1 Then said 559-4 the LORD 3068 unto me, Though Moses 4872 and Samuel 8050 stood 5975-4 before 6440 me, [yet] my mind 5315 [could] not [be] toward this people: 5971 cast [them] out 7971-16 of my sight, 6440 and let them go forth. 3318-4

15:2 And it shall come to pass, if they say 559-4 unto thee, Whither shall we go forth? 3318-4 then thou shalt tell 559-1 them, Thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 Such as [are] for death, 4194 to death; 4194 and such as [are] for the sword, 2719 to the sword; 2719 and such as [are] for the famine, 7458 to the famine; 7458 and such as [are] for the captivity, 7628 to the captivity. 7628

15:3 And I will appoint 6485-1 over them four 702 kinds, 4940 saith 5002-7 the LORD: 3068 the sword 2719 to slay, 2026-2 and the dogs 3611 to tear, 5498-2 and the fowls 5775 of the heaven, 8064 and the beasts 929 of the earth, 776 to devour 398-2 and destroy. 7843-53

15:4 And I will cause 5414-1 them to be removed 2189|2113-k into all kingdoms 4467 of the earth, 776 because 1558 of Manasseh 4519 the son 1121 of Hezekiah 3169 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 for [that] which he did 6213-1 in Jerusalem. 3389

15:5 For who shall have pity 2550-4 upon thee, O Jerusalem? 3389 or who shall bemoan 5110-4 thee? or who shall go aside 5493-4 to ask 7592-2 how thou doest? 7965

15:6 Thou hast forsaken 5203-1 me, saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 thou art gone 3212-4 backward: 268 therefore will I stretch out 5186-55 my hand 3027 against thee, and destroy 7843-55 thee; I am weary 3811-8 with repenting. 5162-9

15:7 And I will fan 2219-4 them with a fan 4214 in the gates 8179 of the land; 776 I will bereave [them] of children, 7921-14 I will destroy 6-14 my people, 5971 [since] they return 7725-1 not from their ways. 1870

15:8 Their widows 490 are increased 6105-1 to me above the sand 2344 of the seas: 3220 I have brought 935-52 upon them against the mother 517 of the young men 970 a spoiler 7703-6 at noonday: 6672 I have caused [him] to fall 5307-52 upon it suddenly, 6597 and terrors 928 upon the city. 5892

15:9 She that hath borne 3205-6 seven 7651 languisheth: 535-49 she hath given up 5301-1 the ghost; 5315 her sun 8121 is gone down 935-1 while [it was] yet day: 3119|3117-q she hath been ashamed 954-1 and confounded: 2659-1 and the residue 7611 of them will I deliver 5414-4 to the sword 2719 before 6440 their enemies, 341-6 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

15:10 Woe 188 is me, my mother, 517 that thou hast borne 3205-1 me a man 376 of strife 7379 and a man 376 of contention 4066 to the whole earth! 776 I have neither lent on usury, 5383-1 nor men have lent to me on usury; 5383-1 [yet] every one of them doth curse 7043-18 me.

15:11 The LORD 3068 said, 559-1 Verily 3808 518 it shall be well 2896 with thy remnant; 8281-14|8293-k verily 518 I will cause the enemy 341-6 to entreat 6293-52 thee [well] in the time 6256 of evil 7451 and in the time 6256 of affliction. 6869

15:12 Shall iron 1270 break 7489-4 the northern 6828 iron 1270 and the steel? 5178

15:13 Thy substance 2428 and thy treasures 214 will I give 5414-4 to the spoil 957 without price, 4242 and [that] for all thy sins, 2403 even in all thy borders. 1366

15:14 And I will make [thee] to pass 5674-52 with thine enemies 341-6 into a land 776 [which] thou knowest 3045-1 not: for a fire 784 is kindled 6919-1 in mine anger, 639 [which] shall burn 3344-93 upon you.

15:15 O LORD, 3068 thou knowest: 3045-1 remember 2142-3 me, and visit 6485-3 me, and revenge 5358-10 me of my persecutors; 7291-6 take me not away 3947-4 in thy longsuffering: 639 750 know 3045-3 that for thy sake I have suffered 5375-2 rebuke. 2781

15:16 Thy words 1697 were found, 4672-8 and I did eat 398-4 them; and thy word 1697 was unto me the joy 8342 and rejoicing 8057 of mine heart: 3824 for I am called 7121-8 by thy name, 8034 O LORD 3068 God 430 of hosts. 6635

15:17 I sat 3427-1 not in the assembly 5475 of the mockers, 7832-18 nor rejoiced; 5937-4 I sat 3427-1 alone 910 because 6440 of thy hand: 3027 for thou hast filled 4390-14 me with indignation. 2195

15:18 Why is my pain 3511 perpetual, 5331 and my wound 4347 incurable, 605-7 [which] refuseth 3985-14 to be healed? 7495-9 wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar, 391 [and as] waters 4325 [that] fail? 539-8

15:19 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 If thou return, 7725-4 then will I bring thee again, 7725-55 [and] thou shalt stand 5975-4 before 6440 me: and if thou take forth 3318-55 the precious 3368 from the vile, 2151-6 thou shalt be as my mouth: 6310 let them return 7725-4 unto thee; but return 7725-4 not thou unto them.

15:20 And I will make 5414-1 thee unto this people 5971 a fenced 1219-7 brasen 5178 wall: 2346 and they shall fight 3898-8 against thee, but they shall not prevail 3201-4 against thee: for I [am] with thee to save 3467-53 thee and to deliver 5337-53 thee, saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

15:21 And I will deliver 5337-52 thee out of the hand 3027 of the wicked, 7451 and I will redeem 6299-1 thee out of the hand 3709 of the terrible. 6184

16:1 The word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came also unto me, saying, 559-2

16:2 Thou shalt not take 3947-4 thee a wife, 802 neither shalt thou have sons 1121 or daughters 1323 in this place. 4725

16:3 For thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 concerning the sons 1121 and concerning the daughters 1323 that are born 3209 in this place, 4725 and concerning their mothers 517 that bare 3205-6 them, and concerning their fathers 1 that begat 3205-56 them in this land; 776

16:4 They shall die 4191-4 of grievous 8463 deaths; 4463 they shall not be lamented; 5594-11 neither shall they be buried; 6912-11 [but] they shall be as dung 1828 upon the face 6440 of the earth: 127 and they shall be consumed 3615-4 by the sword, 2719 and by famine; 7458 and their carcases 5038 shall be meat 3978 for the fowls 5775 of heaven, 8064 and for the beasts 929 of the earth. 776

16:5 For thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Enter 935-4 not into the house 1004 of mourning, 4798 neither go 3212-4 to lament 5594-2 nor bemoan 5110-4 them: for I have taken away 622-1 my peace 7965 from this people, 5971 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 [even] lovingkindness 2617 and mercies. 7356

16:6 Both the great 1419 and the small 6996 shall die 4191-1 in this land: 776 they shall not be buried, 6912-11 neither shall [men] lament 5594-4 for them, nor cut 1413-108 themselves, nor make themselves bald 7139-11 for them:

16:7 Neither shall [men] tear 6536-4 [themselves] for them in mourning, 60 to comfort 5162-15 them for the dead; 4191-5 neither shall [men] give them the cup 3563 of consolation 8575 to drink 8248-55 for their father 1 or for their mother. 517

16:8 Thou shalt not also go 935-4 into the house 1004 of feasting, 4960 to sit 3427-2 with them to eat 398-2 and to drink. 8354-2

16:9 For thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 the God 430 of Israel; 3478 Behold, I will cause to cease 7673-56 out of this place 4725 in your eyes, 5869 and in your days, 3117 the voice 6963 of mirth, 8342 and the voice 6963 of gladness, 8057 the voice 6963 of the bridegroom, 2860 and the voice 6963 of the bride. 3618

16:10 And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt shew 5046-55 this people 5971 all these words, 1697 and they shall say 559-1 unto thee, Wherefore hath the LORD 3068 pronounced 1696-14 all this great 1419 evil 7451 against us? or what [is] our iniquity? 5771 or what [is] our sin 2403 that we have committed 2398-1 against the LORD 3068 our God? 430

16:11 Then shalt thou say 559-1 unto them, Because your fathers 1 have forsaken 5800-1 me, saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 and have walked 3212-4 after 310 other 312 gods, 430 and have served 5647-4 them, and have worshipped 7812-101 them, and have forsaken 5800-1 me, and have not kept 8104-1 my law; 8451

16:12 And ye have done 6213-2 worse 7489-52 than your fathers; 1 for, behold, 2009 ye walk 1980-6 every one 376 after 310 the imagination 8307 of his evil 7451 heart, 3820 that they may not hearken 8085-2 unto me:

16:13 Therefore will I cast 2904-52 you out of this land 776 into a land 776 that ye know 3045-1 not, [neither] ye nor your fathers; 1 and there shall ye serve 5647-1 other 312 gods 430 day 3119 and night; 3915 where I will not shew 5414-4 you favour. 2594

16:14 Therefore, behold, the days 3117 come, 935-6 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 that it shall no more be said, 559-11 The LORD 3068 liveth, 2416 that brought up 5927-52 the children 1121 of Israel 3478 out of the land 776 of Egypt; 4714

16:15 But, The LORD 3068 liveth, 2416 that brought up 5927-52 the children 1121 of Israel 3478 from the land 776 of the north, 6828 and from all the lands 776 whither he had driven 5080-52 them: and I will bring them again 7725-52 into their land 127 that I gave 5414-1 unto their fathers. 1

16:16 Behold, I will send 7971-6 for many 7227 fishers, 1771|1728-k saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 and they shall fish 1770-1 them; and after 310 will I send 7971-4 for many 7227 hunters, 6719 and they shall hunt 6679-1 them from every mountain, 2022 and from every hill, 1389 and out of the holes 5357 of the rocks. 5553

16:17 For mine eyes 5869 [are] upon all their ways: 1870 they are not hid 5641-8 from my face, 6440 neither is their iniquity 5771 hid 6845-8 from 5048 mine eyes. 5869

16:18 And first 7223 I will recompense 7999-14 their iniquity 5771 and their sin 2403 double; 4932 because they have defiled 2490-15 my land, 776 they have filled 4390-1 mine inheritance 5159 with the carcases 5038 of their detestable 8251 and abominable things. 8441

16:19 O LORD, 3068 my strength, 5797 and my fortress, 4581 and my refuge 4498 in the day 3117 of affliction, 6869 the Gentiles 1471 shall come 935-4 unto thee from the ends 657 of the earth, 776 and shall say, 559-4 Surely our fathers 1 have inherited 5157-1 lies, 8267 vanity, 1892 and [things] wherein [there is] no profit. 3276-56

16:20 Shall a man 120 make 6213-4 gods 430 unto himself, and they [are] no gods? 430

16:21 Therefore, behold, I will this once 6471 cause them to know, 3045-56 I will cause them to know 3045-55 mine hand 3027 and my might; 1369 and they shall know 3045-1 that my name 8034 [is] The LORD. 3068

17:1 The sin 2403 of Judah 3063 [is] written 3789-7 with a pen 5842 of iron, 1270 [and] with the point 6856 of a diamond: 8068 [it is] graven 2790-7 upon the table 3871 of their heart, 3820 and upon the horns 7161 of your altars; 4196

17:2 Whilst their children 1121 remember 2142-2 their altars 4196 and their groves 842 by the green 7488 trees 6086 upon the high 1364 hills. 1389

17:3 O my mountain 2042 in the field, 7704 I will give 5414-4 thy substance 2428 [and] all thy treasures 214 to the spoil, 957 [and] thy high places 1116 for sin, 2403 throughout all thy borders. 1366

17:4 And thou, even thyself, shalt discontinue 8058-1 from thine heritage 5159 that I gave 5414-1 thee; and I will cause thee to serve 5647-52 thine enemies 341-6 in the land 776 which thou knowest 3045-1 not: for ye have kindled 6919-1 a fire 784 in mine anger, 639 [which] shall burn 3344-93 for 5704 ever. 5769

17:5 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 Cursed 779-7 [be] the man 1397 that trusteth 982-4 in man, 120 and maketh 7760-1 flesh 1320 his arm, 2220 and whose heart 3820 departeth 5493-4 from the LORD. 3068

17:6 For he shall be like the heath 6199 in the desert, 6160 and shall not see 7200-4 when good 2896 cometh; 935-4 but shall inhabit 7931-1 the parched places 2788 in the wilderness, 4057 [in] a salt 4420 land 776 and not inhabited. 3427-4

17:7 Blessed 1288-7 [is] the man 1397 that trusteth 982-4 in the LORD, 3068 and whose hope 4009 the LORD 3068 is.

17:8 For he shall be as a tree 6086 planted 8362-7 by the waters, 4325 and [that] spreadeth 7971-17 out her roots 8328 by the river, 3105 and shall not see 7200-4 when heat 2527 cometh, 935-4 but her leaf 5929 shall be green; 7488 and shall not be careful 1672-4 in the year 8141 of drought, 1226 neither shall cease 4185-55 from yielding 6213-2 fruit. 6529

17:9 The heart 3820 [is] deceitful 6121 above all [things], and desperately wicked: 605-7 who can know 3045-4 it?

17:10 I the LORD 3068 search 2713-6 the heart, 3820 [I] try 974-6 the reins, 3629 even to give 5414-2 every man 376 according to his ways, 1870 [and] according to the fruit 6529 of his doings. 4611

17:11 [As] the partridge 7124 sitteth 1716-1 [on eggs], and hatcheth 3205-1 [them] not; [so] he that getteth 6213-6 riches, 6239 and not by right, 4941 shall leave 5800-4 them in the midst 2677 of his days, 3117 and at his end 319 shall be a fool. 5036

17:12 A glorious 3519 high 4791 throne 3678 from the beginning 7223 [is] the place 4725 of our sanctuary. 4720

17:13 O LORD, 3068 the hope 4723 of Israel, 3478 all that forsake 5800-6 thee shall be ashamed, 954-4 [and] they that depart 5493-7|3249-k from me shall be written 3789-11 in the earth, 776 because they have forsaken 5800-1 the LORD, 3068 the fountain 4726 of living 2416 waters. 4325

17:14 Heal 7495-3 me, O LORD, 3068 and I shall be healed; 7495-11 save 3467-54 me, and I shall be saved: 3467-11 for thou [art] my praise. 8416

17:15 Behold, they say 559-6 unto me, Where [is] the word 1697 of the LORD? 3068 let it come 935-4 now.

17:16 As for me, I have not hastened 213-1 from [being] a pastor 7462-6 to follow 310 thee: neither have I desired 183-98 the woeful 605-7 day; 3117 thou knowest: 3045-1 that which came out 4161 of my lips 8193 was [right] before 5227 thee. 6440

17:17 Be not a terror 4288 unto me: thou [art] my hope 4268 in the day 3117 of evil. 7451

17:18 Let them be confounded 954-4 that persecute 7291-6 me, but let not me be confounded: 954-4 let them be dismayed, 2865-11 but let not me be dismayed: 2865-11 bring 935-53 upon them the day 3117 of evil, 7451 and destroy 7665-3 them with double 4932 destruction. 7670

17:19 Thus said 559-1 the LORD 3068 unto me; Go 1980-2 and stand 5975-1 in the gate 8179 of the children 1121 of the people, 5971 whereby the kings 4428 of Judah 3063 come in, 935-4 and by the which they go out, 3318-4 and in all the gates 8179 of Jerusalem; 3389

17:20 And say 559-1 unto them, Hear 8085-3 ye the word 1697 of the LORD, 3068 ye kings 4428 of Judah, 3063 and all Judah, 3063 and all the inhabitants 3427-6 of Jerusalem, 3389 that enter in 935-6 by these gates: 8179

17:21 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 Take heed 8104-10 to yourselves, 5315 and bear 5375-4 no burden 4853 on the sabbath 7676 day, 3117 nor bring [it] in 935-52 by the gates 8179 of Jerusalem; 3389

17:22 Neither carry forth 3318-55 a burden 4853 out of your houses 1004 on the sabbath 7676 day, 3117 neither do 6213-4 ye any work, 4399 but hallow 6942-14 ye the sabbath 7676 day, 3117 as I commanded 6680-14 your fathers. 1

17:23 But they obeyed 8085-1 not, neither inclined 5186-52 their ear, 241 but made their neck 6203 stiff, 7185-55 that they might not hear, 8085-2 nor receive 3947-2 instruction. 4148

17:24 And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently 8085-2 hearken 8085-4 unto me, saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 to bring in 935-53 no burden 4853 through the gates 8179 of this city 5892 on the sabbath 7676 day, 3117 but hallow 6942-15 the sabbath 7676 day, 3117 to do 6213-2 no 1115 work 4399 therein;

17:25 Then shall there enter 935-1 into the gates 8179 of this city 5892 kings 4428 and princes 8269 sitting 3427-6 upon the throne 3678 of David, 1732 riding 7392-6 in chariots 7393 and on horses, 5483 they, and their princes, 8269 the men 376 of Judah, 3063 and the inhabitants 3427-6 of Jerusalem: 3389 and this city 5892 shall remain 3427-1 for ever. 5769

17:26 And they shall come 935-1 from the cities 5892 of Judah, 3063 and from the places about 5439 Jerusalem, 3389 and from the land 776 of Benjamin, 1144 and from the plain, 8219 and from the mountains, 2022 and from the south, 5045 bringing 935-56 burnt offerings, 5930 and sacrifices, 2077 and meat offerings, 4503 and incense, 3828 and bringing 935-56 sacrifices of praise, 8426 unto the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068

17:27 But if ye will not hearken 8085-4 unto me to hallow 6942-15 the sabbath 7676 day, 3117 and not to bear 5375-2 a burden, 4853 even entering in 935-2 at the gates 8179 of Jerusalem 3389 on the sabbath 7676 day; 3117 then will I kindle 3341-52 a fire 784 in the gates 8179 thereof, and it shall devour 398-1 the palaces 759 of Jerusalem, 3389 and it shall not be quenched. 3518-4

18:1 The word 1697 which came to Jeremiah 3414 from the LORD, 3068 saying, 559-2

18:2 Arise, 6965-3 and go down 3381-1 to the potter's 3335-6 house, 1004 and there I will cause thee to hear 8085-55 my words. 1697

18:3 Then I went down 3381-4 to the potter's 3335-6 house, 1004 and, behold, 2009 he wrought 6213-6 a work 4399 on the wheels. 70

18:4 And the vessel 3627 that he made 6213-6 of clay 2563 was marred 7843-8 in the hand 3027 of the potter: 3335-6 so he made 6213-4 it again 7725-1 another 312 vessel, 3627 as seemed 5869 good 3474-1 to the potter 3335-6 to make 6213-2 [it].

18:5 Then the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came to me, saying, 559-2

18:6 O house 1004 of Israel, 3478 cannot 3808 3201-4 I do 6213-2 with you as this potter? 3335-6 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068 Behold, as the clay 2563 [is] in the potter's 3335-6 hand, 3027 so [are] ye in mine hand, 3027 O house 1004 of Israel. 3478

18:7 [At what] instant 7281 I shall speak 1696-17 concerning a nation, 1471 and concerning a kingdom, 4467 to pluck up, 5428-2 and to pull down, 5422-2 and to destroy 6-53 [it];

18:8 If that nation, 1471 against whom I have pronounced, 1696-14 turn 7725-1 from their evil, 7451 I will repent 5162-8 of the evil 7451 that I thought 2803-1 to do 6213-2 unto them.

18:9 And [at what] instant 7281 I shall speak 1696-17 concerning a nation, 1471 and concerning a kingdom, 4467 to build 1129-2 and to plant 5193-2 [it];

18:10 If it do 6213-1 evil 7451 in my sight, 5869 that it obey 8085-2 not my voice, 6963 then I will repent 5162-8 of the good, 2896 wherewith I said 559-1 I would benefit 3190-53 them.

18:11 Now therefore go to, speak 559-3 to the men 376 of Judah, 3063 and to the inhabitants 3427-6 of Jerusalem, 3389 saying, 559-2 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 Behold, I frame 3335-6 evil 7451 against you, and devise 2803-6 a device 4284 against you: return 7725-3 ye now every one 376 from his evil 7451 way, 1870 and make your ways 1870 and your doings 4611 good. 3190-54

18:12 And they said, 559-1 There is no hope: 2976-12 but we will walk 3212-4 after 310 our own devices, 4284 and we will every one 376 do 6213-4 the imagination 8307 of his evil 7451 heart. 3820

18:13 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 Ask 7592-3 ye now among the heathen, 1471 who hath heard 8085-1 such things: the virgin 1330 of Israel 3478 hath done 6213-1 a very 3966 horrible thing. 8186

18:14 Will [a man] leave 5800-4 the snow 7950 of Lebanon 3844 [which cometh] from the rock 6697 of the field? 7704 [or] shall the cold 7119 flowing 5140-6 waters 4325 that come from another place 2114-5 be forsaken? 5428-11

18:15 Because my people 5971 hath forgotten 7911-1 me, they have burned incense 6999-17 to vanity, 7723 and they have caused them to stumble 3782-55 in their ways 1870 [from] the ancient 5769 paths, 7635|7635-k to walk 3212-2 in paths, 5410 [in] a way 1870 not cast up; 5549-7

18:16 To make 7760-2 their land 776 desolate, 8047 [and] a perpetual 5769 hissing; 8292|8292-k every one that passeth 5674-6 thereby shall be astonished, 8074-4 and wag 5110-55 his head. 7218

18:17 I will scatter 6327-55 them as with an east 6921 wind 7307 before 6440 the enemy; 341-6 I will shew 7200-4 them the back, 6203 and not the face, 6440 in the day 3117 of their calamity. 343

18:18 Then said 559-4 they, Come, 3212-3 and let us devise 2803-4 devices 4284 against Jeremiah; 3414 for the law 8451 shall not perish 6-4 from the priest, 3548 nor counsel 6098 from the wise, 2450 nor the word 1697 from the prophet. 5030 Come, 3212-3 and let us smite 5221-55 him with the tongue, 3956 and let us not give heed 7181-55 to any of his words. 1697

18:19 Give heed 7181-54 to me, O LORD, 3068 and hearken 8085-3 to the voice 6963 of them that contend 3401 with me.

18:20 Shall evil 7451 be recompensed 7999-29 for good? 2896 for they have digged 3738-1 a pit 7745 for my soul. 5315 Remember 2142-3 that I stood 5975-2 before 6440 thee to speak 1696-15 good 2896 for them, [and] to turn away 7725-53 thy wrath 2534 from them.

18:21 Therefore deliver up 5414-3 their children 1121 to the famine, 7458 and pour out 5064-54 their [blood] by the force 3027 of the sword; 2719 and let their wives 802 be bereaved 7909 of their children, and [be] widows; 490 and let their men 582 be put 2026-7 to death; 4194 [let] their young men 970 [be] slain 5221-94 by the sword 2719 in battle. 4421

18:22 Let a cry 2201 be heard 8085-11 from their houses, 1004 when thou shalt bring 935-55 a troop 1416 suddenly 6597 upon them: for they have digged 3738-1 a pit 7745|7882-k to take 3920-2 me, and hid 2934-1 snares 6341 for my feet. 7272

18:23 Yet, LORD, 3068 thou knowest 3045-1 all their counsel 6098 against me to slay 4194 [me]: forgive 3722-17 not their iniquity, 5771 neither blot out 4229-55 their sin 2403 from thy sight, 6440 but let them be overthrown 3782-94 before 6440 thee; deal 6213-3 [thus] with them in the time 6256 of thine anger. 639

19:1 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Go 1980-2 and get 7069-1 a potter's 3335-6 earthen 2789 bottle, 1228 and [take] of the ancients 2205 of the people, 5971 and of the ancients 2205 of the priests; 3548

19:2 And go forth 3318-1 unto the valley 1516 of the son 1121 of Hinnom, 2011 which [is] by the entry 6607 of the east 2777 gate, 8179 and proclaim 7121-1 there the words 1697 that I shall tell 1696-17 thee,

19:3 And say, 559-1 Hear 8085-3 ye the word 1697 of the LORD, 3068 O kings 4428 of Judah, 3063 and inhabitants 3427-6 of Jerusalem; 3389 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 the God 430 of Israel; 3478 Behold, I will bring 935-56 evil 7451 upon this place, 4725 the which whosoever heareth, 8085-6 his ears 241 shall tingle. 6750-4

19:4 Because they have forsaken 5800-1 me, and have estranged 5234-17 this place, 4725 and have burned incense 6999-17 in it unto other 312 gods, 430 whom neither they nor their fathers 1 have known, 3045-1 nor the kings 4428 of Judah, 3063 and have filled 4390-1 this place 4725 with the blood 1818 of innocents; 5355

19:5 They have built 1129-1 also the high places 1116 of Baal, 1168 to burn 8313-2 their sons 1121 with fire 784 [for] burnt offerings 5930 unto Baal, 1168 which I commanded 6680-14 not, nor spake 1696-14 [it], neither came 5927-1 [it] into my mind: 3820

19:6 Therefore, behold, the days 3117 come, 935-6 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 that this place 4725 shall no more be called 7121-11 Tophet, 8612 nor The valley 1516 of the son 1121 of Hinnom, 2011 but The valley 1516 of slaughter. 2028

19:7 And I will make void 1238-1 the counsel 6098 of Judah 3063 and Jerusalem 3389 in this place; 4725 and I will cause them to fall 5307-52 by the sword 2719 before 6440 their enemies, 341-6 and by the hands 3027 of them that seek 1245-18 their lives: 5315 and their carcases 5038 will I give 5414-1 to be meat 3978 for the fowls 5775 of the heaven, 8064 and for the beasts 929 of the earth. 776

19:8 And I will make 7760-1 this city 5892 desolate, 8047 and an hissing; 8322 every one that passeth 5674-6 thereby shall be astonished 8074-4 and hiss 8319-4 because of all the plagues 4347 thereof.

19:9 And I will cause them to eat 398-52 the flesh 1320 of their sons 1121 and the flesh 1320 of their daughters, 1323 and they shall eat 398-4 every one 376 the flesh 1320 of his friend 7453 in the siege 4692 and straitness, 4689 wherewith their enemies, 341-6 and they that seek 1245-18 their lives, 5315 shall straiten 6693-55 them.

19:10 Then shalt thou break 7665-1 the bottle 1228 in the sight 5869 of the men 582 that go 1980-6 with thee,

19:11 And shalt say 559-1 unto them, Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts; 6635 Even so 3602 will I break 7665-4 this people 5971 and this city, 5892 as [one] breaketh 7665-4 a potter's 3335-6 vessel, 3627 that cannot 3808 3201-4 be made whole 7495-9 again: and they shall bury 6912-4 [them] in Tophet, 8612 till [there be] no place 4725 to bury. 6912-2

19:12 Thus will I do 6213-4 unto this place, 4725 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 and to the inhabitants 3427-6 thereof, and [even] make 5414-2 this city 5892 as Tophet: 8612

19:13 And the houses 1004 of Jerusalem, 3389 and the houses 1004 of the kings 4428 of Judah, 3063 shall be defiled 2931 as the place 4725 of Tophet, 8612 because of all the houses 1004 upon whose roofs 1406 they have burned incense 6999-14 unto all the host 6635 of heaven, 8064 and have poured out 5258-53 drink offerings 5262 unto other 312 gods. 430

19:14 Then came 935-4 Jeremiah 3414 from Tophet, 8612 whither the LORD 3068 had sent 7971-1 him to prophesy; 5012-9 and he stood 5975-4 in the court 2691 of the LORD'S 3068 house; 1004 and said 559-4 to all the people, 5971

19:15 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 the God 430 of Israel; 3478 Behold, I will bring 935-56 upon this city 5892 and upon all her towns 5892 all the evil 7451 that I have pronounced 1696-14 against it, because they have hardened 7185-52 their necks, 6203 that they might not hear 8085-2 my words. 1697

20:1 Now Pashur 6583 the son 1121 of Immer 564 the priest, 3548 who [was] also chief 5057 governor 6496 in the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 heard 8085-4 that Jeremiah 3414 prophesied 5012-8 these things. 1697

20:2 Then Pashur 6583 smote 5221-55 Jeremiah 3414 the prophet, 5030 and put 5414-4 him in the stocks 4115 that [were] in the high 5945 gate 8179 of Benjamin, 1144 which [was] by the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068

20:3 And it came to pass on the morrow, 4283 that Pashur 6583 brought forth 3318-55 Jeremiah 3414 out of the stocks. 4115 Then said 559-4 Jeremiah 3414 unto him, The LORD 3068 hath not called 7121-1 thy name 8034 Pashur, 6583 but Magormissabib. 4036

20:4 For thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Behold, I will make 5414-6 thee a terror 4032 to thyself, and to all thy friends: 157-6 and they shall fall 5307-1 by the sword 2719 of their enemies, 341-6 and thine eyes 5869 shall behold 7200-6 [it]: and I will give 5414-4 all Judah 3063 into the hand 3027 of the king 4428 of Babylon, 894 and he shall carry them captive 1540-52 into Babylon, 894 and shall slay 5221-52 them with the sword. 2719

20:5 Moreover I will deliver 5414-1 all the strength 2633 of this city, 5892 and all the labours 3018 thereof, and all the precious things 3366 thereof, and all the treasures 214 of the kings 4428 of Judah 3063 will I give 5414-4 into the hand 3027 of their enemies, 341-6 which shall spoil 962-1 them, and take 3947-1 them, and carry 935-52 them to Babylon. 894

20:6 And thou, Pashur, 6583 and all that dwell 3427-6 in thine house 1004 shall go 3212-4 into captivity: 7628 and thou shalt come 935-4 to Babylon, 894 and there thou shalt die, 4191-4 and shalt be buried 6912-11 there, thou, and all thy friends, 157-6 to whom thou hast prophesied 5012-8 lies. 8267

20:7 O LORD, 3068 thou hast deceived 6601-14 me, and I was deceived: 6601-11 thou art stronger 2388-1 than I, and hast prevailed: 3201-4 I am in derision 7814 daily, 3117 every one mocketh 3932-6 me.

20:8 For since 1767 I spake, 1696-17 I cried out, 2199-4 I cried 7121-4 violence 2555 and spoil; 7701 because the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 was made a reproach 2781 unto me, and a derision, 7047 daily. 3117

20:9 Then I said, 559-1 I will not make mention 2142-4 of him, nor speak 1696-17 any more in his name. 8034 But [his word] was in mine heart 3820 as a burning 1197-6 fire 784 shut up 6113-7 in my bones, 6106 and I was weary 3811-8 with forbearing, 3557-44 and I could 3201-4 not [stay].

20:10 For I heard 8085-1 the defaming 1681 of many, 7227 fear 4032 on every side. 5439 Report, 5046-54 [say they], and we will report 5046-55 it. All my familiars 582 7965 watched 8104-6 for my halting, 6763|6761 [saying], Peradventure he will be enticed, 6601-29 and we shall prevail 3201-4 against him, and we shall take 3947-4 our revenge 5360 on him.

20:11 But the LORD 3068 [is] with me as a mighty 1368 terrible one: 6184 therefore my persecutors 7291-6 shall stumble, 3782-11 and they shall not prevail: 3201-4 they shall be greatly 3966 ashamed; 954-1 for they shall not prosper: 7919-52 [their] everlasting 5769 confusion 3639 shall never be forgotten. 7911-11

20:12 But, O LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 that triest 974-6 the righteous, 6662 [and] seest 7200-6 the reins 3629 and the heart, 3820 let me see 7200-4 thy vengeance 5360 on them: for unto thee have I opened 1540-14 my cause. 7379

20:13 Sing 7891-3 unto the LORD, 3068 praise 1984-16 ye the LORD: 3068 for he hath delivered 5337-52 the soul 5315 of the poor 34 from the hand 3027 of evildoers. 7489-56

20:14 Cursed 779-7 [be] the day 3117 wherein I was born: 3205-27 let not the day 3117 wherein my mother 517 bare 3205-1 me be blessed. 1288-7

20:15 Cursed 779-7 [be] the man 376 who brought tidings 1319-14 to my father, 1 saying, 559-2 A man 2145 child 1121 is born 3205-27 unto thee; making him very 8055-15 glad. 8055-14

20:16 And let that man 376 be as the cities 5892 which the LORD 3068 overthrew, 2015-1 and repented 5162-8 not: and let him hear 8085-1 the cry 2201 in the morning, 1242 and the shouting 8643 at noontide; 6256 6672

20:17 Because he slew 4191-31 me not from the womb; 7358 or that my mother 517 might have been my grave, 6913 and her womb 7358 [to be] always 5769 great 2030 [with me].

20:18 Wherefore came I forth 3318-1 out of the womb 7358 to see 7200-2 labour 5999 and sorrow, 3015 that my days 3117 should be consumed 3615-4 with shame? 1322

21:1 The word 1697 which came unto Jeremiah 3414 from the LORD, 3068 when king 4428 Zedekiah 6667 sent 7971-2 unto him Pashur 6583 the son 1121 of Melchiah, 4441 and Zephaniah 6846 the son 1121 of Maaseiah 4641 the priest, 3548 saying, 559-2

21:2 Enquire, 1875-3 I pray thee, of the LORD 3068 for us; 1157 for Nebuchadrezzar 5019 king 4428 of Babylon 894 maketh war 3898-12 against us; if so be that the LORD 3068 will deal 6213-4 with us according to all his wondrous works, 6381-12 that he may go up 5927-4 from us.

21:3 Then said 559-4 Jeremiah 3414 unto them, Thus shall ye say 559-4 to Zedekiah: 6667

21:4 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel; 3478 Behold, I will turn back 5437-56 the weapons 3627 of war 4421 that [are] in your hands, 3027 wherewith ye fight 3898-12 against the king 4428 of Babylon, 894 and [against] the Chaldeans, 3778 which besiege 6696-6 you without 2351 the walls, 2346 and I will assemble 622-1 them into the midst 8432 of this city. 5892

21:5 And I myself will fight 3898-8 against you with an outstretched 5186-7 hand 3027 and with a strong 2389 arm, 2220 even in anger, 639 and in fury, 2534 and in great 1419 wrath. 7110

21:6 And I will smite 5221-52 the inhabitants 3427-6 of this city, 5892 both man 120 and beast: 929 they shall die 4191-4 of a great 1419 pestilence. 1698

21:7 And afterward, 310 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 I will deliver 5414-4 Zedekiah 6667 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 and his servants, 5650 and the people, 5971 and such as are left 7604-12 in this city 5892 from the pestilence, 1698 from the sword, 2719 and from the famine, 7458 into the hand 3027 of Nebuchadrezzar 5019 king 4428 of Babylon, 894 and into the hand 3027 of their enemies, 341-6 and into the hand 3027 of those that seek 1245-18 their life: 5315 and he shall smite 5221-52 them with the edge 6310 of the sword; 2719 he shall not spare 2347-4 them, neither have pity, 2550-4 nor have mercy. 7355-17

21:8 And unto this people 5971 thou shalt say, 559-4 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 Behold, I set 5414-6 before 6440 you the way 1870 of life, 2416 and the way 1870 of death. 4194

21:9 He that abideth 3427-6 in this city 5892 shall die 4191-4 by the sword, 2719 and by the famine, 7458 and by the pestilence: 1698 but he that goeth out, 3318-6 and falleth 5307-1 to the Chaldeans 3778 that besiege 6696-6 you, he shall live, 2421-1|2421-4-k and his life 5315 shall be unto him for a prey. 7998

21:10 For I have set 7760-1 my face 6440 against this city 5892 for evil, 7451 and not for good, 2896 saith 5002-7 the LORD: 3068 it shall be given 5414-11 into the hand 3027 of the king 4428 of Babylon, 894 and he shall burn 8313-1 it with fire. 784

21:11 And touching the house 1004 of the king 4428 of Judah, 3063 [say], Hear 8085-3 ye the word 1697 of the LORD; 3068

21:12 O house 1004 of David, 1732 thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 Execute 1777-3 judgment 4941 in the morning, 1242 and deliver 5337-54 [him that is] spoiled 1497-7 out of the hand 3027 of the oppressor, 6231-6 lest my fury 2534 go out 3318-4 like fire, 784 and burn 1197-1 that none can quench 3518-18 [it], because 6440 of the evil 7455 of your doings. 4611

21:13 Behold, I [am] against thee, O inhabitant 3427-6 of the valley, 6010 [and] rock 6697 of the plain, 4334 saith 5002-7 the LORD; 3068 which say, 559-6 Who shall come down 5181-4 against us? or who shall enter 935-4 into our habitations? 4585

21:14 But I will punish 6485-1 you according to the fruit 6529 of your doings, 4611 saith 5002-7 the LORD: 3068 and I will kindle 3341-52 a fire 784 in the forest 3293 thereof, and it shall devour 398-1 all things round about 5439 it.

22:1 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 Go down 3381-3 to the house 1004 of the king 4428 of Judah, 3063 and speak 1696-14 there this word, 1697

22:2 And say, 559-1 Hear 8085-3 the word 1697 of the LORD, 3068 O king 4428 of Judah, 3063 that sittest 3427-6 upon the throne 3678 of David, 1732 thou, and thy servants, 5650 and thy people 5971 that enter in 935-6 by these gates: 8179

22:3 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 Execute 6213-3 ye judgment 4941 and righteousness, 6666 and deliver 5337-54 the spoiled 1497-7 out of the hand 3027 of the oppressor: 6216 and do no wrong, 3238-55 do no violence 2554-4 to the stranger, 1616 the fatherless, 3490 nor the widow, 490 neither shed 8210-4 innocent 5355 blood 1818 in this place. 4725

22:4 For if ye do 6213-4 this thing 1697 indeed, 6213-2 then shall there enter in 935-1 by the gates 8179 of this house 1004 kings 4428 sitting 3427-6 upon the throne 3678 of David, 1732 riding 7392-6 in chariots 7393 and on horses, 5483 he, and his servants, 5650 and his people. 5971

22:5 But if ye will not hear 8085-4 these words, 1697 I swear 7650-8 by myself, saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 that this house 1004 shall become a desolation. 2723

22:6 For thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 unto the king's 4428 house 1004 of Judah; 3063 Thou [art] Gilead 1568 unto me, [and] the head 7218 of Lebanon: 3844 [yet] surely I will make 7896-4 thee a wilderness, 4057 [and] cities 5892 [which] are not inhabited. 3427-8|3427-12-k

22:7 And I will prepare 6942-14 destroyers 7843-56 against thee, every one 376 with his weapons: 3627 and they shall cut down 3772-1 thy choice 4005 cedars, 730 and cast 5307-52 [them] into the fire. 784

22:8 And many 7227 nations 1471 shall pass by 5674-1 this city, 5892 and they shall say 559-1 every man 376 to his neighbour, 7453 Wherefore hath the LORD 3068 done 6213-1 thus unto this great 1419 city? 5892

22:9 Then they shall answer, 559-1 Because they have forsaken 5800-1 the covenant 1285 of the LORD 3068 their God, 430 and worshipped 7812-101 other 312 gods, 430 and served 5647-4 them.

22:10 Weep 1058-4 ye not for the dead, 4191-5 neither bemoan 5110-4 him: [but] weep 1058-3 sore 1058-2 for him that goeth away: 1980-6 for he shall return 7725-4 no more, nor see 7200-1 his native 4138 country. 776

22:11 For thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 touching 413 Shallum 7967 the son 1121 of Josiah 2977 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 which reigned 4427-6 instead of Josiah 2977 his father, 1 which went forth 3318-1 out of this place; 4725 He shall not return 7725-4 thither any more:

22:12 But he shall die 4191-4 in the place 4725 whither they have led him captive, 1540-52 and shall see 7200-4 this land 776 no more.

22:13 Woe 1945 unto him that buildeth 1129-6 his house 1004 by unrighteousness, 3808 6664 and his chambers 5944 by wrong; 1097 4941 [that] useth his neighbour's 7453 service 5647-4 without wages, 2600 and giveth 5414-4 him not for his work; 6467

22:14 That saith, 559-6 I will build 1129-4 me a wide 4060 house 1004 and large 7304-30 chambers, 5944 and cutteth him out 7167-1 windows; 2474 and [it is] cieled 5603-7 with cedar, 730 and painted 4886-2 with vermilion. 8350

22:15 Shalt thou reign, 4427-4 because thou closest 8474-97 [thyself] in cedar? 730 did not thy father 1 eat 398-1 and drink, 8354-1 and do 6213-1 judgment 4941 and justice, 6666 [and] then [it was] well 2896 with him?

22:1 He judged 1777-1 the cause 1779 of the poor 6041 and needy; 34 then [it was] well 2896 [with him: was] not this to know 1847 me? saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

22:17 But thine eyes 5869 and thine heart 3820 [are] not but for thy covetousness, 1215 and for to shed 8210-2 innocent 5355 blood, 1818 and for oppression, 6233 and for violence, 4835 to do 6213-2 [it].

22:18 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 concerning Jehoiakim 3079 the son 1121 of Josiah 2977 king 4428 of Judah; 3063 They shall not lament 5594-4 for him, [saying], Ah 1945 my brother! 251 or, Ah 1945 sister! 269 they shall not lament 5594-4 for him, [saying], Ah 1945 lord! 113 or, Ah 1945 his glory! 1935

22:19 He shall be buried 6912-11 with the burial 6900 of an ass, 2543 drawn 5498-2 and cast forth 7993-53 beyond 1973 the gates 8179 of Jerusalem. 3389

22:20 Go up 5927-3 to Lebanon, 3844 and cry; 6817-3 and lift up 5414-3 thy voice 6963 in Bashan, 1316 and cry 6817-3 from the passages: 5676|5682 for all thy lovers 157-18 are destroyed. 7665-8

22:21 I spake 1696-14 unto thee in thy prosperity; 7962 [but] thou saidst, 559-1 I will not hear. 8085-4 This [hath been] thy manner 1870 from thy youth, 5271 that thou obeyedst 8085-1 not my voice. 6963

22:22 The wind 7307 shall eat up 7462-4 all thy pastors, 7462-6 and thy lovers 157-18 shall go 3212-4 into captivity: 7628 surely then shalt thou be ashamed 954-4 and confounded 3637-8 for all thy wickedness. 7451

22:23 O inhabitant 3427-6 of Lebanon, 3844 that makest thy nest 7077-30 in the cedars, 730 how gracious 2603-8 shalt thou be when pangs 2256 come 935-2 upon thee, the pain 2427 as of a woman in travail! 3205-6

22:24 [As] I live, 2416 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 though Coniah 3659 the son 1121 of Jehoiakim 3079 king 4428 of Judah 3063 were the signet 2368 upon my right 3225 hand, 3027 yet would I pluck 5423-4 thee thence;

22:25 And I will give 5414-1 thee into the hand 3027 of them that seek 1245-18 thy life, 5315 and into the hand 3027 [of them] whose face 6440 thou fearest, 3016-5 even into the hand 3027 of Nebuchadrezzar 5019 king 4428 of Babylon, 894 and into the hand 3027 of the Chaldeans. 3778

22:26 And I will cast thee out, 2904-52 and thy mother 517 that bare 3205-1 thee, into another 312 country, 776 where ye were not born; 3205-27 and there shall ye die. 4191-4

22:27 But to the land 776 whereunto they desire 5375-18 5315 to return, 7725-2 thither shall they not return. 7725-4

22:28 [Is] this man 376 Coniah 3659 a despised 959-12 broken 5310-7 idol? 6089 [is he] a vessel 3627 wherein [is] no pleasure? 2656 wherefore are they cast out, 2904-90 he and his seed, 2233 and are cast 7993-90 into a land 776 which they know 3045-1 not?

22:29 O earth, 776 earth, 776 earth, 776 hear 8085-3 the word 1697 of the LORD. 3068

22:30 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Write 3789-3 ye this man 376 childless, 6185 a man 1397 [that] shall not prosper 6743-4 in his days: 3117 for no man 376 of his seed 2233 shall prosper, 6743-4 sitting 3427-6 upon the throne 3678 of David, 1732 and ruling 4910-6 any more in Judah. 3063

23:1 Woe 1945 be unto the pastors 7462-6 that destroy 6-18 and scatter 6327-56 the sheep 6629 of my pasture! 4830 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

23:2 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel 3478 against the pastors 7462-6 that feed 7462-6 my people; 5971 Ye have scattered 6327-52 my flock, 6629 and driven them away, 5080-55 and have not visited 6485-1 them: behold, I will visit 6485-6 upon you the evil 7455 of your doings, 4611 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

23:3 And I will gather 6908-17 the remnant 7611 of my flock 6629 out of all countries 776 whither I have driven 5080-52 them, and will bring them again 7725-52 to their folds; 5116 and they shall be fruitful 6509-1 and increase. 7235-1

23:4 And I will set up 6965-52 shepherds 7462-6 over them which shall feed 7462-1 them: and they shall fear 3372-4 no more, nor be dismayed, 2865-11 neither shall they be lacking, 6485-11 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

23:5 Behold, the days 3117 come, 935-6 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 that I will raise 6965-52 unto David 1732 a righteous 6662 Branch, 6780 and a King 4428 shall reign 4427-1 and prosper, 7919-52 and shall execute 6213-1 judgment 4941 and justice 6666 in the earth. 776

23:6 In his days 3117 Judah 3063 shall be saved, 3467-11 and Israel 3478 shall dwell 7931-4 safely: 983 and this [is] his name 8034 whereby he shall be called, 7121-4 THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS. 3068|6664|3072

23:7 Therefore, behold, the days 3117 come, 935-6 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 that they shall no more say, 559-4 The LORD 3068 liveth, 2416 which brought up 5927-52 the children 1121 of Israel 3478 out of the land 776 of Egypt; 4714

23:8 But, The LORD 3068 liveth, 2416 which brought up 5927-52 and which led 935-52 the seed 2233 of the house 1004 of Israel 3478 out of the north 6828 country, 776 and from all countries 776 whither I had driven 5080-52 them; and they shall dwell 3427-1 in their own land. 127

23:9 Mine heart 3820 within 7130 me is broken 7665-8 because of the prophets; 5030 all my bones 6106 shake; 7363-1 I am like a drunken 7910 man, 376 and like a man 1397 whom wine 3196 hath overcome, 5674-1 because 6440 of the LORD, 3068 and because 6440 of the words 1697 of his holiness. 6944

23:10 For the land 776 is full 4390-1 of adulterers; 5003-18 for because 6440 of swearing 423 the land 776 mourneth; 56-1 the pleasant places 4999 of the wilderness 4057 are dried up, 3001-1 and their course 4794 is evil, 7451 and their force 1369 [is] not right.

23:11 For both prophet 5030 and priest 3548 are profane; 2610-1 yea, in my house 1004 have I found 4672-1 their wickedness, 7451 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

23:12 Wherefore their way 1870 shall be unto them as slippery 2519 [ways] in the darkness: 653 they shall be driven on, 1760-11 and fall 5307-1 therein: for I will bring 935-55 evil 7451 upon them, [even] the year 8141 of their visitation, 6486 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

23:13 And I have seen 7200-1 folly 8604 in the prophets 5030 of Samaria; 8111 they prophesied 5012-98 in Baal, 1168 and caused my people 5971 Israel 3478 to err. 8582-55

23:14 I have seen 7200-1 also in the prophets 5030 of Jerusalem 3389 an horrible thing: 8186 they commit adultery, 5003-2 and walk 1980-2 in lies: 8267 they strengthen 2388-14 also the hands 3027 of evildoers, 7489-56 that none 376 doth return 7725-1 from his wickedness: 7451 they are all of them unto me as Sodom, 5467 and the inhabitants 3427-6 thereof as Gomorrah. 6017

23:15 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 concerning the prophets; 5030 Behold, I will feed 398-56 them with wormwood, 3939 and make them drink 8248-52 the water 4325 of gall: 7219 for from the prophets 5030 of Jerusalem 3389 is profaneness 2613 gone forth 3318-1 into all the land. 776

23:16 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 Hearken 8085-4 not unto the words 1697 of the prophets 5030 that prophesy 5012-12 unto you: they make you vain: 1891-56 they speak 1696-17 a vision 2377 of their own heart, 3820 [and] not out of the mouth 6310 of the LORD. 3068

23:17 They say 559-6 still 559-2 unto them that despise 5006-18 me, The LORD 3068 hath said, 1696-14 Ye shall have peace; 7965 and they say 559-1 unto every one that walketh 1980-6 after the imagination 8307 of his own heart, 3820 No evil 7451 shall come 935-4 upon you.

23:18 For who hath stood 5975-1 in the counsel 5475 of the LORD, 3068 and hath perceived 7200-4 and heard 8085-4 his word? 1697 who hath marked 7181-52 his word, 1697 and heard 8085-4 [it]?

23:19 Behold, a whirlwind 5591 of the LORD 3068 is gone forth 3318-1 in fury, 2534 even a grievous 2342-114 whirlwind: 5591 it shall fall grievously 2342-4 upon the head 7218 of the wicked. 7563

23:20 The anger 639 of the LORD 3068 shall not return, 7725-4 until he have executed, 6213-2 and till he have performed 6965-53 the thoughts 4209 of his heart: 3820 in the latter 319 days 3117 ye shall consider 995-113 it perfectly. 998

23:21 I have not sent 7971-1 these prophets, 5030 yet they ran: 7323-1 I have not spoken 1696-14 to them, yet they prophesied. 5012-8

23:22 But if they had stood 5975-1 in my counsel, 5475 and had caused my people 5971 to hear 8085-55 my words, 1697 then they should have turned 7725-55 them from their evil 7451 way, 1870 and from the evil 7455 of their doings. 4611

23:23 [Am] I a God 430 at hand, 7138 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 and not a God 430 afar off? 7350

23:24 Can any 376 hide 5641-11 himself in secret places 4565 that I shall not see 7200-4 him? saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068 Do not I fill 4392 heaven 8064 and earth? 776 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

23:25 I have heard 8085-1 what the prophets 5030 said, 559-1 that prophesy 5012-12 lies 8267 in my name, 8034 saying, 559-2 I have dreamed, 2492-1 I have dreamed. 2492-1

23:26 How long shall [this] be 3426 in the heart 3820 of the prophets 5030 that prophesy 5012-12 lies? 8267 yea, [they are] prophets 5030 of the deceit 8649 of their own heart; 3820

23:27 Which think 2803-6 to cause my people 5971 to forget 7911-53 my name 8034 by their dreams 2472 which they tell 5608-17 every man 376 to his neighbour, 7453 as their fathers 1 have forgotten 7911-1 my name 8034 for Baal. 1168

23:28 The prophet 5030 that hath a dream, 2472 let him tell 5608-17 a dream; 2472 and he that hath my word, 1697 let him speak 1696-17 my word 1697 faithfully. 571 What [is] the chaff 8401 to the wheat? 1250 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

23:29 [Is] not my word 1697 like 3541 as a fire? 784 saith 5002-7 the LORD; 3068 and like a hammer 6360 [that] breaketh the rock 5553 in pieces? 6327-34

23:30 Therefore, behold, I [am] against the prophets, 5030 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 that steal 1589-18 my words 1697 every one 376 from his neighbour. 7453

23:31 Behold, I [am] against the prophets, 5030 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 that use 3947-6 their tongues, 3956 and say, 5001-4 He saith. 5002-7

23:32 Behold, I [am] against them that prophesy 5012-12 false 8267 dreams, 2472 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 and do tell 5608-17 them, and cause my people 5971 to err 8582-55 by their lies, 8267 and by their lightness; 6350 yet I sent 7971-1 them not, nor commanded 6680-14 them: therefore they shall not profit 3276-55 this people 5971 at all, 3276-53 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

23:33 And when this people, 5971 or the prophet, 5030 or a priest, 3548 shall ask 7592-4 thee, saying, 559-2 What [is] the burden 4853 of the LORD? 3068 thou shalt then say 559-1 unto them, What burden? 4853 I will even forsake 5203-1 you, saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

23:34 And [as for] the prophet, 5030 and the priest, 3548 and the people, 5971 that shall say, 559-4 The burden 4853 of the LORD, 3068 I will even punish 6485-1 that man 376 and his house. 1004

23:35 Thus shall ye say 559-4 every one 376 to his neighbour, 7453 and every one 376 to his brother, 251 What hath the LORD 3068 answered? 6030-1 and, What hath the LORD 3068 spoken? 1696-14

23:36 And the burden 4853 of the LORD 3068 shall ye mention 2142-4 no more: for every man's 376 word 1697 shall be his burden; 4853 for ye have perverted 2015-1 the words 1697 of the living 2416 God, 430 of the LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 our God. 430

23:37 Thus shalt thou say 559-4 to the prophet, 5030 What hath the LORD 3068 answered 6030-1 thee? and, What hath the LORD 3068 spoken? 1696-14

23:38 But since 518 ye say, 559-4 The burden 4853 of the LORD; 3068 therefore thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 Because ye say 559-2 this word, 1697 The burden 4853 of the LORD, 3068 and I have sent 7971-4 unto you, saying, 559-2 Ye shall not say, 559-4 The burden 4853 of the LORD; 3068

23:39 Therefore, behold, I, even I, will utterly 5377-2 forget 5382-1 you, and I will forsake 5203-1 you, and the city 5892 that I gave 5414-1 you and your fathers, 1 [and cast you] out of my presence: 6440

23:40 And I will bring 5414-1 an everlasting 5769 reproach 2781 upon you, and a perpetual 5769 shame, 3640 which shall not be forgotten. 7911-11

24:1 The LORD 3068 shewed 7200-52 me, and, behold, two 8147 baskets 1736 of figs 8384 [were] set 3259-94 before 6440 the temple 1964 of the LORD, 3068 after 310 that Nebuchadrezzar 5019 king 4428 of Babylon 894 had carried away captive 1540-53 Jeconiah 3204 the son 1121 of Jehoiakim 3079 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 and the princes 8269 of Judah, 3063 with the carpenters 2796 and smiths, 4525 from Jerusalem, 3389 and had brought 935-55 them to Babylon. 894

24:2 One 259 basket 1731 [had] very 3966 good 2896 figs, 8384 [even] like the figs 8384 [that are] first ripe: 1073 and the other 259 basket 1731 [had] very 3966 naughty 7451 figs, 8384 which could not be eaten, 398-11 they were so bad. 7455

24:3 Then said 559-4 the LORD 3068 unto me, What seest 7200-6 thou, Jeremiah? 3414 And I said, 559-4 Figs; 8384 the good 2896 figs, 8384 very 3966 good; 2896 and the evil, 7451 very 3966 evil, 7451 that cannot be eaten, 398-11 they are so evil. 7455

24:4 Again the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto me, saying, 559-2

24:5 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 the God 430 of Israel; 3478 Like these good 2896 figs, 8384 so will I acknowledge 5234-55 them that are carried away captive 1546 of Judah, 3063 whom I have sent 7971-14 out of this place 4725 into the land 776 of the Chaldeans 3778 for [their] good. 2896

24:6 For I will set 7760-1 mine eyes 5869 upon them for good, 2896 and I will bring them again 7725-52 to this land: 776 and I will build 1129-1 them, and not pull [them] down; 2040-4 and I will plant 5193-1 them, and not pluck [them] up. 5428-4

24:7 And I will give 5414-1 them an heart 3820 to know 3045-2 me, that I [am] the LORD: 3068 and they shall be my people, 5971 and I will be their God: 430 for they shall return 7725-4 unto me with their whole heart. 3820

24:8 And as the evil 7451 figs, 8384 which cannot be eaten, 398-11 they are so evil; 7455 surely thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 So will I give 5414-4 Zedekiah 6667 the king 4428 of Judah, 3063 and his princes, 8269 and the residue 7611 of Jerusalem, 3389 that remain 7604-12 in this land, 776 and them that dwell 3427-6 in the land 776 of Egypt: 4714

24:9 And I will deliver 5414-1 them to be removed 2189|2113-k into all the kingdoms 4467 of the earth 776 for [their] hurt, 7451 [to be] a reproach 2781 and a proverb, 4912 a taunt 8148 and a curse, 7045 in all places 4725 whither I shall drive 5080-55 them.

24:10 And I will send 7971-14 the sword, 2719 the famine, 7458 and the pestilence, 1698 among them, till they be consumed 8552-2 from off the land 127 that I gave 5414-1 unto them and to their fathers. 1

25:1 The word 1697 that came to Jeremiah 3414 concerning all the people 5971 of Judah 3063 in the fourth 7243 year 8141 of Jehoiakim 3079 the son 1121 of Josiah 2977 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 that [was] the first 7224 year 8141 of Nebuchadrezzar 5019 king 4428 of Babylon; 894

25:2 The which Jeremiah 3414 the prophet 5030 spake 1696-14 unto all the people 5971 of Judah, 3063 and to all the inhabitants 3427-6 of Jerusalem, 3389 saying, 559-2

25:3 From the thirteenth 7969 6240 year 8141 of Josiah 2977 the son 1121 of Amon 526 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 even unto this day, 3117 that [is] the three 7969 and twentieth 6242 year, 8141 the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 hath come unto me, and I have spoken 1696-17 unto you, rising early 7925-53 and speaking; 1696-15 but ye have not hearkened. 8085-1

25:4 And the LORD 3068 hath sent 7971-1 unto you all his servants 5650 the prophets, 5030 rising early 7925-53 and sending 7971-2 [them]; but ye have not hearkened, 8085-1 nor inclined 5186-52 your ear 241 to hear. 8085-2

25:5 They said, 559-2 Turn ye again 7725-3 now every one 376 from his evil 7451 way, 1870 and from the evil 7455 of your doings, 4611 and dwell 3427-3 in the land 127 that the LORD 3068 hath given 5414-1 unto you and to your fathers 1 for 5704 ever 5769 and ever: 5769

25:6 And go 3212-4 not after 310 other 312 gods 430 to serve 5647-2 them, and to worship 7812-99 them, and provoke me not to anger 3707-55 with the works 4639 of your hands; 3027 and I will do you no hurt. 7489-55

25:7 Yet ye have not hearkened 8085-1 unto me, saith 5002-7 the LORD; 3068 that ye might provoke me to anger 3707-53 with the works 4639 of your hands 3027 to your own hurt. 7451

25:8 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts; 6635 Because ye have not heard 8085-1 my words, 1697

25:9 Behold, I will send 7971-6 and take 3947-1 all the families 4940 of the north, 6828 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 and Nebuchadrezzar 5019 the king 4428 of Babylon, 894 my servant, 5650 and will bring 935-52 them against this land, 776 and against the inhabitants 3427-6 thereof, and against all these nations 1471 round about, 5439 and will utterly destroy 2763-52 them, and make 7760-1 them an astonishment, 8047 and an hissing, 8322 and perpetual 5769 desolations. 2723

25:10 Moreover I will take 6-52 from them the voice 6963 of mirth, 8342 and the voice 6963 of gladness, 8057 the voice 6963 of the bridegroom, 2860 and the voice 6963 of the bride, 3618 the sound 6963 of the millstones, 7347 and the light 216 of the candle. 5216

25:11 And this whole land 776 shall be a desolation, 2723 [and] an astonishment; 8047 and these nations 1471 shall serve 5647-1 the king 4428 of Babylon 894 seventy 7657 years. 8141

25:12 And it shall come to pass, when seventy 7657 years 8141 are accomplished, 4390-2 [that] I will punish 6485-4 the king 4428 of Babylon, 894 and that nation, 1471 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 for their iniquity, 5771 and the land 776 of the Chaldeans, 3778 and will make 7760-1 it perpetual 5769 desolations. 8077

25:13 And I will bring 935-52 upon that land 776 all my words 1697 which I have pronounced 1696-14 against it, [even] all that is written 3789-7 in this book, 5612 which Jeremiah 3414 hath prophesied 5012-8 against all the nations. 1471

25:14 For many 7227 nations 1471 and great 1419 kings 4428 shall serve 5647-1 themselves of them also: and I will recompense 7999-14 them according to their deeds, 6467 and according to the works 4639 of their own hands. 3027

25:15 For thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel 3478 unto me; Take 3947-3 the wine 3196 cup 3563 of this fury 2534 at my hand, 3027 and cause all the nations, 1471 to whom I send 7971-6 thee, to drink 8248-52 it.

25:16 And they shall drink, 8354-1 and be moved, 1607-105 and be mad, 1984-107 because 6440 of the sword 2719 that I will send 7971-6 among them.

25:17 Then took 3947-4 I the cup 3563 at the LORD'S 3068 hand, 3027 and made all the nations 1471 to drink, 8248-55 unto whom the LORD 3068 had sent 7971-1 me:

25:18 [To wit], Jerusalem, 3389 and the cities 5892 of Judah, 3063 and the kings 4428 thereof, and the princes 8269 thereof, to make 5414-2 them a desolation, 2723 an astonishment, 8047 an hissing, 8322 and a curse; 7045 as [it is] this day; 3117

25:19 Pharaoh 6547 king 4428 of Egypt, 4714 and his servants, 5650 and his princes, 8269 and all his people; 5971

25:20 And all the mingled people, 6153 and all the kings 4428 of the land 776 of Uz, 5780 and all the kings 4428 of the land 776 of the Philistines, 6430 and Ashkelon, 831 and Azzah, 5804 and Ekron, 6138 and the remnant 7611 of Ashdod, 795

25:21 Edom, 123 and Moab, 4124 and the children 1121 of Ammon, 5983

25:22 And all the kings 4428 of Tyrus, 6865 and all the kings 4428 of Zidon, 6721 and the kings 4428 of the isles 339 which [are] beyond 5676 the sea, 3220

25:23 Dedan, 1719 and Tema, 8485 and Buz, 938 and all [that are] in the utmost 7112-7 corners, 6285

25:24 And all the kings 4428 of Arabia, 6152 and all the kings 4428 of the mingled people 6153 that dwell 7931-6 in the desert, 4057

25:25 And all the kings 4428 of Zimri, 2174 and all the kings 4428 of Elam, 5867 and all the kings 4428 of the Medes, 4074

25:26 And all the kings 4428 of the north, 6828 far 7350 and near, 7138 one 376 with another, 251 and all the kingdoms 4467 of the world, 776 which [are] upon the face 6440 of the earth: 127 and the king 4428 of Sheshach 8347 shall drink 8354-4 after 310 them.

25:27 Therefore thou shalt say 559-1 unto them, Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 the God 430 of Israel; 3478 Drink 8354-3 ye, and be drunken, 7937-3 and spue, 7006-3 and fall, 5307-3 and rise 6965-4 no more, because 6440 of the sword 2719 which I will send 7971-6 among you.

25:28 And it shall be, if they refuse 3985-17 to take 3947-2 the cup 3563 at thine hand 3027 to drink, 8354-2 then shalt thou say 559-1 unto them, Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts; 6635 Ye shall certainly 8354-2 drink. 8354-4

25:29 For, lo, I begin 2490-56 to bring evil 7489-53 on the city 5892 which is called 7121-8 by my name, 8034 and should ye be utterly 5352-9 unpunished? 5352-11 Ye shall not be unpunished: 5352-11 for I will call 7121-6 for a sword 2719 upon all the inhabitants 3427-6 of the earth, 776 saith 5002-7 the LORD 3068 of hosts. 6635

25:30 Therefore prophesy 5012-11 thou against them all these words, 1697 and say 559-1 unto them, The LORD 3068 shall roar 7580-4 from on high, 4791 and utter 5414-4 his voice 6963 from his holy 6944 habitation; 4583 he shall mightily 7580-2 roar 7580-4 upon his habitation; 5116 he shall give 6030-4 a shout, 1959 as they that tread 1869-6 [the grapes], against all the inhabitants 3427-6 of the earth. 776

25:31 A noise 7588 shall come 935-1 [even] to the ends 7097 of the earth; 776 for the LORD 3068 hath a controversy 7379 with the nations, 1471 he will plead 8199-12 with all flesh; 1320 he will give 5414-1 them [that are] wicked 7563 to the sword, 2719 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

25:32 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 Behold, evil 7451 shall go forth 3318-6 from nation 1471 to nation, 1471 and a great 1419 whirlwind 5591 shall be raised up 5782-11 from the coasts 3411 of the earth. 776

25:33 And the slain 2491 of the LORD 3068 shall be at that day 3117 from [one] end 7097 of the earth 776 even unto the [other] end 7097 of the earth: 776 they shall not be lamented, 5594-11 neither gathered, 622-11 nor buried; 6912-11 they shall be dung 1828 upon 6440 the ground. 127

25:34 Howl, 3213-54 ye shepherds, 7462-6 and cry; 2199-3 and wallow 6428-100 yourselves [in the ashes], ye principal 117 of the flock: 6629 for the days 3117 of your slaughter 2873-2 and of your dispersions 8600 are accomplished; 4390-1 and ye shall fall 5307-1 like a pleasant 2532 vessel. 3627

25:35 And the shepherds 7462-6 shall have no way 6-1 to flee, 4498 nor the principal 117 of the flock 6629 to escape. 6413

25:36 A voice 6963 of the cry 6818 of the shepherds, 7462-6 and an howling 3215 of the principal 117 of the flock, 6629 [shall be heard]: for the LORD 3068 hath spoiled 7703-6 their pasture. 4830

25:37 And the peaceable 7965 habitations 4999 are cut down 1826-8 because 6440 of the fierce 2740 anger 639 of the LORD. 3068

25:38 He hath forsaken 5800-1 his covert, 5520 as the lion: 3715 for their land 776 is desolate 8047 because 6440 of the fierceness 2740 of the oppressor, 3238-6 and because 6440 of his fierce 2740 anger. 639

26:1 In the beginning 7225 of the reign 4468 of Jehoiakim 3079 the son 1121 of Josiah 2977 king 4428 of Judah 3063 came this word 1697 from the LORD, 3068 saying, 559-2

26:2 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 Stand 5975-3 in the court 2691 of the LORD'S 3068 house, 1004 and speak 1696-14 unto all the cities 5892 of Judah, 3063 which come 935-6 to worship 7812-99 in the LORD'S 3068 house, 1004 all the words 1697 that I command 6680-14 thee to speak 1696-15 unto them; diminish 1639-4 not a word: 1697

26:3 If so be they will hearken, 8085-4 and turn 7725-4 every man 376 from his evil 7451 way, 1870 that I may repent 5162-8 me of the evil, 7451 which I purpose 2803-6 to do 6213-2 unto them because 6440 of the evil 7455 of their doings. 4611

26:4 And thou shalt say 559-1 unto them, Thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 If ye will not hearken 8085-4 to me, to walk 3212-2 in my law, 8451 which I have set 5414-1 before 6440 you,

26:5 To hearken 8085-2 to the words 1697 of my servants 5650 the prophets, 5030 whom I sent 7971-6 unto you, both rising up early, 7925-53 and sending 7971-2 [them], but ye have not hearkened; 8085-1

26:6 Then will I make 5414-1 this house 1004 like Shiloh, 7887 and will make 5414-4 this city 5892 a curse 7045 to all the nations 1471 of the earth. 776

26:7 So the priests 3548 and the prophets 5030 and all the people 5971 heard 8085-4 Jeremiah 3414 speaking 1696-18 these words 1697 in the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068

26:8 Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah 3414 had made an end 3615-15 of speaking 1696-15 all that the LORD 3068 had commanded 6680-14 [him] to speak 1696-15 unto all the people, 5971 that the priests 3548 and the prophets 5030 and all the people 5971 took 8610-4 him, saying, 559-2 Thou shalt surely 4191-2 die. 4191-4

26:9 Why hast thou prophesied 5012-8 in the name 8034 of the LORD, 3068 saying, 559-2 This house 1004 shall be like Shiloh, 7887 and this city 5892 shall be desolate 2717-4 without an inhabitant? 3427-6 And all the people 5971 were gathered 6950-11 against Jeremiah 3414 in the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068

26:10 When the princes 8269 of Judah 3063 heard 8085-4 these things, 1697 then they came up 5927-4 from the king's 4428 house 1004 unto the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and sat down 3427-4 in the entry 6607 of the new 2319 gate 8179 of the LORD'S 3068 [house].

26:11 Then spake 559-4 the priests 3548 and the prophets 5030 unto the princes 8269 and to all the people, 5971 saying, 559-2 This man 376 [is] worthy 4941 to die; 4194 for he hath prophesied 5012-8 against this city, 5892 as ye have heard 8085-1 with your ears. 241

26:12 Then spake 559-4 Jeremiah 3414 unto all the princes 8269 and to all the people, 5971 saying, 559-2 The LORD 3068 sent 7971-1 me to prophesy 5012-9 against this house 1004 and against this city 5892 all the words 1697 that ye have heard. 8085-1

26:13 Therefore now amend 3190-54 your ways 1870 and your doings, 4611 and obey 8085-3 the voice 6963 of the LORD 3068 your God; 430 and the LORD 3068 will repent 5162-11 him of the evil 7451 that he hath pronounced 1696-14 against you.

26:14 As for me, behold, I [am] in your hand: 3027 do 6213-3 with me as seemeth 5869 good 2896 and meet 3477 unto you.

26:15 But know 3045-4 ye for certain, 3045-2 that if ye put me to death, 4191-56 ye shall surely bring 5414-6 innocent 5355 blood 1818 upon yourselves, and upon this city, 5892 and upon the inhabitants 3427-6 thereof: for of a truth 571 the LORD 3068 hath sent 7971-1 me unto you to speak 1696-15 all these words 1697 in your ears. 241

26:16 Then said 559-4 the princes 8269 and all the people 5971 unto the priests 3548 and to the prophets; 5030 This man 376 [is] not worthy 4941 to die: 4194 for he hath spoken 1696-14 to us in the name 8034 of the LORD 3068 our God. 430

26:17 Then rose up 6965-4 certain 582 of the elders 2205 of the land, 776 and spake 559-4 to all the assembly 6951 of the people, 5971 saying, 559-2

26:18 Micah 4318|4320-q the Morasthite 4183 prophesied 5012-12 in the days 3117 of Hezekiah 2396 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 and spake 559-4 to all the people 5971 of Judah, 3063 saying, 559-2 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts; 6635 Zion 6726 shall be plowed 2790-11 [like] a field, 7704 and Jerusalem 3389 shall become heaps, 5856 and the mountain 2022 of the house 1004 as the high places 1116 of a forest. 3293

26:19 Did Hezekiah 2396 king 4428 of Judah 3063 and all Judah 3063 put him at all 4191-53 to death? 4191-52 did he not fear 3373 the LORD, 3068 and besought 2470-17 6440 the LORD, 3068 and the LORD 3068 repented 5162-11 him of the evil 7451 which he had pronounced 1696-14 against them? Thus might we 587 procure 6213-6 great 1419 evil 7451 against our souls. 5315

26:20 And there was also a man 376 that prophesied 5012-102 in the name 8034 of the LORD, 3068 Urijah 223 the son 1121 of Shemaiah 8098 of Kirjathjearim, 7157 who prophesied 5012-11 against this city 5892 and against this land 776 according to all the words 1697 of Jeremiah: 3414

26:21 And when Jehoiakim 3079 the king, 4428 with all his mighty men, 1368 and all the princes, 8269 heard 8085-4 his words, 1697 the king 4428 sought 1245-17 to put him to death: 4191-53 but when Urijah 223 heard 8085-4 it, he was afraid, 3372-4 and fled, 1272-4 and went 935-4 into Egypt; 4714

26:22 And Jehoiakim 3079 the king 4428 sent 7971-4 men 582 into Egypt, 4714 [namely], Elnathan 494 the son 1121 of Achbor, 5907 and [certain] men 582 with him into Egypt. 4714

26:23 And they fetched forth 3318-55 Urijah 223 out of Egypt, 4714 and brought 935-55 him unto Jehoiakim 3079 the king; 4428 who slew 5221-55 him with the sword, 2719 and cast 7993-55 his dead body 5038 into the graves 6913 of the common 1121 people. 5971

26:24 Nevertheless the hand 3027 of Ahikam 296 the son 1121 of Shaphan 8227 was with Jeremiah, 3414 that they should not give 5414-2 him into the hand 3027 of the people 5971 to put him to death. 4191-53

27:1 In the beginning 7225 of the reign 4467 of Jehoiakim 3079 the son 1121 of Josiah 2977 king 4428 of Judah 3063 came this word 1697 unto Jeremiah 3414 from the LORD, 3068 saying, 559-2

27:2 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 to me; Make 6213-3 thee bonds 4147 and yokes, 4133 and put 5414-1 them upon thy neck, 6677

27:3 And send 7971-14 them to the king 4428 of Edom, 123 and to the king 4428 of Moab, 4124 and to the king 4428 of the Ammonites, 1121 5983 and to the king 4428 of Tyrus, 6865 and to the king 4428 of Zidon, 6721 by the hand 3027 of the messengers 4397 which come 935-6 to Jerusalem 3389 unto Zedekiah 6667 king 4428 of Judah; 3063

27:4 And command 6680-14 them to say 559-2 unto their masters, 113 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 the God 430 of Israel; 3478 Thus shall ye say 559-4 unto your masters; 113

27:5 I have made 6213-1 the earth, 776 the man 120 and the beast 929 that [are] upon 6440 the ground, 776 by my great 1419 power 3581 and by my outstretched 5186-7 arm, 2220 and have given 5414-1 it unto whom it seemed 5869 meet 3474-1 unto me.

27:6 And now have I given 5414-1 all these lands 776 into the hand 3027 of Nebuchadnezzar 5019 the king 4428 of Babylon, 894 my servant; 5650 and the beasts 2416 of the field 7704 have I given 5414-1 him also to serve 5647-2 him.

27:7 And all nations 1471 shall serve 5647-1 him, and his son, 1121 and his son's 1121 son, 1121 until the very time 6256 of his land 776 come: 935-2 and then many 7227 nations 1471 and great 1419 kings 4428 shall serve 5647-1 themselves of him.

27:8 And it shall come to pass, [that] the nation 1471 and kingdom 4467 which will not serve 5647-4 the same Nebuchadnezzar 5019 the king 4428 of Babylon, 894 and that will not put 5414-4 their neck 6677 under the yoke 5923 of the king 4428 of Babylon, 894 that nation 1471 will I punish, 6485-4 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 with the sword, 2719 and with the famine, 7458 and with the pestilence, 1698 until I have consumed 8552-2 them by his hand. 3027

27:9 Therefore hearken 8085-4 not ye to your prophets, 5030 nor to your diviners, 7080-6 nor to your dreamers, 2472 nor to your enchanters, 6049-26 nor to your sorcerers, 3786 which speak 559-6 unto you, saying, 559-2 Ye shall not serve 5647-4 the king 4428 of Babylon: 894

27:10 For they prophesy 5012-12 a lie 8267 unto you, to remove you far 7368-53 from your land; 127 and that I should drive you out, 5080-52 and ye should perish. 6-1

27:11 But the nations 1471 that bring 935-55 their neck 6677 under the yoke 5923 of the king 4428 of Babylon, 894 and serve 5647-1 him, those will I let remain 3240-52 still in their own land, 127 saith 5002-7 the LORD; 3068 and they shall till 5647-1 it, and dwell 3427-1 therein.

27:12 I spake 1696-14 also to Zedekiah 6667 king 4428 of Judah 3063 according to all these words, 1697 saying, 559-2 Bring 935-54 your necks 6677 under the yoke 5923 of the king 4428 of Babylon, 894 and serve 5647-3 him and his people, 5971 and live. 2421-3

27:13 Why will ye die, 4191-4 thou and thy people, 5971 by the sword, 2719 by the famine, 7458 and by the pestilence, 1698 as the LORD 3068 hath spoken 1696-14 against the nation 1471 that will not serve 5647-4 the king 4428 of Babylon? 894

27:14 Therefore hearken 8085-4 not unto the words 1697 of the prophets 5030 that speak 559-6 unto you, saying, 559-2 Ye shall not serve 5647-4 the king 4428 of Babylon: 894 for they prophesy 5012-12 a lie 8267 unto you.

27:15 For I have not sent 7971-1 them, saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 yet they prophesy 5012-12 a lie 8267 in my name; 8034 that I might drive you out, 5080-53 and that ye might perish, 6-1 ye, and the prophets 5030 that prophesy 5012-12 unto you.

27:16 Also I spake 1696-14 to the priests 3548 and to all this people, 5971 saying, 559-2 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 Hearken 8085-4 not to the words 1697 of your prophets 5030 that prophesy 5012-12 unto you, saying, 559-2 Behold, the vessels 3627 of the LORD'S 3068 house 1004 shall now shortly 4120 be brought again 7725-94 from Babylon: 894 for they prophesy 5012-12 a lie 8267 unto you.

27:17 Hearken 8085-4 not unto them; serve 5647-3 the king 4428 of Babylon, 894 and live: 2421-3 wherefore should this city 5892 be laid waste? 2723

27:18 But if they [be] prophets, 5030 and if the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 be 3426 with them, let them now make intercession 6293-4 to the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 that the vessels 3627 which are left 3498-12 in the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and [in] the house 1004 of the king 4428 of Judah, 3063 and at Jerusalem, 3389 go 935-1 not to Babylon. 894

27:19 For thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 concerning the pillars, 5982 and concerning the sea, 3220 and concerning the bases, 4350 and concerning the residue 3499 of the vessels 3627 that remain 3498-12 in this city, 5892

27:20 Which Nebuchadnezzar 5019 king 4428 of Babylon 894 took 3947-1 not, when he carried away captive 1540-53 Jeconiah 3204 the son 1121 of Jehoiakim 3079 king 4428 of Judah 3063 from Jerusalem 3389 to Babylon, 894 and all the nobles 2715 of Judah 3063 and Jerusalem; 3389

27:21 Yea, thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 the God 430 of Israel, 3478 concerning the vessels 3627 that remain 3498-12 [in] the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and [in] the house 1004 of the king 4428 of Judah 3063 and of Jerusalem; 3389

27:22 They shall be carried 935-93 to Babylon, 894 and there shall they be until the day 3117 that I visit 6485-2 them, saith 5002-7 the LORD; 3068 then will I bring them up, 5927-52 and restore 7725-52 them to this place. 4725

28:1 And it came to pass the same year, 8141 in the beginning 7225 of the reign 4467 of Zedekiah 6667 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 in the fourth 7243 year, 8141 [and] in the fifth 2549 month, 2320 [that] Hananiah 2608 the son 1121 of Azur 5809 the prophet, 5030 which [was] of Gibeon, 1391 spake 559-1 unto me in the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 in the presence 5869 of the priests 3548 and of all the people, 5971 saying, 559-2

28:2 Thus speaketh 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 the God 430 of Israel, 3478 saying, 559-2 I have broken 7665-1 the yoke 5923 of the king 4428 of Babylon. 894

28:3 Within two full years 8141 3117 will I bring again 7725-56 into this place 4725 all the vessels 3627 of the LORD'S 3068 house, 1004 that Nebuchadnezzar 5019 king 4428 of Babylon 894 took away 3947-1 from this place, 4725 and carried 935-55 them to Babylon: 894

28:4 And I will bring again 7725-56 to this place 4725 Jeconiah 3204 the son 1121 of Jehoiakim 3079 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 with all the captives 1546 of Judah, 3063 that went 935-6 into Babylon, 894 saith 5002-7 the LORD: 3068 for I will break 7665-4 the yoke 5923 of the king 4428 of Babylon. 894

28:5 Then the prophet 5030 Jeremiah 3414 said 559-4 unto the prophet 5030 Hananiah 2608 in the presence 5869 of the priests, 3548 and in the presence 5869 of all the people 5971 that stood 5975-6 in the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068

28:6 Even the prophet 5030 Jeremiah 3414 said, 559-4 Amen: 543 the LORD 3068 do 6213-4 so: the LORD 3068 perform 6965-55 thy words 1697 which thou hast prophesied, 5012-8 to bring again 7725-53 the vessels 3627 of the LORD'S 3068 house, 1004 and all that is carried away captive, 1473 from Babylon 894 into this place. 4725

28:7 Nevertheless hear 8085-3 thou now this word 1697 that I speak 1696-6 in thine ears, 241 and in the ears 241 of all the people; 5971

28:8 The prophets 5030 that have been before 6440 me and before 6440 thee of old 5769 prophesied 5012-11 both against many 7227 countries, 776 and against great 1419 kingdoms, 4467 of war, 4421 and of evil, 7451 and of pestilence. 1698

28:9 The prophet 5030 which prophesieth 5012-11 of peace, 7965 when the word 1697 of the prophet 5030 shall come to pass, 935-2 [then] 227 shall the prophet 5030 be known, 3045-11 that the LORD 3068 hath truly 571 sent 7971-1 him.

28:10 Then Hananiah 2608 the prophet 5030 took 3947-4 the yoke 4133 from off the prophet 5030 Jeremiah's 3414 neck, 6677 and brake 7665-4 it.

28:11 And Hananiah 2608 spake 559-4 in the presence 5869 of all the people, 5971 saying, 559-2 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 Even so will I break 7665-4 the yoke 5923 of Nebuchadnezzar 5019 king 4428 of Babylon 894 from the neck 6677 of all nations 1471 within the space of two full years. 8141 3117 And the prophet 5030 Jeremiah 3414 went 3212-4 his way. 1870

28:12 Then the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto Jeremiah 3414 [the prophet], after 310 that Hananiah 2608 the prophet 5030 had broken 7665-2 the yoke 4133 from off the neck 6677 of the prophet 5030 Jeremiah, 3414 saying, 559-2

28:13 Go 1980-2 and tell 559-1 Hananiah, 2608 saying, 559-2 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 Thou hast broken 7665-1 the yokes 4133 of wood; 6086 but thou shalt make 6213-1 for them yokes 4133 of iron. 1270

28:14 For thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 the God 430 of Israel; 3478 I have put 5414-1 a yoke 5923 of iron 1270 upon the neck 6677 of all these nations, 1471 that they may serve 5647-2 Nebuchadnezzar 5019 king 4428 of Babylon; 894 and they shall serve 5647-1 him: and I have given 5414-1 him the beasts 2416 of the field 7704 also.

28:15 Then said 559-4 the prophet 5030 Jeremiah 3414 unto Hananiah 2608 the prophet, 5030 Hear 8085-3 now, Hananiah; 2608 The LORD 3068 hath not sent 7971-1 thee; but thou makest this people 5971 to trust 982-52 in a lie. 8267

28:16 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 Behold, I will cast 7971-18 thee from off the face 6440 of the earth: 127 this year 8141 thou shalt die, 4191-5 because thou hast taught 1696-14 rebellion 5627 against the LORD. 3068

28:17 So Hananiah 2608 the prophet 5030 died 4191-4 the same year 8141 in the seventh 7637 month. 2320

29:1 Now these [are] the words 1697 of the letter 5612 that Jeremiah 3414 the prophet 5030 sent 7971-1 from Jerusalem 3389 unto the residue 3499 of the elders 2205 which were carried away captives, 1473 and to the priests, 3548 and to the prophets, 5030 and to all the people 5971 whom Nebuchadnezzar 5019 had carried away 1540-52 captive from Jerusalem 3389 to Babylon; 894

29:2 (After 310 that Jeconiah 3204 the king, 4428 and the queen, 1377 and the eunuchs, 5631 the princes 8269 of Judah 3063 and Jerusalem, 3389 and the carpenters, 2796 and the smiths, 4525 were departed 3318-2 from Jerusalem;) 3389

29:3 By the hand 3027 of Elasah 501 the son 1121 of Shaphan, 8227 and Gemariah 1587 the son 1121 of Hilkiah, 2518 (whom Zedekiah 6667 king 4428 of Judah 3063 sent 7971-1 unto Babylon 894 to Nebuchadnezzar 5019 king 4428 of Babylon) 894 saying, 559-2

29:4 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 the God 430 of Israel, 3478 unto all that are carried away captives, 1473 whom I have caused to be carried away 1540-52 from Jerusalem 3389 unto Babylon; 894

29:5 Build 1129-3 ye houses, 1004 and dwell 3427-3 [in them]; and plant 5193-3 gardens, 1593 and eat 398-3 the fruit 6529 of them;

29:6 Take 3947-3 ye wives, 802 and beget 3205-54 sons 1121 and daughters; 1323 and take 3947-3 wives 802 for your sons, 1121 and give 5414-3 your daughters 1323 to husbands, 582 that they may bear 3205-4 sons 1121 and daughters; 1323 that ye may be increased 7235-3 there, and not diminished. 4591-4

29:7 And seek 1875-3 the peace 7965 of the city 5892 whither I have caused you to be carried away captives, 1540-52 and pray 6419-100 unto the LORD 3068 for it: for in the peace 7965 thereof shall ye have peace. 7965

29:8 For thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 the God 430 of Israel; 3478 Let not your prophets 5030 and your diviners, 7080-6 that [be] in the midst 7130 of you, deceive 5377-55 you, neither hearken 8085-4 to your dreams 2472 which ye cause to be dreamed. 2492-56

29:9 For they prophesy 5012-12 falsely 8267 unto you in my name: 8034 I have not sent 7971-1 them, saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

29:10 For thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 That after 6310 seventy 7657 years 8141 be accomplished 4390-2 at Babylon 894 I will visit 6485-4 you, and perform 6965-52 my good 2896 word 1697 toward you, in causing you to return 7725-53 to this place. 4725

29:11 For I know 3045-1 the thoughts 4284 that I think 2803-6 toward you, saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 thoughts 4284 of peace, 7965 and not of evil, 7451 to give 5414-2 you an expected 8615 end. 319

29:12 Then shall ye call 7121-1 upon me, and ye shall go 1980-1 and pray 6419-98 unto me, and I will hearken 8085-1 unto you.

29:13 And ye shall seek 1245-14 me, and find 4672-1 [me], when ye shall search 1875-4 for me with all your heart. 3824

29:14 And I will be found 4672-8 of you, saith 5002-7 the LORD: 3068 and I will turn away 7725-1 your captivity, 7622|7622-k and I will gather 6908-14 you from all the nations, 1471 and from all the places 4725 whither I have driven 5080-52 you, saith 5002-7 the LORD; 3068 and I will bring you again 7725-52 into the place 4725 whence I caused you to be carried away captive. 1540-52

29:15 Because ye have said, 559-1 The LORD 3068 hath raised us up 6965-52 prophets 5030 in Babylon; 894

29:16 [Know] that thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of the king 4428 that sitteth 3427-6 upon the throne 3678 of David, 1732 and of all the people 5971 that dwelleth 3427-6 in this city, 5892 [and] of your brethren 251 that are not gone forth 3318-1 with you into captivity; 1473

29:17 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts; 6635 Behold, I will send 7971-18 upon them the sword, 2719 the famine, 7458 and the pestilence, 1698 and will make 5414-1 them like vile 8182 figs, 8384 that cannot be eaten, 398-11 they are so evil. 7455

29:18 And I will persecute 7291-1 310 them with the sword, 2719 with the famine, 7458 and with the pestilence, 1698 and will deliver 5414-1 them to be removed 2189|2113-k to all the kingdoms 4467 of the earth, 776 to be a curse, 423 and an astonishment, 8047 and an hissing, 8322 and a reproach, 2781 among all the nations 1471 whither I have driven 5080-52 them:

29:19 Because they have not hearkened 8085-1 to my words, 1697 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 which I sent 7971-1 unto them by my servants 5650 the prophets, 5030 rising up early 7925-53 and sending 7971-2 [them]; but ye would not hear, 8085-1 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

29:20 Hear 8085-3 ye therefore the word 1697 of the LORD, 3068 all ye of the captivity, 1473 whom I have sent 7971-14 from Jerusalem 3389 to Babylon: 894

29:21 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 the God 430 of Israel, 3478 of Ahab 256 the son 1121 of Kolaiah, 6964 and of Zedekiah 6667 the son 1121 of Maaseiah, 4641 which prophesy 5012-12 a lie 8267 unto you in my name; 8034 Behold, I will deliver 5414-6 them into the hand 3027 of Nebuchadrezzar 5019 king 4428 of Babylon; 894 and he shall slay 5221-52 them before your eyes; 5869

29:22 And of them shall be taken up 3947-27 a curse 7045 by all the captivity 1546 of Judah 3063 which [are] in Babylon, 894 saying, 559-2 The LORD 3068 make 7760-4 thee like Zedekiah 6667 and like Ahab, 256 whom the king 4428 of Babylon 894 roasted 7033-1 in the fire; 784

29:23 Because they have committed 6213-1 villany 5039 in Israel, 3478 and have committed adultery 5003-17 with their neighbours' 7453 wives, 802 and have spoken 1696-17 lying 8267 words 1697 in my name, 8034 which I have not commanded 6680-14 them; even I know, 3045-6 and [am] a witness, 5707 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

29:24 [Thus] shalt thou also speak 559-4 to Shemaiah 8098 the Nehelamite, 5161 saying, 559-2

29:25 Thus speaketh 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 the God 430 of Israel, 3478 saying, 559-2 Because thou hast sent 7971-1 letters 5612 in thy name 8034 unto all the people 5971 that [are] at Jerusalem, 3389 and to Zephaniah 6846 the son 1121 of Maaseiah 4641 the priest, 3548 and to all the priests, 3548 saying, 559-2

29:26 The LORD 3068 hath made 5414-1 thee priest 3548 in the stead of Jehoiada 3077 the priest, 3548 that ye should be officers 6496 in the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 for every man 376 [that is] mad, 7696-30 and maketh himself a prophet, 5012-102 that thou shouldest put 5414-1 him in prison, 4115 and in the stocks. 6729

29:27 Now therefore why hast thou not reproved 1605-1 Jeremiah 3414 of Anathoth, 6069 which maketh himself a prophet 5012-102 to you?

29:28 For therefore he sent 7971-1 unto us [in] Babylon, 894 saying, 559-2 This 1931 [captivity is] long: 752 build 1129-3 ye houses, 1004 and dwell 3427-3 [in them]; and plant 5193-3 gardens, 1593 and eat 398-3 the fruit 6529 of them.

29:29 And Zephaniah 6846 the priest 3548 read 7121-4 this letter 5612 in the ears 241 of Jeremiah 3414 the prophet. 5030

29:30 Then came the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 unto Jeremiah, 3414 saying, 559-2

29:31 Send 7971-3 to all them of the captivity, 1473 saying, 559-2 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 concerning Shemaiah 8098 the Nehelamite; 5161 Because that Shemaiah 8098 hath prophesied 5012-8 unto you, and I sent 7971-1 him not, and he caused you to trust 982-55 in a lie: 8267

29:32 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 Behold, I will punish 6485-6 Shemaiah 8098 the Nehelamite, 5161 and his seed: 2233 he shall not have a man 376 to dwell 3427-6 among 8432 this people; 5971 neither shall he behold 7200-4 the good 2896 that I will do 6213-6 for my people, 5971 saith 5002-7 the LORD; 3068 because he hath taught 1696-14 rebellion 5627 against the LORD. 3068

30:1 The word 1697 that came to Jeremiah 3414 from the LORD, 3068 saying, 559-2

30:2 Thus speaketh 559-1 the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel, 3478 saying, 559-2 Write 3789-3 thee all the words 1697 that I have spoken 1696-14 unto thee in a book. 5612

30:3 For, lo, the days 3117 come, 935-6 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 that I will bring again 7725-1 the captivity 7622 of my people 5971 Israel 3478 and Judah, 3063 saith 559-1 the LORD: 3068 and I will cause them to return 7725-52 to the land 776 that I gave 5414-1 to their fathers, 1 and they shall possess 3423-1 it.

30:4 And these [are] the words 1697 that the LORD 3068 spake 1696-14 concerning Israel 3478 and concerning Judah. 3063

30:5 For thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 We have heard 8085-1 a voice 6963 of trembling, 2731 of fear, 6343 and not of peace. 7965

30:6 Ask 7592-3 ye now, and see 7200-3 whether a man 2145 doth travail with child? 3205-6 wherefore do I see 7200-1 every man 1397 with his hands 3027 on his loins, 2504 as a woman in travail, 3205-6 and all faces 6440 are turned 2015-8 into paleness? 3420

30:7 Alas! 1945 for that day 3117 [is] great, 1419 so that none 369 [is] like it: it [is] even the time 6256 of Jacob's 3290 trouble; 6869 but he shall be saved 3467-11 out of it.

30:8 For it shall come to pass in that day, 3117 saith 5002-7 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 [that] I will break 7665-4 his yoke 5923 from off thy neck, 6677 and will burst 5423-17 thy bonds, 4147 and strangers 2114-5 shall no more serve 5647-4 themselves of him:

30:9 But they shall serve 5647-1 the LORD 3068 their God, 430 and David 1732 their king, 4428 whom I will raise up 6965-55 unto them.

30:10 Therefore fear 3372-4 thou not, O my servant 5650 Jacob, 3290 saith 5002-7 the LORD; 3068 neither be dismayed, 2865-11 O Israel: 3478 for, lo, I will save 3467-56 thee from afar, 7350 and thy seed 2233 from the land 776 of their captivity; 7628 and Jacob 3290 shall return, 7725-1 and shall be in rest, 8252-1 and be quiet, 7599-40 and none shall make [him] afraid. 2729-56

30:11 For I [am] with thee, saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 to save 3467-53 thee: though I make 6213-4 a full end 3617 of all nations 1471 whither I have scattered 6327-52 thee, yet will I not make 6213-4 a full end 3617 of thee: but I will correct 3256-14 thee in measure, 4941 and will not leave thee altogether 5352-15 unpunished. 5352-17

30:12 For thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Thy bruise 7667 [is] incurable, 605-7 [and] thy wound 4347 [is] grievous. 2470-12

30:13 [There is] none to plead 1777-6 thy cause, 1779 that thou mayest be bound up: 4205 thou hast no healing 8585 medicines. 7499

30:14 All thy lovers 157-18 have forgotten 7911-1 thee; they seek 1875-4 thee not; for I have wounded 5221-52 thee with the wound 4347 of an enemy, 341-6 with the chastisement 4148 of a cruel one, 394 for the multitude 7230 of thine iniquity; 5771 [because] thy sins 2403 were increased. 6105-1

30:15 Why criest 2199-4 thou for thine affliction? 7667 thy sorrow 4341 [is] incurable 605-7 for the multitude 7230 of thine iniquity: 5771 [because] thy sins 2403 were increased, 6105-1 I have done 6213-1 these things unto thee.

30:16 Therefore all they that devour 398-6 thee shall be devoured; 398-11 and all thine adversaries, 6862 every one of them, shall go 3212-4 into captivity; 7628 and they that spoil 7601-6|8154-6-k thee shall be a spoil, 4933 and all that prey 962-6 upon thee will I give 5414-4 for a prey. 957

30:17 For I will restore 5927-55 health 724 unto thee, and I will heal 7495-4 thee of thy wounds, 4347 saith 5002-7 the LORD; 3068 because they called 7121-1 thee an Outcast, 5080-12 [saying], This [is] Zion, 6726 whom no man seeketh after. 1875-6

30:18 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 Behold, I will bring again 7725-6 the captivity 7622 of Jacob's 3290 tents, 168 and have mercy 7355-17 on his dwellingplaces; 4908 and the city 5892 shall be builded 1129-8 upon her own heap, 8510 and the palace 759 shall remain 3427-4 after the manner 4941 thereof.

30:19 And out of them shall proceed 3318-1 thanksgiving 8426 and the voice 6963 of them that make merry: 7832-18 and I will multiply 7235-52 them, and they shall not be few; 4591-4 I will also glorify 3513-52 them, and they shall not be small. 6819-4

30:20 Their children 1121 also shall be as aforetime, 6924 and their congregation 5712 shall be established 3559-11 before 6440 me, and I will punish 6485-1 all that oppress 3905-5 them.

30:21 And their nobles 117 shall be of themselves, and their governor 4910-6 shall proceed 3318-4 from the midst 7130 of them; and I will cause him to draw near, 7126-52 and he shall approach 5066-8 unto me: for who [is] this that engaged 6148-1 his heart 3820 to approach 5066-2 unto me? saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

30:22 And ye shall be my people, 5971 and I will be your God. 430

30:23 Behold, the whirlwind 5591 of the LORD 3068 goeth forth 3318-1 with fury, 2534 a continuing 1641-109 whirlwind: 5591 it shall fall with pain 2342-4 upon the head 7218 of the wicked. 7563

30:24 The fierce 2740 anger 639 of the LORD 3068 shall not return, 7725-4 until he have done 6213-2 [it], and until he have performed 6965-53 the intents 4209 of his heart: 3820 in the latter 319 days 3117 ye shall consider 995-113 it.

31:1 At the same time, 6256 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 will I be the God 430 of all the families 4940 of Israel, 3478 and they shall be my people. 5971

31:2 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 The people 5971 [which were] left 8300 of the sword 2719 found 4672-1 grace 2580 in the wilderness; 4057 [even] Israel, 3478 when I went 1980-2 to cause him to rest. 7280-53

31:3 The LORD 3068 hath appeared 7200-8 of old 7350 unto me, [saying], Yea, I have loved 157-1 thee with an everlasting 5769 love: 160 therefore with lovingkindness 2617 have I drawn 4900-1 thee.

31:4 Again I will build 1129-4 thee, and thou shalt be built, 1129-8 O virgin 1330 of Israel: 3478 thou shalt again be adorned 5710-4 with thy tabrets, 8596 and shalt go forth 3318-1 in the dances 4234 of them that make merry. 7832-18

31:5 Thou shalt yet plant 5193-4 vines 3754 upon the mountains 2022 of Samaria: 8111 the planters 5193-6 shall plant, 5193-1 and shall eat [them] as common things. 2490-14

31:6 For there shall be 3426 a day, 3117 [that] the watchmen 5341-6 upon the mount 2022 Ephraim 669 shall cry, 7121-1 Arise 6965-3 ye, and let us go up 5927-4 to Zion 6726 unto the LORD 3068 our God. 430

31:7 For thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 Sing 7442-3 with gladness 8057 for Jacob, 3290 and shout 6670-16 among the chief 7218 of the nations: 1471 publish 8085-54 ye, praise 1984-16 ye, and say, 559-3 O LORD, 3068 save 3467-54 thy people, 5971 the remnant 7611 of Israel. 3478

31:8 Behold, I will bring 935-56 them from the north 6828 country, 776 and gather 6908-14 them from the coasts 3411 of the earth, 776 [and] with them the blind 5787 and the lame, 6455 the woman with child 2030 and her that travaileth with child 3205-6 together: 3162 a great 1419 company 6951 shall return 7725-4 thither.

31:9 They shall come 935-4 with weeping, 1065 and with supplications 8469 will I lead 2986-55 them: I will cause them to walk 3212-55 by the rivers 5158 of waters 4325 in a straight 3477 way, 1870 wherein they shall not stumble: 3782-11 for I am a father 1 to Israel, 3478 and Ephraim 669 [is] my firstborn. 1060

31:10 Hear 8085-3 the word 1697 of the LORD, 3068 O ye nations, 1471 and declare 5046-54 [it] in the isles 339 afar off, 4801 and say, 559-3 He that scattered 2219-18 Israel 3478 will gather 6908-17 him, and keep 8104-1 him, as a shepherd 7462-6 [doth] his flock. 5739

31:11 For the LORD 3068 hath redeemed 6299-1 Jacob, 3290 and ransomed 1350-1 him from the hand 3027 of [him that was] stronger 2389 than he.

31:12 Therefore they shall come 935-1 and sing 7442-14 in the height 4791 of Zion, 6726 and shall flow together 5102-1 to the goodness 2898 of the LORD, 3068 for wheat, 1715 and for wine, 8492 and for oil, 3323 and for the young 1121 of the flock 6629 and of the herd: 1241 and their soul 5315 shall be as a watered 7302 garden; 1588 and they shall not sorrow 1669-2 any more 3254-55 at all.

31:13 Then shall the virgin 1330 rejoice 8055-4 in the dance, 4234 both young men 970 and old 2205 together: 3162 for I will turn 2015-1 their mourning 60 into joy, 8342 and will comfort 5162-14 them, and make them rejoice 8055-14 from their sorrow. 3015

31:14 And I will satiate 7301-14 the soul 5315 of the priests 3548 with fatness, 1880 and my people 5971 shall be satisfied 7646-4 with my goodness, 2898 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

31:15 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 A voice 6963 was heard 8085-8 in Ramah, 7414 lamentation, 5092 [and] bitter 8563 weeping; 1065 Rahel 7354 weeping 1058-18 for her children 1121 refused 3985-14 to be comforted 5162-9 for her children, 1121 because they [were] not.

31:16 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 Refrain 4513-3 thy voice 6963 from weeping, 1065 and thine eyes 5869 from tears: 1832 for thy work 6468 shall be 3426 rewarded, 7939 saith 5002-7 the LORD; 3068 and they shall come again 7725-1 from the land 776 of the enemy. 341-6

31:17 And there is 3426 hope 8615 in thine end, 319 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 that thy children 1121 shall come again 7725-1 to their own border. 1366

31:18 I have surely 8085-2 heard 8085-1 Ephraim 669 bemoaning 5110-114 himself [thus]; Thou hast chastised 3256-14 me, and I was chastised, 3256-11 as a bullock 5695 unaccustomed 3808 3925-27 [to the yoke]: turn 7725-54 thou me, and I shall be turned; 7725-4 for thou [art] the LORD 3068 my God. 430

31:19 Surely after 310 that I was turned, 7725-2 I repented; 5162-8 and after 310 that I was instructed, 3045-9 I smote 5606-1 upon [my] thigh: 3409 I was ashamed, 954-1 yea, even confounded, 3637-8 because I did bear 5375-1 the reproach 2781 of my youth. 5271

31:20 [Is] Ephraim 669 my dear 3357 son? 1121 [is he] a pleasant 8191 child? 3206 for since 1767 I spake 1696-15 against him, I do earnestly 2142-2 remember 2142-4 him still: therefore my bowels 4578 are troubled 1993-1 for him; I will surely 7355-15 have mercy 7355-17 upon him, saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

31:21 Set thee up 5324-54 waymarks, 6725 make 7760-3 thee high heaps: 8564 set 7896-3 thine heart 3820 toward the highway, 4546 [even] the way 1870 [which] thou wentest: 1980-1 turn again, 7725-3 O virgin 1330 of Israel, 3478 turn again 7725-3 to these thy cities. 5892

31:22 How long wilt thou go about, 2559-101 O thou backsliding 7728 daughter? 1323 for the LORD 3068 hath created 1254-1 a new thing 2319 in the earth, 776 A woman 5347 shall compass 5437-25 a man. 1397

31:23 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 the God 430 of Israel; 3478 As yet they shall use 559-4 this speech 1697 in the land 776 of Judah 3063 and in the cities 5892 thereof, when I shall bring again 7725-2 their captivity; 7622 The LORD 3068 bless 1288-17 thee, O habitation 5116 of justice, 6664 [and] mountain 2022 of holiness. 6944

31:24 And there shall dwell 3427-1 in Judah 3063 itself, and in all the cities 5892 thereof together, 3162 husbandmen, 406 and they [that] go forth 5265-1 with flocks. 5739

31:25 For I have satiated 7301-52 the weary 5889 soul, 5315 and I have replenished 4390-14 every sorrowful 1669-1 soul. 5315

31:26 Upon this I awaked, 6974-52 and beheld; 7200-4 and my sleep 8142 was sweet 6149-1 unto me.

31:27 Behold, the days 3117 come, 935-6 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 that I will sow 2232-1 the house 1004 of Israel 3478 and the house 1004 of Judah 3063 with the seed 2233 of man, 120 and with the seed 2233 of beast. 929

31:28 And it shall come to pass, [that] like as I have watched 8245-1 over them, to pluck up, 5428-2 and to break down, 5422-2 and to throw down, 2040-2 and to destroy, 6-53 and to afflict; 7489-53 so will I watch 8245-4 over them, to build, 1129-2 and to plant, 5193-2 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

31:29 In those days 3117 they shall say 559-4 no more, The fathers 1 have eaten 398-1 a sour grape, 1155 and the children's 1121 teeth 8127 are set on edge. 6949-4

31:30 But every one 376 shall die 4191-4 for his own iniquity: 5771 every man 120 that eateth 398-6 the sour grape, 1155 his teeth 8127 shall be set on edge. 6949-4

31:31 Behold, the days 3117 come, 935-6 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 that I will make 3772-1 a new 2319 covenant 1285 with the house 1004 of Israel, 3478 and with the house 1004 of Judah: 3063

31:32 Not according to the covenant 1285 that I made 3772-1 with their fathers 1 in the day 3117 [that] I took 2388-53 them by the hand 3027 to bring them out 3318-53 of the land 776 of Egypt; 4714 which my covenant 1285 they brake, 6565-52 although I was an husband 1166-1 unto them, saith 5002-7 the LORD: 3068

31:33 But this [shall be] the covenant 1285 that I will make 3772-4 with the house 1004 of Israel; 3478 After 310 those days, 3117 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 I will put 5414-1 my law 8451 in their inward parts, 7130 and write 3789-4 it in their hearts; 3820 and will be their God, 430 and they shall be my people. 5971

31:34 And they shall teach 3925-17 no more every man 376 his neighbour, 7453 and every man 376 his brother, 251 saying, 559-2 Know 3045-3 the LORD: 3068 for they shall all know 3045-4 me, from the least 6996 of them unto the greatest 1419 of them, saith 5002-7 the LORD: 3068 for I will forgive 5545-4 their iniquity, 5771 and I will remember 2142-4 their sin 2403 no more.

31:35 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 which giveth 5414-6 the sun 8121 for a light 216 by day, 3119 [and] the ordinances 2708 of the moon 3394 and of the stars 3556 for a light 216 by night, 3915 which divideth 7280-6 the sea 3220 when the waves 1530 thereof roar; 1993-4 The LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 [is] his name: 8034

31:36 If those ordinances 2706 depart 4185-4 from before 6440 me, saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 [then] the seed 2233 of Israel 3478 also shall cease 7673-4 from being a nation 1471 before 6440 me for ever. 3605 3117

31:37 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 If heaven 8064 above 4605 can be measured, 4058-11 and the foundations 4144 of the earth 776 searched out 2713-11 beneath, 4295 I will also cast off 3988-4 all the seed 2233 of Israel 3478 for all that they have done, 6213-1 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

31:38 Behold, the days 3117 come, 935-6 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 that the city 5892 shall be built 1129-8 to the LORD 3068 from the tower 4026 of Hananeel 2606 unto the gate 8179 of the corner. 6438

31:39 And the measuring 4060 line 6957|6961-k shall yet go forth 3318-1 over against it upon the hill 1389 Gareb, 1619 and shall compass about 5437-8 to Goath. 1601

31:40 And the whole valley 6010 of the dead bodies, 6297 and of the ashes, 1880 and all the fields 7709|8309-k unto the brook 5158 of Kidron, 6939 unto the corner 6438 of the horse 5483 gate 8179 toward the east, 4217 [shall be] holy 6944 unto the LORD; 3068 it shall not be plucked up, 5428-11 nor thrown down 2040-11 any more for ever. 5769

32:1 The word 1697 that came to Jeremiah 3414 from the LORD 3068 in the tenth 6224 year 8141 of Zedekiah 6667 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 which [was] the 8141 eighteenth 8083 6240 year 8141 of Nebuchadrezzar. 5019

32:2 For then the king 4428 of Babylon's 894 army 2428 besieged 6696-6 Jerusalem: 3389 and Jeremiah 3414 the prophet 5030 was shut up 3607-7 in the court 2691 of the prison, 4307 which [was] in the king 4428 of Judah's 3063 house. 1004

32:3 For Zedekiah 6667 king 4428 of Judah 3063 had shut him up, 3607-1 saying, 559-2 Wherefore dost thou prophesy, 5012-12 and say, 559-2 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Behold, I will give 5414-6 this city 5892 into the hand 3027 of the king 4428 of Babylon, 894 and he shall take 3920-1 it;

32:4 And Zedekiah 6667 king 4428 of Judah 3063 shall not escape 4422-11 out of the hand 3027 of the Chaldeans, 3778 but shall surely 5414-9 be delivered 5414-11 into the hand 3027 of the king 4428 of Babylon, 894 and shall speak 1696-14 with him mouth 6310 to mouth, 6310 and his eyes 5869 shall behold 7200-4 his eyes; 5869

32:5 And he shall lead 3212-55 Zedekiah 6667 to Babylon, 894 and there shall he be until I visit 6485-2 him, saith 5002-7 the LORD: 3068 though ye fight 3898-11 with the Chaldeans, 3778 ye shall not prosper. 6743-55

32:6 And Jeremiah 3414 said, 559-4 The word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto me, saying, 559-2

32:7 Behold, Hanameel 2601 the son 1121 of Shallum 7967 thine uncle 1730 shall come 935-6 unto thee, saying, 559-2 Buy 7069-3 thee my field 7704 that [is] in Anathoth: 6068 for the right 4941 of redemption 1353 [is] thine to buy 7069-2 [it].

32:8 So Hanameel 2601 mine uncle's 1730 son 1121 came 935-4 to me in the court 2691 of the prison 4307 according to the word 1697 of the LORD, 3068 and said 559-4 unto me, Buy 7069-3 my field, 7704 I pray thee, that [is] in Anathoth, 6068 which [is] in the country 776 of Benjamin: 1144 for the right 4941 of inheritance 3425 [is] thine, and the redemption 1353 [is] thine; buy 7069-3 [it] for thyself. Then I knew 3045-4 that this [was] the word 1697 of the LORD. 3068

32:9 And I bought 7069-4 the field 7704 of Hanameel 2601 my uncle's 1730 son, 1121 that [was] in Anathoth, 6068 and weighed 8254-4 him the money, 3701 [even] seventeen 7651 6235 shekels 8255 of silver. 3701

32:10 And I subscribed 3789-4 the evidence, 5612 and sealed 2856-4 [it], and took 5749-55 witnesses, 5707 and weighed 8254-4 [him] the money 3701 in the balances. 3976

32:11 So I took 3947-4 the evidence 5612 of the purchase, 4736 [both] that which was sealed 2856-7 [according] to the law 4687 and custom, 2706 and that which was open: 1540-7

32:12 And I gave 5414-4 the evidence 5612 of the purchase 4736 unto Baruch 1263 the son 1121 of Neriah, 5374 the son 1121 of Maaseiah, 4271 in the sight 5869 of Hanameel 2601 mine uncle's 1730 [son], and in the presence 5869 of the witnesses 5707 that subscribed 3789-6 the book 5612 of the purchase, 4736 before 5869 all the Jews 3064 that sat 3427-6 in the court 2691 of the prison. 4307

32:13 And I charged 6680-17 Baruch 1263 before 5869 them, saying, 559-2

32:14 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 the God 430 of Israel; 3478 Take 3947-2 these evidences, 5612 this evidence 5612 of the purchase, 4736 both which is sealed, 2856-7 and this evidence 5612 which is open; 1540-7 and put 5414-1 them in an earthen 2789 vessel, 3627 that they may continue 5975-4 many 7227 days. 3117

32:15 For thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 the God 430 of Israel; 3478 Houses 1004 and fields 7704 and vineyards 3754 shall be possessed 7069-11 again in this land. 776

32:16 Now when 310 I had delivered 5414-2 the evidence 5612 of the purchase 4736 unto Baruch 1263 the son 1121 of Neriah, 5374 I prayed 6419-101 unto the LORD, 3068 saying, 559-2

32:17 Ah 162 Lord 136 GOD! 3069 behold, thou hast made 6213-1 the heaven 8064 and the earth 776 by thy great 1419 power 3581 and stretched out 5186-7 arm, 2220 [and] there is nothing 1697 too hard 6381-11 for thee:

32:18 Thou shewest 6213-6 lovingkindness 2617 unto thousands, 505 and recompensest 7999-18 the iniquity 5771 of the fathers 1 into the bosom 2436 of their children 1121 after 310 them: the Great, 1419 the Mighty 1368 God, 410 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 [is] his name, 8034

32:19 Great 1419 in counsel, 6098 and mighty 7227 in work: 5950 for thine eyes 5869 [are] open 6491-7 upon all the ways 1870 of the sons 1121 of men: 120 to give 5414-2 every one 376 according to his ways, 1870 and according to the fruit 6529 of his doings: 4611

32:20 Which hast set 7760-1 signs 226 and wonders 4159 in the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 [even] unto this day, 3117 and in Israel, 3478 and among [other] men; 120 and hast made 6213-4 thee a name, 8034 as at this day; 3117

32:21 And hast brought forth 3318-55 thy people 5971 Israel 3478 out of the land 776 of Egypt 4714 with signs, 226 and with wonders, 4159 and with a strong 2389 hand, 3027 and with a stretched out 5186-7 arm, 248 and with great 1419 terror; 4172

32:22 And hast given 5414-4 them this land, 776 which thou didst swear 7650-8 to their fathers 1 to give 5414-2 them, a land 776 flowing 2100-6 with milk 2461 and honey; 1706

32:23 And they came in, 935-4 and possessed 3423-4 it; but they obeyed 8085-1 not thy voice, 6963 neither walked 1980-1 in thy law; 8451 they have done 6213-1 nothing of all that thou commandedst 6680-14 them to do: 6213-2 therefore thou hast caused all this evil 7451 to come 7122-55 upon them:

32:24 Behold the mounts, 5550 they are come 935-1 unto the city 5892 to take 3920-2 it; and the city 5892 is given 5414-8 into the hand 3027 of the Chaldeans, 3778 that fight 3898-12 against it, because 6440 of the sword, 2719 and of the famine, 7458 and of the pestilence: 1698 and what thou hast spoken 1696-14 is come to pass; and, behold, thou seest 7200-6 [it].

32:25 And thou hast said 559-1 unto me, O Lord 136 GOD, 3069 Buy 7069-3 thee the field 7704 for money, 3701 and take 5749-54 witnesses; 5707 for the city 5892 is given 5414-8 into the hand 3027 of the Chaldeans. 3778

32:26 Then came the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 unto Jeremiah, 3414 saying, 559-2

32:27 Behold, I [am] the LORD, 3068 the God 430 of all flesh: 1320 is there any thing 1697 too hard 6381-11 for me?

32:28 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 Behold, I will give 5414-6 this city 5892 into the hand 3027 of the Chaldeans, 3778 and into the hand 3027 of Nebuchadrezzar 5019 king 4428 of Babylon, 894 and he shall take 3920-1 it:

32:29 And the Chaldeans, 3778 that fight 3898-12 against this city, 5892 shall come 935-1 and set 3341-52 fire 784 on this city, 5892 and burn 8313-1 it with the houses, 1004 upon whose roofs 1406 they have offered incense 6999-14 unto Baal, 1168 and poured out 5258-52 drink offerings 5262 unto other 312 gods, 430 to provoke me to anger. 3707-53

32:30 For the children 1121 of Israel 3478 and the children 1121 of Judah 3063 have only done 6213-6 evil 7451 before 5869 me from their youth: 5271 for the children 1121 of Israel 3478 have only provoked me to anger 3707-56 with the work 4639 of their hands, 3027 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

32:31 For this city 5892 hath been to me [as] a provocation of mine anger 639 and of my fury 2534 from the day 3117 that they built 1129-1 it even unto this day; 3117 that I should remove 5493-53 it from before my face, 6440

32:32 Because of all the evil 7451 of the children 1121 of Israel 3478 and of the children 1121 of Judah, 3063 which they have done 6213-1 to provoke me to anger, 3707-53 they, their kings, 4428 their princes, 8269 their priests, 3548 and their prophets, 5030 and the men 376 of Judah, 3063 and the inhabitants 3427-6 of Jerusalem. 3389

32:33 And they have turned 6437-4 unto me the back, 6203 and not the face: 6440 though I taught 3925-15 them, rising up early 7925-53 and teaching 3925-15 [them], yet they have not hearkened 8085-6 to receive 3947-2 instruction. 4148

32:34 But they set 7760-4 their abominations 8251 in the house, 1004 which is called 7121-8 by my name, 8034 to defile 2930-15 it.

32:35 And they built 1129-4 the high places 1116 of Baal, 1168 which [are] in the valley 1516 of the son 1121 of Hinnom, 2011 to cause their sons 1121 and their daughters 1323 to pass 5674-53 through [the fire] unto Molech; 4432 which I commanded 6680-14 them not, neither came 5927-1 it into my mind, 3820 that they should do 6213-2 this abomination, 8441 to cause Judah 3063 to sin. 2398-53

32:36 And now therefore thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 the God 430 of Israel, 3478 concerning this city, 5892 whereof ye say, 559-6 It shall be delivered 5414-8 into the hand 3027 of the king 4428 of Babylon 894 by the sword, 2719 and by the famine, 7458 and by the pestilence; 1698

32:37 Behold, I will gather 6908-18 them out of all countries, 776 whither I have driven 5080-52 them in mine anger, 639 and in my fury, 2534 and in great 1419 wrath; 7110 and I will bring them again 7725-52 unto this place, 4725 and I will cause them to dwell 3427-52 safely: 983

32:38 And they shall be my people, 5971 and I will be their God: 430

32:39 And I will give 5414-1 them one 259 heart, 3820 and one 259 way, 1870 that they may fear 3372-2 me for ever, 3605 3117 for the good 2896 of them, and of their children 1121 after 310 them:

32:40 And I will make 3772-1 an everlasting 5769 covenant 1285 with them, that I will not turn away 7725-4 from 310 them, to do them good; 3190-53 but I will put 5414-4 my fear 3374 in their hearts, 3824 that they shall not depart 5493-2 from me.

32:41 Yea, I will rejoice 7797-1 over them to do them good, 2895-53 and I will plant 5193-1 them in this land 776 assuredly 571 with my whole heart 3820 and with my whole soul. 5315

32:42 For thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 Like as I have brought 935-52 all this great 1419 evil 7451 upon this people, 5971 so will I bring 935-56 upon them all the good 2896 that I have promised 1696-6 them.

32:43 And fields 7704 shall be bought 7069-8 in this land, 776 whereof ye say, 559-6 [It is] desolate 8077 without man 120 or beast; 929 it is given 5414-8 into the hand 3027 of the Chaldeans. 3778

32:44 Men shall buy 7069-4 fields 7704 for money, 3701 and subscribe 3789-2 evidences, 5612 and seal 2856-2 [them], and take 5749-53 witnesses 5707 in the land 776 of Benjamin, 1144 and in the places about 5439 Jerusalem, 3389 and in the cities 5892 of Judah, 3063 and in the cities 5892 of the mountains, 2022 and in the cities 5892 of the valley, 8219 and in the cities 5892 of the south: 5045 for I will cause their captivity 7622 to return, 7725-55 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

33:1 Moreover the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto Jeremiah 3414 the second 8145 time, while he was yet shut up 6113-7 in the court 2691 of the prison, 4307 saying, 559-2

33:2 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 the maker 6213-6 thereof, the LORD 3068 that formed 3335-6 it, to establish 3559-53 it; the LORD 3068 [is] his name; 8034

33:3 Call 7121-3 unto me, and I will answer 6030-4 thee, and shew 5046-55 thee great 1419 and mighty things, 1219-7 which thou knowest 3045-1 not.

33:4 For thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 the God 430 of Israel, 3478 concerning the houses 1004 of this city, 5892 and concerning the houses 1004 of the kings 4428 of Judah, 3063 which are thrown down 5422-7 by the mounts, 5550 and by the sword; 2719

33:5 They come 935-6 to fight 3898-9 with the Chaldeans, 3778 but [it is] to fill 4390-15 them with the dead bodies 6297 of men, 120 whom I have slain 5221-52 in mine anger 639 and in my fury, 2534 and for all whose wickedness 7451 I have hid 5641-52 my face 6440 from this city. 5892

33:6 Behold, I will bring 5927-56 it health 724 and cure, 4832 and I will cure 7495-1 them, and will reveal 1540-14 unto them the abundance 6283 of peace 7965 and truth. 571

33:7 And I will cause the captivity 7622 of Judah 3063 and the captivity 7622 of Israel 3478 to return, 7725-52 and will build 1129-1 them, as at the first. 7223

33:8 And I will cleanse 2891-14 them from all their iniquity, 5771 whereby they have sinned 2398-1 against me; and I will pardon 5545-1 all their iniquities, 5771 whereby they have sinned, 2398-1 and whereby they have transgressed 6586-1 against me.

33:9 And it shall be to me a name 8034 of joy, 8342 a praise 8416 and an honour 8597 before all the nations 1471 of the earth, 776 which shall hear 8085-4 all the good 2896 that I do 6213-6 unto them: and they shall fear 6342-1 and tremble 7264-1 for all the goodness 2896 and for all the prosperity 7965 that I procure 6213-6 unto it.

33:10 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 Again there shall be heard 8085-11 in this place, 4725 which ye say 559-6 [shall be] desolate 2720 without man 120 and without beast, 929 [even] in the cities 5892 of Judah, 3063 and in the streets 2351 of Jerusalem, 3389 that are desolate, 8074-12 without man, 120 and without inhabitant, 3427-6 and without beast, 929

33:11 The voice 6963 of joy, 8342 and the voice 6963 of gladness, 8057 the voice 6963 of the bridegroom, 2860 and the voice 6963 of the bride, 3618 the voice 6963 of them that shall say, 559-6 Praise 3034-54 the LORD 3068 of hosts: 6635 for the LORD 3068 [is] good; 2896 for his mercy 2617 [endureth] for ever: 5769 [and] of them that shall bring 935-56 the sacrifice of praise 8426 into the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068 For I will cause to return 7725-55 the captivity 7622 of the land, 776 as at the first, 7223 saith 559-1 the LORD. 3068

33:12 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts; 6635 Again in this place, 4725 which is desolate 2720 without man 120 and without beast, 929 and in all the cities 5892 thereof, shall be an habitation 5116 of shepherds 7462-6 causing [their] flocks 6629 to lie down. 7257-56

33:13 In the cities 5892 of the mountains, 2022 in the cities 5892 of the vale, 8219 and in the cities 5892 of the south, 5045 and in the land 776 of Benjamin, 1144 and in the places about 5439 Jerusalem, 3389 and in the cities 5892 of Judah, 3063 shall the flocks 6629 pass 5674-4 again under the hands 3027 of him that telleth 4487-6 [them], saith 559-1 the LORD. 3068

33:14 Behold, the days 3117 come, 935-6 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 that I will perform 6965-52 that good 2896 thing 1697 which I have promised 1696-14 unto the house 1004 of Israel 3478 and to the house 1004 of Judah. 3063

33:15 In those days, 3117 and at that time, 6256 will I cause the Branch 6780 of righteousness 6666 to grow up 6779-55 unto David; 1732 and he shall execute 6213-1 judgment 4941 and righteousness 6666 in the land. 776

33:16 In those days 3117 shall Judah 3063 be saved, 3467-11 and Jerusalem 3389 shall dwell 7931-4 safely: 983 and this [is the name] wherewith she shall be called, 7121-4 The LORD our righteousness. 3068|6664|3072

33:17 For thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 David 1732 shall never 3808 want 3772-11 a man 376 to sit 3427-6 upon the throne 3678 of the house 1004 of Israel; 3478

33:18 Neither shall the priests 3548 the Levites 3881 want 3772-11 a man 376 before 6440 me to offer 5927-56 burnt offerings, 5930 and to kindle 6999-56 meat offerings, 4503 and to do 6213-6 sacrifice 2077 continually. 3605 3117

33:19 And the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto Jeremiah, 3414 saying, 559-2

33:20 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 If ye can break 6565-55 my covenant 1285 of the day, 3117 and my covenant 1285 of the night, 3915 and that there should not be day 3119 and night 3915 in their season; 6256

33:21 [Then] may also my covenant 1285 be broken 6565-93 with David 1732 my servant, 5650 that he should not have a son 1121 to reign 4427-6 upon his throne; 3678 and with the Levites 3881 the priests, 3548 my ministers. 8334-18

33:22 As the host 6635 of heaven 8064 cannot be numbered, 5608-11 neither the sand 2344 of the sea 3220 measured: 4058-11 so will I multiply 7235-55 the seed 2233 of David 1732 my servant, 5650 and the Levites 3881 that minister 8334-18 unto me.

33:23 Moreover the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came to Jeremiah, 3414 saying, 559-2

33:24 Considerest 7200-1 thou not what this people 5971 have spoken, 1696-14 saying, 559-2 The two 8147 families 4940 which the LORD 3068 hath chosen, 977-1 he hath even cast them off? 3988-4 thus they have despised 5006-4 my people, 5971 that they should be no more a nation 1471 before 6440 them.

33:25 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 If my covenant 1285 [be] not with day 3119 and night, 3915 [and if] I have not appointed 7760-1 the ordinances 2708 of heaven 8064 and earth; 776

33:26 Then 1571 will I cast away 3988-4 the seed 2233 of Jacob, 3290 and David 1732 my servant, 5650 [so] that I will not take 3947-2 [any] of his seed 2233 [to be] rulers 4910-6 over the seed 2233 of Abraham, 85 Isaac, 3446 and Jacob: 3290 for I will cause their captivity 7622 to return, 7725-55|7725-4-k and have mercy 7355-14 on them.

34:1 The word 1697 which came unto Jeremiah 3414 from the LORD, 3068 when Nebuchadnezzar 5019 king 4428 of Babylon, 894 and all his army, 2428 and all the kingdoms 4467 of the earth 776 of his dominion, 3027 4475 and all the people, 5971 fought 3898-12 against Jerusalem, 3389 and against all the cities 5892 thereof, saying, 559-2

34:2 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 the God 430 of Israel; 3478 Go 1980-2 and speak 559-1 to Zedekiah 6667 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 and tell 559-1 him, Thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 Behold, I will give 5414-6 this city 5892 into the hand 3027 of the king 4428 of Babylon, 894 and he shall burn 8313-1 it with fire: 784

34:3 And thou shalt not escape 4422-11 out of his hand, 3027 but shalt surely 8610-2 be taken, 8610-11 and delivered 5414-11 into his hand; 3027 and thine eyes 5869 shall behold 7200-4 the eyes 5869 of the king 4428 of Babylon, 894 and he shall speak 1696-17 with thee mouth 6310 to mouth, 6310 and thou shalt go 935-4 to Babylon. 894

34:4 Yet hear 8085-3 the word 1697 of the LORD, 3068 O Zedekiah 6667 king 4428 of Judah; 3063 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of thee, Thou shalt not die 4191-4 by the sword: 2719

34:5 [But] thou shalt die 4191-4 in peace: 7965 and with the burnings 4955 of thy fathers, 1 the former 7223 kings 4428 which were before 6440 thee, so shall they burn 8313-4 [odours] for thee; and they will lament 5594-4 thee, [saying], Ah 1945 lord! 113 for I have pronounced 1696-14 the word, 1697 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

34:6 Then Jeremiah 3414 the prophet 5030 spake 1696-17 all these words 1697 unto Zedekiah 6667 king 4428 of Judah 3063 in Jerusalem, 3389

34:7 When the king 4428 of Babylon's 894 army 2428 fought 3898-12 against Jerusalem, 3389 and against all the cities 5892 of Judah 3063 that were left, 3498-12 against Lachish, 3923 and against Azekah: 5825 for these defenced 4013 cities 5892 remained 7604-8 of the cities 5892 of Judah. 3063

34:8 [This is] the word 1697 that came unto Jeremiah 3414 from the LORD, 3068 after 310 that the king 4428 Zedekiah 6667 had made 3772-2 a covenant 1285 with all the people 5971 which [were] at Jerusalem, 3389 to proclaim 7121-2 liberty 1865 unto them;

34:9 That every man 376 should let his manservant, 5650 and every man 376 his maidservant, 8198 [being] an Hebrew 5680 or an Hebrewess, 5680 go 7971-15 free; 2670 that none 376 should serve 5647-2 himself of them, [to wit], of a Jew 3064 his brother. 251

34:10 Now when all the princes, 8269 and all the people, 5971 which had entered 935-1 into the covenant, 1285 heard 8085-4 that every one 376 should let his manservant, 5650 and every one 376 his maidservant, 8198 go 7971-15 free, 2670 that none should serve 5647-2 themselves of them any more, then they obeyed, 8085-4 and let [them] go. 7971-17

34:11 But afterward 310 they turned, 7725-4 and caused the servants 5650 and the handmaids, 8198 whom they had let go 7971-14 free, 2670 to return, 7725-55 and brought them into subjection 3533-4|3533-55-k for servants 5650 and for handmaids. 8198

34:12 Therefore the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came to Jeremiah 3414 from the LORD, 3068 saying, 559-2

34:13 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 the God 430 of Israel; 3478 I made 3772-1 a covenant 1285 with your fathers 1 in the day 3117 that I brought them forth 3318-53 out of the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 out of the house 1004 of bondmen, 5650 saying, 559-2

34:14 At the end 7093 of seven 7651 years 8141 let ye go 7971-17 every man 376 his brother 251 an Hebrew, 5680 which hath been sold 4376-11 unto thee; and when he hath served 5647-1 thee six 8337 years, 8141 thou shalt let him go 7971-14 free 2670 from thee: but your fathers 1 hearkened 8085-1 not unto me, neither inclined 5186-52 their ear. 241

34:15 And ye were now 3117 turned, 7725-4 and had done 6213-4 right 3477 in my sight, 5869 in proclaiming 7121-2 liberty 1865 every man 376 to his neighbour; 7453 and ye had made 3772-4 a covenant 1285 before 6440 me in the house 1004 which is called 7121-8 by my name: 8034

34:16 But ye turned 7725-4 and polluted 2490-17 my name, 8034 and caused every man 376 his servant, 5650 and every man 376 his handmaid, 8198 whom ye had set 7971-14 at liberty 2670 at their pleasure, 5315 to return, 7725-55 and brought them into subjection, 3533-4 to be unto you for servants 5650 and for handmaids. 8198

34:17 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 Ye have not hearkened 8085-1 unto me, in proclaiming 7121-2 liberty, 1865 every one 376 to his brother, 251 and every man 376 to his neighbour: 7453 behold, I proclaim 7121-6 a liberty 1865 for you, saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 to the sword, 2719 to the pestilence, 1698 and to the famine; 7458 and I will make 5414-1 you to be removed 2189|2113-k into all the kingdoms 4467 of the earth. 776

34:18 And I will give 5414-1 the men 582 that have transgressed 5674-6 my covenant, 1285 which have not performed 6965-52 the words 1697 of the covenant 1285 which they had made 3772-1 before 6440 me, when they cut 3772-1 the calf 5695 in twain, 8147 and passed 5674-4 between the parts 1335 thereof,

34:19 The princes 8269 of Judah, 3063 and the princes 8269 of Jerusalem, 3389 the eunuchs, 5631 and the priests, 3548 and all the people 5971 of the land, 776 which passed 5674-6 between the parts 1335 of the calf; 5695

34:20 I will even give 5414-1 them into the hand 3027 of their enemies, 341-6 and into the hand 3027 of them that seek 1245-18 their life: 5315 and their dead bodies 5038 shall be for meat 3978 unto the fowls 5775 of the heaven, 8064 and to the beasts 929 of the earth. 776

34:21 And Zedekiah 6667 king 4428 of Judah 3063 and his princes 8269 will I give 5414-4 into the hand 3027 of their enemies, 341-6 and into the hand 3027 of them that seek 1245-18 their life, 5315 and into the hand 3027 of the king 4428 of Babylon's 894 army, 2428 which are gone up 5927-6 from you.

34:22 Behold, I will command, 6680-18 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 and cause them to return 7725-52 to this city; 5892 and they shall fight 3898-8 against it, and take 3920-1 it, and burn 8313-1 it with fire: 784 and I will make 5414-4 the cities 5892 of Judah 3063 a desolation 8077 without an inhabitant. 3427-6

35:1 The word 1697 which came unto Jeremiah 3414 from the LORD 3068 in the days 3117 of Jehoiakim 3079 the son 1121 of Josiah 2977 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 saying, 559-2

35:2 Go 1980-2 unto the house 1004 of the Rechabites, 7397 and speak 1696-14 unto them, and bring 935-52 them into the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 into one 259 of the chambers, 3957 and give them wine 3196 to drink. 8248-52

35:3 Then I took 3947-4 Jaazaniah 2970 the son 1121 of Jeremiah, 3414 the son 1121 of Habaziniah, 2262 and his brethren, 251 and all his sons, 1121 and the whole house 1004 of the Rechabites; 7397

35:4 And I brought them into 935-55 the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 into the chamber 3957 of the sons 1121 of Hanan, 2605 the son 1121 of Igdaliah, 3012 a man 376 of God, 430 which [was] by 681 the chamber 3957 of the princes, 8269 which [was] above 4605 the chamber 3957 of Maaseiah 4641 the son 1121 of Shallum, 7967 the keeper 8104-6 of the door: 5592

35:5 And I set 5414-4 before 6440 the sons 1121 of the house 1004 of the Rechabites 7397 pots 1375 full 4392 of wine, 3196 and cups, 3563 and I said 559-4 unto them, Drink 8354-3 ye wine. 3196

35:6 But they said, 559-4 We will drink 8354-4 no wine: 3196 for Jonadab 3122 the son 1121 of Rechab 7394 our father 1 commanded 6680-14 us, saying, 559-2 Ye shall drink 8354-4 no wine, 3196 [neither ye], nor your sons 1121 for 5704 ever: 5769

35:7 Neither shall ye build 1129-4 house, 1004 nor sow 2232-4 seed, 2233 nor plant 5193-4 vineyard, 3754 nor have [any]: but all your days 3117 ye shall dwell 3427-4 in tents; 168 that ye may live 2421-4 many 7227 days 3117 in 6440 the land 127 where ye [be] strangers. 1481-6

35:8 Thus have we obeyed 8085-4 the voice 6963 of Jonadab 3082 the son 1121 of Rechab 7394 our father 1 in all that he hath charged 6680-14 us, to drink 8354-2 no wine 3196 all our days, 3117 we, our wives, 802 our sons, 1121 nor our daughters; 1323

35:9 Nor to build 1129-2 houses 1004 for us to dwell in: 3427-2 neither have we vineyard, 3754 nor field, 7704 nor seed: 2233

35:10 But we have dwelt 3427-4 in tents, 168 and have obeyed, 8085-4 and done 6213-4 according to all that Jonadab 3122 our father 1 commanded 6680-14 us.

35:11 But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar 5019 king 4428 of Babylon 894 came up 5927-2 into the land, 776 that we said, 559-4 Come, 935-3 and let us go 935-4 to Jerusalem 3389 for fear 6440 of the army 2428 of the Chaldeans, 3778 and for fear 6440 of the army 2428 of the Syrians: 758 so we dwell 3427-4 at Jerusalem. 3389

35:12 Then came the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 unto Jeremiah, 3414 saying, 559-2

35:13 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 the God 430 of Israel; 3478 Go 1980-2 and tell 559-1 the men 376 of Judah 3063 and the inhabitants 3427-6 of Jerusalem, 3389 Will ye not receive 3947-4 instruction 4148 to hearken 8085-2 to my words? 1697 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

35:14 The words 1697 of Jonadab 3082 the son 1121 of Rechab, 7394 that he commanded 6680-14 his sons 1121 not to drink 8354-2 wine, 3196 are performed; 6965-90 for unto this day 3117 they drink 8354-1 none, but obey 8085-1 their father's 1 commandment: 4687 notwithstanding I have spoken 1696-14 unto you, rising early 7925-53 and speaking; 1696-15 but ye hearkened 8085-1 not unto me.

35:15 I have sent 7971-4 also unto you all my servants 5650 the prophets, 5030 rising up early 7925-53 and sending 7971-2 [them], saying, 559-2 Return 7725-3 ye now every man 376 from his evil 7451 way, 1870 and amend 3190-54 your doings, 4611 and go 3212-4 not after 310 other 312 gods 430 to serve 5647-2 them, and ye shall dwell 3427-3 in the land 127 which I have given 5414-1 to you and to your fathers: 1 but ye have not inclined 5186-52 your ear, 241 nor hearkened 8085-1 unto me.

35:16 Because the sons 1121 of Jonadab 3082 the son 1121 of Rechab 7394 have performed 6965-52 the commandment 4687 of their father, 1 which he commanded 6680-14 them; but this people 5971 hath not hearkened 8085-1 unto me:

35:17 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 God 430 of hosts, 6635 the God 430 of Israel; 3478 Behold, I will bring 935-56 upon Judah 3063 and upon all the inhabitants 3427-6 of Jerusalem 3389 all the evil 7451 that I have pronounced 1696-14 against them: because I have spoken 1696-14 unto them, but they have not heard; 8085-1 and I have called 7121-4 unto them, but they have not answered. 6030-1

35:18 And Jeremiah 3414 said 559-1 unto the house 1004 of the Rechabites, 7397 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 the God 430 of Israel; 3478 Because ye have obeyed 8085-1 the commandment 4687 of Jonadab 3082 your father, 1 and kept 8104-4 all his precepts, 4687 and done 6213-4 according unto all that he hath commanded 6680-14 you:

35:19 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 the God 430 of Israel; 3478 Jonadab 3122 the son 1121 of Rechab 7394 shall not want 3772-11 a man 376 to stand 5975-6 before 6440 me for ever. 3605 3117

36:1 And it came to pass in the fourth 7243 year 8141 of Jehoiakim 3079 the son 1121 of Josiah 2977 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 [that] this word 1697 came unto Jeremiah 3414 from the LORD, 3068 saying, 559-2

36:2 Take 3947-3 thee a roll 4039 of a book, 5612 and write 3789-1 therein all the words 1697 that I have spoken 1696-14 unto thee against Israel, 3478 and against Judah, 3063 and against all the nations, 1471 from the day 3117 I spake 1696-14 unto thee, from the days 3117 of Josiah, 2977 even unto this day. 3117

36:3 It may be that the house 1004 of Judah 3063 will hear 8085-4 all the evil 7451 which I purpose 2803-6 to do 6213-2 unto them; that they may return 7725-4 every man 376 from his evil 7451 way; 1870 that I may forgive 5545-1 their iniquity 5771 and their sin. 2403

36:4 Then Jeremiah 3414 called 7121-4 Baruch 1263 the son 1121 of Neriah: 5374 and Baruch 1263 wrote 3789-4 from the mouth 6310 of Jeremiah 3414 all the words 1697 of the LORD, 3068 which he had spoken 1696-14 unto him, upon a roll 4039 of a book. 5612

36:5 And Jeremiah 3414 commanded 6680-17 Baruch, 1263 saying, 559-2 I [am] shut up; 6113-7 I cannot 3808 3201-4 go 935-2 into the house 1004 of the LORD: 3068

36:6 Therefore go 935-1 thou, and read 7121-1 in the roll, 4039 which thou hast written 3789-1 from my mouth, 6310 the words 1697 of the LORD 3068 in the ears 241 of the people 5971 in the LORD'S 3068 house 1004 upon the fasting 6685 day: 3117 and also thou shalt read 7121-4 them in the ears 241 of all Judah 3063 that come out 935-6 of their cities. 5892

36:7 It may be they will present 5307-4 their supplication 8467 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 and will return 7725-4 every one 376 from his evil 7451 way: 1870 for great 1419 [is] the anger 639 and the fury 2534 that the LORD 3068 hath pronounced 1696-14 against this people. 5971

36:8 And Baruch 1263 the son 1121 of Neriah 5374 did 6213-4 according to all that Jeremiah 3414 the prophet 5030 commanded 6680-14 him, reading 7121-2 in the book 5612 the words 1697 of the LORD 3068 in the LORD'S 3068 house. 1004

36:9 And it came to pass in the fifth 2549 year 8141 of Jehoiakim 3079 the son 1121 of Josiah 2977 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 in the ninth 8671 month, 2320 [that] they proclaimed 7121-1 a fast 6685 before 6440 the LORD 3068 to all the people 5971 in Jerusalem, 3389 and to all the people 5971 that came 935-6 from the cities 5892 of Judah 3063 unto Jerusalem. 3389

36:10 Then read 7121-4 Baruch 1263 in the book 5612 the words 1697 of Jeremiah 3414 in the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 in the chamber 3957 of Gemariah 1587 the son 1121 of Shaphan 8227 the scribe, 5608-6 in the higher 5945 court, 2691 at the entry 6607 of the new 2319 gate 8179 of the LORD'S 3068 house, 1004 in the ears 241 of all the people. 5971

36:11 When Michaiah 4321 the son 1121 of Gemariah, 1587 the son 1121 of Shaphan, 8227 had heard 8085-4 out of the book 5612 all the words 1697 of the LORD, 3068

36:12 Then he went down 3381-4 into the king's 4428 house, 1004 into the scribe's 5608-6 chamber: 3957 and, lo, all the princes 8269 sat 3427-6 there, [even] Elishama 476 the scribe, 5608-6 and Delaiah 1806 the son 1121 of Shemaiah, 8098 and Elnathan 494 the son 1121 of Achbor, 5907 and Gemariah 1587 the son 1121 of Shaphan, 8227 and Zedekiah 6667 the son 1121 of Hananiah, 2608 and all the princes. 8269

36:13 Then Michaiah 4321 declared 5046-55 unto them all the words 1697 that he had heard, 8085-1 when Baruch 1263 read 7121-2 the book 5612 in the ears 241 of the people. 5971

36:14 Therefore all the princes 8269 sent 7971-4 Jehudi 3065 the son 1121 of Nethaniah, 5418 the son 1121 of Shelemiah, 8018 the son 1121 of Cushi, 3569 unto Baruch, 1263 saying, 559-2 Take 3947-3 in thine hand 3027 the roll 4039 wherein thou hast read 7121-1 in the ears 241 of the people, 5971 and come. 3212-3 So Baruch 1263 the son 1121 of Neriah 5374 took 3947-4 the roll 4039 in his hand, 3027 and came 935-4 unto them.

36:15 And they said 559-4 unto him, Sit down 3427-3 now, and read 7121-3 it in our ears. 241 So Baruch 1263 read 7121-4 [it] in their ears. 241

36:16 Now it came to pass, when they had heard 8085-2 all the words, 1697 they were afraid 6342-1 both 413 one 376 and other, 7453 and said 559-4 unto Baruch, 1263 We will surely 5046-53 tell 5046-55 the king 4428 of all these words. 1697

36:17 And they asked 7592-1 Baruch, 1263 saying, 559-2 Tell 5046-54 us now, How didst thou write 3789-1 all these words 1697 at his mouth? 6310

36:18 Then Baruch 1263 answered 559-4 them, He pronounced 7121-4 all these words 1697 unto me with his mouth, 6310 and I wrote 3789-6 [them] with ink 1773 in the book. 5612

36:19 Then said 559-4 the princes 8269 unto Baruch, 1263 Go, 3212-3 hide 5641-10 thee, thou and Jeremiah; 3414 and let no man 376 know 3045-4 where 375 ye be.

36:20 And they went in 935-4 to the king 4428 into the court, 2691 but they laid up 6485-52 the roll 4039 in the chamber 3957 of Elishama 476 the scribe, 5608-6 and told 5046-55 all the words 1697 in the ears 241 of the king. 4428

36:21 So the king 4428 sent 7971-4 Jehudi 3065 to fetch 3947-2 the roll: 4039 and he took 3947-4 it out of Elishama 476 the scribe's 5608-6 chamber. 3957 And Jehudi 3065 read 7121-4 it in the ears 241 of the king, 4428 and in the ears 241 of all the princes 8269 which stood 5975-6 beside 5921 the king. 4428

36:22 Now the king 4428 sat 3427-6 in the winterhouse 1004 2779 in the ninth 8671 month: 2320 and [there was a fire] on the hearth 254 burning 1197-30 before 6440 him.

36:23 And it came to pass, [that] when Jehudi 3065 had read 7121-2 three 7969 or four 702 leaves, 1817 he cut 7167-4 it with the penknife, 8593 5608-6 and cast 7993-53 [it] into the fire 784 that [was] on the hearth, 254 until all the roll 4039 was consumed 8552-2 in the fire 784 that [was] on the hearth. 254

36:24 Yet they were not afraid, 6342-1 nor rent 7167-1 their garments, 899 [neither] the king, 4428 nor any of his servants 5650 that heard 8085-6 all these words. 1697

36:25 Nevertheless Elnathan 494 and Delaiah 1806 and Gemariah 1587 had made intercession 6293-52 to the king 4428 that he would not burn 8313-2 the roll: 4039 but he would not hear 8085-1 them.

36:26 But the king 4428 commanded 6680-17 Jerahmeel 3396 the son 1121 of Hammelech, 4428|4429 and Seraiah 8304 the son 1121 of Azriel, 5837 and Shelemiah 8018 the son 1121 of Abdeel, 5655 to take 3947-2 Baruch 1263 the scribe 5608-6 and Jeremiah 3414 the prophet: 5030 but the LORD 3068 hid 5641-55 them.

36:27 Then the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came to Jeremiah, 3414 after 310 that the king 4428 had burned 8313-2 the roll, 4039 and the words 1697 which Baruch 1263 wrote 3789-1 at the mouth 6310 of Jeremiah, 3414 saying, 559-2

36:28 Take 3947-3 thee again 7725-3 another 312 roll, 4039 and write 3789-3 in it all the former 7223 words 1697 that were in the first 7223 roll, 4039 which Jehoiakim 3079 the king 4428 of Judah 3063 hath burned. 8313-1

36:29 And thou shalt say 559-4 to Jehoiakim 3079 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 Thou hast burned 8313-1 this roll, 4039 saying, 559-2 Why hast thou written 3789-1 therein, saying, 559-2 The king 4428 of Babylon 894 shall certainly 935-2 come 935-4 and destroy 7843-52 this land, 776 and shall cause to cease 7673-52 from thence man 120 and beast? 929

36:30 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of Jehoiakim 3079 king 4428 of Judah; 3063 He shall have none to sit 3427-6 upon the throne 3678 of David: 1732 and his dead body 5038 shall be cast out 7993-94 in the day 3117 to the heat, 2721 and in the night 3915 to the frost. 7140

36:31 And I will punish 6485-1 him and his seed 2233 and his servants 5650 for their iniquity; 5771 and I will bring 935-52 upon them, and upon the inhabitants 3427-6 of Jerusalem, 3389 and upon the men 376 of Judah, 3063 all the evil 7451 that I have pronounced 1696-14 against them; but they hearkened 8085-1 not.

36:32 Then took 3947-1 Jeremiah 3414 another 312 roll, 4039 and gave 5414-4 it to Baruch 1263 the scribe, 5608-6 the son 1121 of Neriah; 5374 who wrote 3789-4 therein from the mouth 6310 of Jeremiah 3414 all the words 1697 of the book 5612 which Jehoiakim 3079 king 4428 of Judah 3063 had burned 8313-1 in the fire: 784 and there were added 3254-8 besides unto them many 7227 like 1992 words. 1697

37:1 And king 4428 Zedekiah 6667 the son 1121 of Josiah 2977 reigned 4427-4 instead of Coniah 3659 the son 1121 of Jehoiakim, 3079 whom Nebuchadrezzar 5019 king 4428 of Babylon 894 made king 4427-52 in the land 776 of Judah. 3063

37:2 But neither he, nor his servants, 5650 nor the people 5971 of the land, 776 did hearken 8085-1 unto the words 1697 of the LORD, 3068 which he spake 1696-14 by 3027 the prophet 5030 Jeremiah. 3414

37:3 And Zedekiah 6667 the king 4428 sent 7971-4 Jehucal 3081 the son 1121 of Shelemiah 8018 and Zephaniah 6846 the son 1121 of Maaseiah 4641 the priest 3548 to the prophet 5030 Jeremiah, 3414 saying, 559-2 Pray 6419-100 now unto the LORD 3068 our God 430 for us.

37:4 Now Jeremiah 3414 came in 935-1 and went out 3318-6 among 8432 the people: 5971 for they had not put 5414-1 him into prison. 1004 3628

37:5 Then Pharaoh's 6547 army 2428 was come forth 3318-1 out of Egypt: 4714 and when the Chaldeans 3778 that besieged 6696-6 Jerusalem 3389 heard 8085-4 tidings 8088 of them, they departed 5927-11 from Jerusalem. 3389

37:6 Then came the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 unto the prophet 5030 Jeremiah, 3414 saying, 559-2

37:7 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 the God 430 of Israel; 3478 Thus shall ye say 559-4 to the king 4428 of Judah, 3063 that sent 7971-6 you unto me to enquire 1875-2 of me; Behold, Pharaoh's 6547 army, 2428 which is come forth 3318-6 to help 5833 you, shall return 7725-1 to Egypt 4714 into their own land. 776

37:8 And the Chaldeans 3778 shall come again, 7725-1 and fight 3898-8 against this city, 5892 and take 3920-1 it, and burn 8313-1 it with fire. 784

37:9 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 Deceive 5377-55 not yourselves, 5315 saying, 559-2 The Chaldeans 3778 shall surely 1980-2 depart 3212-4 from us: for they shall not depart. 3212-4

37:10 For though ye had smitten 5221-52 the whole army 2428 of the Chaldeans 3778 that fight 3898-12 against you, and there remained 7604-8 [but] wounded 1856-30 men 582 among them, [yet] should they rise up 6965-4 every man 376 in his tent, 168 and burn 8313-1 this city 5892 with fire. 784

37:11 And it came to pass, that when the army 2428 of the Chaldeans 3778 was broken up 5927-9 from Jerusalem 3389 for fear 6440 of Pharaoh's 6547 army, 2428

37:12 Then Jeremiah 3414 went forth 3318-4 out of Jerusalem 3389 to go 3212-2 into the land 776 of Benjamin, 1144 to separate 2505-53 himself thence in the midst 8432 of the people. 5971

37:13 And when he was in the gate 8179 of Benjamin, 1144 a captain 1167 of the ward 6488 [was] there, whose name 8034 [was] Irijah, 3376 the son 1121 of Shelemiah, 8018 the son 1121 of Hananiah; 2608 and he took 8610-4 Jeremiah 3414 the prophet, 5030 saying, 559-2 Thou fallest away 5307-6 to the Chaldeans. 3778

37:14 Then said 559-4 Jeremiah, 3414 [It is] false; 8267 I fall not away 5307-6 to the Chaldeans. 3778 But he hearkened 8085-1 not to him: so Irijah 3376 took 8610-4 Jeremiah, 3414 and brought 935-55 him to the princes. 8269

37:15 Wherefore the princes 8269 were wroth 7107-4 with Jeremiah, 3414 and smote 5221-52 him, and put 5414-1 him in prison 612 1004 in the house 1004 of Jonathan 3083 the scribe: 5608-6 for they had made 6213-1 that the prison. 3608 1004

37:16 When Jeremiah 3414 was entered 935-1 into the dungeon, 1004 953 and into the cabins, 2588 and Jeremiah 3414 had remained 3427-4 there many 7227 days; 3117

37:17 Then Zedekiah 6667 the king 4428 sent, 7971-4 and took him out: 3947-4 and the king 4428 asked 7592-4 him secretly 5643 in his house, 1004 and said, 559-4 Is there 3426 [any] word 1697 from the LORD? 3068 And Jeremiah 3414 said, 559-4 There is: 3426 for, said 559-4 he, thou shalt be delivered 5414-11 into the hand 3027 of the king 4428 of Babylon. 894

37:18 Moreover Jeremiah 3414 said 559-4 unto king 4428 Zedekiah, 6667 What have I offended 2398-1 against thee, or against thy servants, 5650 or against this people, 5971 that ye have put 5414-1 me in prison? 1004 3608

37:19 Where [are] now 346 your prophets 5030 which prophesied 5012-8 unto you, saying, 559-2 The king 4428 of Babylon 894 shall not come 935-4 against you, nor against this land? 776

37:20 Therefore hear 8085-3 now, I pray thee, O my lord 113 the king: 4428 let my supplication, 8467 I pray thee, be accepted 5307-4 before 6440 thee; that thou cause me not to return 7725-55 to the house 1004 of Jonathan 3083 the scribe, 5608-6 lest I die 4191-4 there.

37:21 Then Zedekiah 6667 the king 4428 commanded 6680-17 that they should commit 6485-55 Jeremiah 3414 into the court 2691 of the prison, 4307 and that they should give 5414-2 him daily 3117 a piece 3603 of bread 3899 out of the bakers' 644-6 street, 2351 until all the bread 3899 in the city 5892 were spent. 8552-2 Thus Jeremiah 3414 remained 3427-4 in the court 2691 of the prison. 4307

38:1 Then Shephatiah 8203 the son 1121 of Mattan, 4977 and Gedaliah 1436 the son 1121 of Pashur, 6583 and Jucal 3116 the son 1121 of Shelemiah, 8018 and Pashur 6583 the son 1121 of Malchiah, 4441 heard 8085-4 the words 1697 that Jeremiah 3414 had spoken 1696-18 unto all the people, 5971 saying, 559-2

38:2 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 He that remaineth 3427-6 in this city 5892 shall die 4191-4 by the sword, 2719 by the famine, 7458 and by the pestilence: 1698 but he that goeth forth 3318-6 to the Chaldeans 3778 shall live; 2421-1|2421-4-k for he shall have his life 5315 for a prey, 7998 and shall live. 2425-1

38:3 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 This city 5892 shall surely 5414-9 be given 5414-11 into the hand 3027 of the king 4428 of Babylon's 894 army, 2428 which shall take 3920-1 it.

38:4 Therefore the princes 8269 said 559-4 unto the king, 4428 We beseech thee, let this man 376 be put to death: 4191-93 for thus 3651 he weakeneth 7503-18 the hands 3027 of the men 582 of war 4421 that remain 7604-12 in this city, 5892 and the hands 3027 of all the people, 5971 in speaking 1696-15 such words 1697 unto them: for this man 376 seeketh 1875-6 not the welfare 7965 of this people, 5971 but the hurt. 7451

38:5 Then Zedekiah 6667 the king 4428 said, 559-4 Behold, he [is] in your hand: 3027 for the king 4428 [is] not [he that] can 3201-4 do [any] thing 1697 against you.

38:6 Then took 3947-4 they Jeremiah, 3414 and cast 7993-55 him into the dungeon 953 of Malchiah 4441 the son 1121 of Hammelech, 4428|4429 that [was] in the court 2691 of the prison: 4307 and they let down 7971-17 Jeremiah 3414 with cords. 2256 And in the dungeon 953 [there was] no water, 4325 but mire: 2916 so Jeremiah 3414 sunk 2883-4 in the mire. 2916

38:7 Now when Ebedmelech 5663 the Ethiopian, 3569 one 376 of the eunuchs 5631 which was in the king's 4428 house, 1004 heard 8085-4 that they had put 5414-1 Jeremiah 3414 in the dungeon; 953 the king 4428 then sitting 3427-6 in the gate 8179 of Benjamin; 1144

38:8 Ebedmelech 5663 went forth 3318-4 out of the king's 4428 house, 1004 and spake 1696-17 to the king, 4428 saying, 559-2

38:9 My lord 113 the king, 4428 these men 582 have done evil 7489-52 in all that they have done 6213-1 to Jeremiah 3414 the prophet, 5030 whom they have cast 7993-52 into the dungeon; 953 and he is like to die 4191-4 for 6440 hunger 7458 in the place where he is: 8478 for [there is] no more bread 3899 in the city. 5892

38:10 Then the king 4428 commanded 6680-17 Ebedmelech 5663 the Ethiopian, 3569 saying, 559-2 Take 3947-3 from hence thirty 7970 men 582 with thee, 3027 and take up 5927-52 Jeremiah 3414 the prophet 5030 out of the dungeon, 953 before he die. 4191-4

38:11 So Ebedmelech 5663 took 3947-4 the men 582 with him, 3027 and went 935-4 into the house 1004 of the king 4428 under the treasury, 214 and took 3947-4 thence old 1094 cast clouts 5499 and old 1094 rotten rags, 4418 and let them down 7971-17 by cords 2256 into the dungeon 953 to Jeremiah. 3414

38:12 And Ebedmelech 5663 the Ethiopian 3569 said 559-4 unto Jeremiah, 3414 Put 7760-3 now [these] old 1094 cast clouts 5499 and rotten rags 4418 under thine armholes 679 3027 under the cords. 2256 And Jeremiah 3414 did 6213-4 so.

38:13 So they drew 4900-4 up Jeremiah 3414 with cords, 2256 and took him up 5927-55 out of the dungeon: 953 and Jeremiah 3414 remained 3427-4 in the court 2691 of the prison. 4307

38:14 Then Zedekiah 6667 the king 4428 sent, 7971-4 and took 3947-4 Jeremiah 3414 the prophet 5030 unto him into the third 7992 entry 3996 that [is] in the house 1004 of the LORD: 3068 and the king 4428 said 559-4 unto Jeremiah, 3414 I will ask 7592-6 thee a thing; 1697 hide 3582-17 nothing 1697 from me.

38:15 Then Jeremiah 3414 said 559-4 unto Zedekiah, 6667 If I declare 5046-55 [it] unto thee, wilt thou not surely 4191-53 put me to death? 4191-55 and if I give thee counsel, 3289-4 wilt thou not hearken 8085-4 unto me?

38:16 So Zedekiah 6667 the king 4428 sware 7650-11 secretly 5643 unto Jeremiah, 3414 saying, 559-2 [As] the LORD 3068 liveth, 2416 that made 6213-1 us this soul, 5315 I will not put thee to death, 4191-55 neither will I give 5414-4 thee into the hand 3027 of these men 582 that seek 1245-18 thy life. 5315

38:17 Then said 559-4 Jeremiah 3414 unto Zedekiah, 6667 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 the God 430 of hosts, 6635 the God 430 of Israel; 3478 If thou wilt assuredly 3318-2 go forth 3318-4 unto the king 4428 of Babylon's 894 princes, 8269 then thy soul 5315 shall live, 2421-1 and this city 5892 shall not be burned 8313-11 with fire; 784 and thou shalt live, 2421-1 and thine house: 1004

38:18 But if thou wilt not go forth 3318-4 to the king 4428 of Babylon's 894 princes, 8269 then shall this city 5892 be given 5414-8 into the hand 3027 of the Chaldeans, 3778 and they shall burn 8313-1 it with fire, 784 and thou shalt not escape 4422-11 out of their hand. 3027

38:19 And Zedekiah 6667 the king 4428 said 559-4 unto Jeremiah, 3414 I am afraid 1672-6 of the Jews 3064 that are fallen 5307-1 to the Chaldeans, 3778 lest they deliver 5414-4 me into their hand, 3027 and they mock 5953-98 me.

38:20 But Jeremiah 3414 said, 559-4 They shall not deliver 5414-4 [thee]. Obey, 8085-3 I beseech thee, the voice 6963 of the LORD, 3068 which I speak 1696-6 unto thee: so it shall be well 3190-4 unto thee, and thy soul 5315 shall live. 2421-4

38:21 But if thou refuse 3986 to go forth, 3318-2 this [is] the word 1697 that the LORD 3068 hath shewed 7200-52 me:

38:22 And, behold, all the women 802 that are left 7604-8 in the king 4428 of Judah's 3063 house 1004 [shall be] brought forth 3318-94 to the king 4428 of Babylon's 894 princes, 8269 and those [women] shall say, 559-6 Thy friends 582 7965 have set thee on, 5496-52 and have prevailed 3201-1 against thee: thy feet 7272 are sunk 2883-90 in the mire, 1206 [and] they are turned away 5472-8 back. 268

38:23 So they shall bring out 3318-56 all thy wives 802 and thy children 1121 to the Chaldeans: 3778 and thou shalt not escape 4422-11 out of their hand, 3027 but shalt be taken 8610-11 by the hand 3027 of the king 4428 of Babylon: 894 and thou shalt cause this city 5892 to be burned 8313-4 with fire. 784

38:24 Then said 559-4 Zedekiah 6667 unto Jeremiah, 3414 Let no man 376 know 3045-4 of these words, 1697 and thou shalt not die. 4191-4

38:25 But if the princes 8269 hear 8085-4 that I have talked 1696-14 with thee, and they come 935-1 unto thee, and say 559-1 unto thee, Declare 5046-54 unto us now what thou hast said 1696-14 unto the king, 4428 hide 3582-17 it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; 4191-55 also what the king 4428 said 1696-14 unto thee:

38:26 Then thou shalt say 559-1 unto them, I presented 5307-56 my supplication 8467 before 6440 the king, 4428 that he would not cause me to return 7725-53 to Jonathan's 3083 house, 1004 to die 4191-2 there.

38:27 Then came 935-4 all the princes 8269 unto Jeremiah, 3414 and asked 7592-4 him: and he told 5046-55 them according to all these words 1697 that the king 4428 had commanded. 6680-14 So they left off speaking 2790-55 with him; for the matter 1697 was not perceived. 8085-8

38:28 So Jeremiah 3414 abode 3427-4 in the court 2691 of the prison 4307 until the day 3117 that Jerusalem 3389 was taken: 3920-8 and he was [there] when Jerusalem 3389 was taken. 3920-8

39:1 In the ninth 8671 year 8141 of Zedekiah 6667 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 in the tenth 6224 month, 2320 came 935-1 Nebuchadrezzar 5019 king 4428 of Babylon 894 and all his army 2428 against Jerusalem, 3389 and they besieged 6696-4 it.

39:2 [And] in the eleventh 6249 6240 year 8141 of Zedekiah, 6667 in the fourth 7243 month, 2320 the ninth 8672 [day] of the month, 2320 the city 5892 was broken up. 1234-90

39:3 And all the princes 8269 of the king 4428 of Babylon 894 came in, 935-4 and sat 3427-4 in the middle 8432 gate, 8179 [even] Nergalsharezer, 5371 Samgarnebo, 5562 Sarsechim, 8310 Rabsaris, 7249 Nergalsharezer, 5371 Rabmag, 7248 with all the residue 7611 of the princes 8269 of the king 4428 of Babylon. 894

39:4 And it came to pass, [that] when Zedekiah 6667 the king 4428 of Judah 3063 saw 7200-1 them, and all the men 582 of war, 4421 then they fled, 1272-4 and went forth 3318-4 out of the city 5892 by night, 3915 by the way 1870 of the king's 4428 garden, 1588 by the gate 8179 betwixt the two walls: 2346 and he went out 3318-4 the way 1870 of the plain. 6160

39:5 But the Chaldeans' 3778 army 2428 pursued 7291-4 after 310 them, and overtook 5381-55 Zedekiah 6667 in the plains 6160 of Jericho: 3405 and when they had taken 3947-4 him, they brought him up 5927-55 to Nebuchadnezzar 5019 king 4428 of Babylon 894 to Riblah 7247 in the land 776 of Hamath, 2574 where he gave 1696-17 judgment 4941 upon him.

39:6 Then the king 4428 of Babylon 894 slew 7819-4 the sons 1121 of Zedekiah 6667 in Riblah 7247 before his eyes: 5869 also the king 4428 of Babylon 894 slew 7819-1 all the nobles 2715 of Judah. 3063

39:7 Moreover he put out 5786-14 Zedekiah's 6667 eyes, 5869 and bound 631-4 him with chains, 5178 to carry 935-53 him to Babylon. 894

39:8 And the Chaldeans 3778 burned 8313-1 the king's 4428 house, 1004 and the houses 1004 of the people, 5971 with fire, 784 and brake down 5422-1 the walls 2346 of Jerusalem. 3389

39:9 Then Nebuzaradan 5018 the captain 7227 of the guard 2876 carried away captive 1540-52 into Babylon 894 the remnant 3499 of the people 5971 that remained 7604-12 in the city, 5892 and those that fell away, 5307-6 that fell 5307-1 to him, with the rest 3499 of the people 5971 that remained. 7604-12

39:10 But Nebuzaradan 5018 the captain 7227 of the guard 2876 left 7604-52 of the poor 1800 of the people, 5971 which had nothing, 369 3972 in the land 776 of Judah, 3063 and gave 5414-4 them vineyards 3754 and fields 3010 at the same time. 3117

39:11 Now Nebuchadrezzar 5019 king 4428 of Babylon 894 gave charge 6680-17 concerning Jeremiah 3414 to 3027 Nebuzaradan 5018 the captain 7227 of the guard, 2876 saying, 559-2

39:12 Take 3947-3 him, and look well 5869 7760-3 to him, and do 6213-4 him no harm; 3972 7451 but do 6213-3 unto him even as he shall say 1696-17 unto thee.

39:13 So Nebuzaradan 5018 the captain 7227 of the guard 2876 sent, 7971-4 and Nebushasban, 5021 Rabsaris, 7249 and Nergalsharezer, 5371 Rabmag, 7248 and all the king 4428 of Babylon's 894 princes; 7227

39:14 Even they sent, 7971-4 and took 3947-4 Jeremiah 3414 out of the court 2691 of the prison, 4307 and committed 5414-4 him unto Gedaliah 1436 the son 1121 of Ahikam 296 the son 1121 of Shaphan, 8227 that he should carry 3318-53 him home: 1004 so he dwelt 3427-4 among 8432 the people. 5971

39:15 Now the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto Jeremiah, 3414 while he was shut up 6113-7 in the court 2691 of the prison, 4307 saying, 559-2

39:16 Go 1980-2 and speak 559-1 to Ebedmelech 5663 the Ethiopian, 3569 saying, 559-2 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 the God 430 of Israel; 3478 Behold, I will bring 935-56 my words 1697 upon this city 5892 for evil, 7451 and not for good; 2896 and they shall be [accomplished] in that day 3117 before 6440 thee.

39:17 But I will deliver 5337-52 thee in that day, 3117 saith 5002-7 the LORD: 3068 and thou shalt not be given 5414-11 into the hand 3027 of the men 582 of whom 6440 thou [art] afraid. 3016-5

39:18 For I will surely 4422-15 deliver 4422-17 thee, and thou shalt not fall 5307-4 by the sword, 2719 but thy life 5315 shall be for a prey 7998 unto thee: because thou hast put thy trust 982-1 in me, saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

40:1 The word 1697 that came to Jeremiah 3414 from the LORD, 3068 after 310 that Nebuzaradan 5018 the captain 7227 of the guard 2876 had let him go 7971-15 from Ramah, 7414 when he had taken 3947-2 him being bound 631-7 in chains 246 among 8432 all that were carried away captive 1546 of Jerusalem 3389 and Judah, 3063 which were carried away captive 1540-94 unto Babylon. 894

40:2 And the captain 7227 of the guard 2876 took 3947-4 Jeremiah, 3414 and said 559-4 unto him, The LORD 3068 thy God 430 hath pronounced 1696-14 this evil 7451 upon this place. 4725

40:3 Now the LORD 3068 hath brought 935-55 [it], and done 6213-4 according as he hath said: 1696-14 because ye have sinned 2398-1 against the LORD, 3068 and have not obeyed 8085-1 his voice, 6963 therefore this thing 1697 is come upon you.

40:4 And now, behold, I loose 6605-14 thee this day 3117 from the chains 246 which [were] upon thine hand. 3027 If it seem good 2896 5869 unto thee to come 935-2 with me into Babylon, 894 come; 935-3 and I will look well 7760-4 5869 unto thee: but if it seem ill 7489-1 5869 unto thee to come 935-2 with me into Babylon, 894 forbear: 2308-3 behold, 7200-3 all the land 776 [is] before 6440 thee: whither 413 it seemeth good 2896 and convenient 3477 5869 for thee to go, 3212-2 thither go. 3212-3

40:5 Now while he was not yet gone back, 7725-4 [he said], Go back 7725-3 also to Gedaliah 1436 the son 1121 of Ahikam 296 the son 1121 of Shaphan, 8227 whom the king 4428 of Babylon 894 hath made governor 6485-52 over the cities 5892 of Judah, 3063 and dwell 3427-3 with him among 8432 the people: 5971 or go 3212-3 wheresoever it seemeth convenient 3477 5869 unto thee to go. 3212-2 So the captain 7227 of the guard 2876 gave 5414-4 him victuals 737 and a reward, 4864 and let him go. 7971-17

40:6 Then went 935-4 Jeremiah 3414 unto Gedaliah 1436 the son 1121 of Ahikam 296 to Mizpah; 4708 and dwelt 3427-4 with him among 8432 the people 5971 that were left 7604-12 in the land. 776

40:7 Now when all the captains 8269 of the forces 2428 which [were] in the fields, 7704 [even] they and their men, 582 heard 8085-4 that the king 4428 of Babylon 894 had made Gedaliah 1436 the son 1121 of Ahikam 296 governor 6485-52 in the land, 776 and had committed 6485-52 unto him men, 582 and women, 802 and children, 2945 and of the poor 1803 of the land, 776 of them that were not carried away captive 1540-90 to Babylon; 894

40:8 Then they came 935-4 to Gedaliah 1436 to Mizpah, 4708 even Ishmael 3458 the son 1121 of Nethaniah, 5418 and Johanan 3110 and Jonathan 3129 the sons 1121 of Kareah, 7143 and Seraiah 8304 the son 1121 of Tanhumeth, 8576 and the sons 1121 of Ephai 5778 the Netophathite, 5200 and Jezaniah 3153 the son 1121 of a Maachathite, 4602 they and their men. 582

40:9 And Gedaliah 1436 the son 1121 of Ahikam 296 the son 1121 of Shaphan 8227 sware 7650-11 unto them and to their men, 582 saying, 559-2 Fear 3372-4 not to serve 5647-2 the Chaldeans: 3778 dwell 3427-3 in the land, 776 and serve 5647-3 the king 4428 of Babylon, 894 and it shall be well 3190-4 with you.

40:10 As for me, behold, I will dwell 3427-6 at Mizpah 4709 to serve 5975-2 6440 the Chaldeans, 3778 which will come 935-4 unto us: but ye, gather 622-3 ye wine, 3196 and summer fruits, 7019 and oil, 8081 and put 7760-3 [them] in your vessels, 3627 and dwell 3427-3 in your cities 5892 that ye have taken. 8610-1

40:11 Likewise when all the Jews 3064 that [were] in Moab, 4124 and among the Ammonites, 1121 5983 and in Edom, 123 and that [were] in all the countries, 776 heard 8085-1 that the king 4428 of Babylon 894 had left 5414-1 a remnant 7611 of Judah, 3063 and that he had set 6485-52 over them Gedaliah 1436 the son 1121 of Ahikam 296 the son 1121 of Shaphan; 8227

40:12 Even all the Jews 3064 returned 7725-4 out of all places 4725 whither they were driven, 5080-8 and came 935-4 to the land 776 of Judah, 3063 to Gedaliah, 1436 unto Mizpah, 4708 and gathered 622-4 wine 3196 and summer fruits 7019 very 3966 much. 7235-53

40:13 Moreover Johanan 3110 the son 1121 of Kareah, 7143 and all the captains 8269 of the forces 2428 that [were] in the fields, 7704 came 935-1 to Gedaliah 1436 to Mizpah, 4708

40:14 And said 559-4 unto him, Dost thou certainly 3045-2 know 3045-4 that Baalis 1185 the king 4428 of the Ammonites 1121 5983 hath sent 7971-1 Ishmael 3458 the son 1121 of Nethaniah 5418 to slay 5221-53 thee? 5315 But Gedaliah 1436 the son 1121 of Ahikam 296 believed 539-52 them not.

40:15 Then Johanan 3110 the son 1121 of Kareah 7143 spake 559-1 to Gedaliah 1436 in Mizpah 4709 secretly, 5643 saying, 559-2 Let me go, 3212-4 I pray thee, and I will slay 5221-55 Ishmael 3458 the son 1121 of Nethaniah, 5418 and no man 376 shall know 3045-4 [it]: wherefore should he slay 5221-55 thee, 5315 that all the Jews 3063 which are gathered 6908-12 unto thee should be scattered, 6327-8 and the remnant 7611 in Judah 3063 perish? 6-1

40:16 But Gedaliah 1436 the son 1121 of Ahikam 296 said 559-4 unto Johanan 3110 the son 1121 of Kareah, 7143 Thou shalt not do 6213-4 this thing: 1697 for thou speakest 1696-6 falsely 8267 of Ishmael. 3458

41:1 Now it came to pass in the seventh 7637 month, 2320 [that] Ishmael 3458 the son 1121 of Nethaniah 5418 the son 1121 of Elishama, 476 of the seed 2233 royal, 4410 and the princes 7227 of the king, 4428 even ten 6235 men 582 with him, came 935-1 unto Gedaliah 1436 the son 1121 of Ahikam 296 to Mizpah; 4709 and there they did eat 398-4 bread 3899 together 3162 in Mizpah. 4708

41:2 Then arose 6965-4 Ishmael 3458 the son 1121 of Nethaniah, 5418 and the ten 6235 men 582 that were with him, and smote 5221-55 Gedaliah 1436 the son 1121 of Ahikam 296 the son 1121 of Shaphan 8227 with the sword, 2719 and slew 4191-55 him, whom the king 4428 of Babylon 894 had made governor 6485-52 over the land. 776

41:3 Ishmael 3458 also slew 5221-52 all the Jews 3064 that were with him, [even] with Gedaliah, 1436 at Mizpah, 4709 and the Chaldeans 3778 that were found 4672-8 there, [and] the men 582 of war. 4421

41:4 And it came to pass the second 8145 day 3117 after he had slain 4191-53 Gedaliah, 1436 and no man 376 knew 3045-1 [it],

41:5 That there came 935-4 certain 582 from Shechem, 7927 from Shiloh, 7887 and from Samaria, 8111 [even] fourscore 8084 men, 376 having their beards 2206 shaven, 1548-30 and their clothes 899 rent, 7167-7 and having cut 1413-109 themselves, with offerings 4503 and incense 3828 in their hand, 3027 to bring 935-53 [them] to the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068

41:6 And Ishmael 3458 the son 1121 of Nethaniah 5418 went forth 3318-4 from Mizpah 4709 to meet 7125-2 them, weeping 1058-6 all along 1980-2 as he went: 1980-6 and it came to pass, as he met 6298-2 them, he said 559-4 unto them, Come 935-3 to Gedaliah 1436 the son 1121 of Ahikam. 296

41:7 And it was [so], when they came 935-2 into the midst 8432 of the city, 5892 that Ishmael 3458 the son 1121 of Nethaniah 5418 slew 7819-4 them, [and cast them] into the midst 8432 of the pit, 953 he, and the men 582 that [were] with him.

41:8 But ten 6235 men 582 were found 4672-8 among them that said 559-4 unto Ishmael, 3458 Slay 4191-55 us not: for we have 3426 treasures 4301 in the field, 7704 of wheat, 2406 and of barley, 8184 and of oil, 8081 and of honey. 1706 So he forbare, 2308-4 and slew 4191-52 them not among 8432 their brethren. 251

41:9 Now the pit 953 wherein Ishmael 3458 had cast 7993-52 all the dead bodies 6297 of the men, 582 whom he had slain 5221-52 because 3027 of Gedaliah, 1436 [was] it which Asa 609 the king 4428 had made 6213-1 for fear 6440 of Baasha 1201 king 4428 of Israel: 3478 [and] Ishmael 3458 the son 1121 of Nethaniah 5418 filled 4390-14 it with [them that were] slain. 2491

41:10 Then Ishmael 3458 carried away captive 7617-4 all the residue 7611 of the people 5971 that [were] in Mizpah, 4709 [even] the king's 4428 daughters, 1323 and all the people 5971 that remained 7604-12 in Mizpah, 4709 whom Nebuzaradan 5018 the captain 7227 of the guard 2876 had committed 6485-52 to Gedaliah 1436 the son 1121 of Ahikam: 296 and Ishmael 3458 the son 1121 of Nethaniah 5418 carried them away captive, 7617-4 and departed 3212-4 to go over 5674-2 to the Ammonites. 1121 5983

41:11 But when Johanan 3110 the son 1121 of Kareah, 7143 and all the captains 8269 of the forces 2428 that [were] with him, heard 8085-4 of all the evil 7451 that Ishmael 3458 the son 1121 of Nethaniah 5418 had done, 6213-1

41:12 Then they took 3947-4 all the men, 582 and went 3212-4 to fight 3898-9 with Ishmael 3458 the son 1121 of Nethaniah, 5418 and found 4672-4 him by the great 7227 waters 4325 that [are] in Gibeon. 1391

41:13 Now it came to pass, [that] when all the people 5971 which [were] with Ishmael 3458 saw 7200-2 Johanan 3110 the son 1121 of Kareah, 7143 and all the captains 8269 of the forces 2428 that [were] with him, then they were glad. 8055-4

41:14 So all the people 5971 that Ishmael 3458 had carried away captive 7617-1 from Mizpah 4709 cast about 5437-4 and returned, 7725-4 and went 3212-4 unto Johanan 3110 the son 1121 of Kareah. 7143

41:15 But Ishmael 3458 the son 1121 of Nethaniah 5418 escaped 4422-8 from 6440 Johanan 3110 with eight 8083 men, 582 and went 3212-4 to the Ammonites. 1121 5983

41:16 Then took 3947-4 Johanan 3110 the son 1121 of Kareah, 7143 and all the captains 8269 of the forces 2428 that [were] with him, all the remnant 7611 of the people 5971 whom he had recovered 7725-52 from Ishmael 3458 the son 1121 of Nethaniah, 5418 from Mizpah, 4709 after 310 [that] he had slain 5221-52 Gedaliah 1436 the son 1121 of Ahikam, 296 [even] mighty 1397 men 582 of war, 4421 and the women, 802 and the children, 2945 and the eunuchs, 5631 whom he had brought again 7725-52 from Gibeon: 1391

41:17 And they departed, 3212-4 and dwelt 3427-4 in the habitation 1628 of Chimham, 3643 which is by 681 Bethlehem, 1035 to go 3212-2 to enter into 935-2 Egypt, 4714

41:18 Because 6440 of the Chaldeans: 3778 for they were afraid 3372-1 of them, 6440 because Ishmael 3458 the son 1121 of Nethaniah 5418 had slain 5221-52 Gedaliah 1436 the son 1121 of Ahikam, 296 whom the king 4428 of Babylon 894 made governor 6485-52 in the land. 776

42:1 Then all the captains 8269 of the forces, 2428 and Johanan 3110 the son 1121 of Kareah, 7143 and Jezaniah 3153 the son 1121 of Hoshaiah, 1955 and all the people 5971 from the least 6996 even unto the greatest, 1419 came near, 5066-4

42:2 And said 559-4 unto Jeremiah 3414 the prophet, 5030 Let, we beseech thee, our supplication 8467 be accepted 5307-4 before 6440 thee, and pray 6419-100 for us unto the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 [even] for all this remnant; 7611 (for we are left 7604-8 [but] a few 4592 of many, 7235-53 as thine eyes 5869 do behold 7200-6 us:)

42:3 That the LORD 3068 thy God 430 may shew 5046-55 us the way 1870 wherein we may walk, 3212-4 and the thing 1697 that we may do. 6213-4

42:4 Then Jeremiah 3414 the prophet 5030 said 559-4 unto them, I have heard 8085-1 [you]; behold, I will pray 6419-102 unto the LORD 3068 your God 430 according to your words; 1697 and it shall come to pass, [that] whatsoever thing 1697 the LORD 3068 shall answer 6030-4 you, I will declare 5046-55 [it] unto you; I will keep nothing 1697 back 4513-4 from you.

42:5 Then they said 559-1 to Jeremiah, 3414 The LORD 3068 be a true 571 and faithful 539-12 witness 5707 between us, if we do 6213-4 not even according to all things 1697 for the which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 shall send 7971-4 thee to us.

42:6 Whether [it be] good, 2896 or whether [it be] evil, 7451 we will obey 8085-4 the voice 6963 of the LORD 3068 our God, 430 to whom we 580 send 7971-6 thee; that it may be well 3190-4 with us, when we obey 8085-4 the voice 6963 of the LORD 3068 our God. 430

42:7 And it came to pass after 7093 ten 6235 days, 3117 that the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto Jeremiah. 3414

42:8 Then called 7121-4 he Johanan 3110 the son 1121 of Kareah, 7143 and all the captains 8269 of the forces 2428 which [were] with him, and all the people 5971 from the least 6996 even to the greatest, 1419

42:9 And said 559-4 unto them, Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 the God 430 of Israel, 3478 unto whom ye sent 7971-1 me to present 5307-53 your supplication 8467 before 6440 him;

42:10 If ye will still 7725-2 abide 3427-4 in this land, 776 then will I build 1129-1 you, and not pull [you] down, 2040-4 and I will plant 5193-1 you, and not pluck [you] up: 5428-4 for I repent 5162-8 me of the evil 7451 that I have done 6213-1 unto you.

42:11 Be not afraid 3372-4 of 6440 the king 4428 of Babylon, 894 of whom 6440 ye are afraid; 3373 be not afraid 3372-4 of him, saith 5002-7 the LORD: 3068 for I [am] with you to save 3467-53 you, and to deliver 5337-53 you from his hand. 3027

42:12 And I will shew 5414-4 mercies 7356 unto you, that he may have mercy 7355-14 upon you, and cause you to return 7725-52 to your own land. 127

42:13 But if ye say, 559-6 We will not dwell 3427-4 in this land, 776 neither obey 8085-2 the voice 6963 of the LORD 3068 your God, 430

42:14 Saying, 559-2 No; but we will go 935-4 into the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 where we shall see 7200-4 no war, 4421 nor hear 8085-4 the sound 6963 of the trumpet, 7782 nor have hunger 7456-4 of bread; 3899 and there will we dwell: 3427-4

42:15 And now therefore hear 8085-3 the word 1697 of the LORD, 3068 ye remnant 7611 of Judah; 3063 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 the God 430 of Israel; 3478 If ye wholly 7760-2 set 7760-4 your faces 6440 to enter into 935-2 Egypt, 4714 and go 935-1 to sojourn 1481-2 there;

42:16 Then it shall come to pass, [that] the sword, 2719 which ye feared, 3373 shall overtake 5381-55 you there in the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 and the famine, 7458 whereof ye were afraid, 1672-6 shall follow close 1692-4 after 310 you there in Egypt; 4714 and there ye shall die. 4191-4

42:17 So shall it be with all the men 582 that set 7760-1 their faces 6440 to go into 935-2 Egypt 4714 to sojourn 1481-2 there; they shall die 4191-4 by the sword, 2719 by the famine, 7458 and by the pestilence: 1698 and none of them shall remain 8300 or escape 6412 from 6440 the evil 7451 that I will bring 935-56 upon them.

42:18 For thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 the God 430 of Israel; 3478 As mine anger 639 and my fury 2534 hath been poured forth 5413-8 upon the inhabitants 3427-6 of Jerusalem; 3389 so shall my fury 2534 be poured forth 5413-4 upon you, when ye shall enter into 935-2 Egypt: 4714 and ye shall be an execration, 423 and an astonishment, 8047 and a curse, 7045 and a reproach; 2781 and ye shall see 7200-4 this place 4725 no more.

42:19 The LORD 3068 hath said 1696-14 concerning you, O ye remnant 7611 of Judah; 3063 Go 935-4 ye not into Egypt: 4714 know 3045-4 certainly 3045-2 that I have admonished 5749-52 you this day. 3117

42:20 For ye dissembled 8582-52 in your hearts, 5315 when ye sent 7971-1 me unto the LORD 3068 your God, 430 saying, 559-2 Pray 6419-100 for us unto the LORD 3068 our God; 430 and according unto all that the LORD 3068 our God 430 shall say, 559-4 so declare 5046-54 unto us, and we will do 6213-1 [it].

42:21 And [now] I have this day 3117 declared 5046-55 [it] to you; but ye have not obeyed 8085-1 the voice 6963 of the LORD 3068 your God, 430 nor any [thing] for the which he hath sent 7971-1 me unto you.

42:22 Now therefore know 3045-4 certainly 3045-2 that ye shall die 4191-4 by the sword, 2719 by the famine, 7458 and by the pestilence, 1698 in the place 4725 whither ye desire 2654-1 to go 935-2 [and] to sojourn. 1481-2

43:1 And it came to pass, [that] when Jeremiah 3414 had made an end 3615-15 of speaking 1696-15 unto all the people 5971 all the words 1697 of the LORD 3068 their God, 430 for which the LORD 3068 their God 430 had sent 7971-1 him to them, [even] all these words, 1697

43:2 Then spake 559-4 Azariah 5838 the son 1121 of Hoshaiah, 1955 and Johanan 3110 the son 1121 of Kareah, 7143 and all the proud 2086 men, 582 saying 559-6 unto Jeremiah, 3414 Thou speakest 1696-18 falsely: 8267 the LORD 3068 our God 430 hath not sent 7971-1 thee to say, 559-2 Go 935-4 not into Egypt 4714 to sojourn 1481-2 there:

43:3 But Baruch 1263 the son 1121 of Neriah 5374 setteth 5496-56 thee on against us, for to 4616 deliver 5414-2 us into the hand 3027 of the Chaldeans, 3778 that they might put us to death, 4191-53 and carry us away captives 1540-53 into Babylon. 894

43:4 So Johanan 3110 the son 1121 of Kareah, 7143 and all the captains 8269 of the forces, 2428 and all the people, 5971 obeyed 8085-1 not the voice 6963 of the LORD, 3068 to dwell 3427-2 in the land 776 of Judah. 3063

43:5 But Johanan 3110 the son 1121 of Kareah, 7143 and all the captains 8269 of the forces, 2428 took 3947-4 all the remnant 7611 of Judah, 3063 that were returned 7725-1 from all nations, 1471 whither they had been driven, 5080-8 to dwell 1481-2 in the land 776 of Judah; 3063

43:6 [Even] men, 1397 and women, 802 and children, 2945 and the king's 4428 daughters, 1323 and every person 5315 that Nebuzaradan 5018 the captain 7227 of the guard 2876 had left 3240-52 with Gedaliah 1436 the son 1121 of Ahikam 296 the son 1121 of Shaphan, 8227 and Jeremiah 3414 the prophet, 5030 and Baruch 1263 the son 1121 of Neriah. 5374

43:7 So they came 935-4 into the land 776 of Egypt: 4714 for they obeyed 8085-1 not the voice 6963 of the LORD: 3068 thus came 935-4 they [even] to Tahpanhes. 8471

43:8 Then came the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 unto Jeremiah 3414 in Tahpanhes, 8471 saying, 559-2

43:9 Take 3947-3 great 1419 stones 68 in thine hand, 3027 and hide 2934-1 them in the clay 4423 in the brickkiln, 4404 which [is] at the entry 6607 of Pharaoh's 6547 house 1004 in Tahpanhes, 8471 in the sight 5869 of the men 582 of Judah; 3064

43:10 And say 559-1 unto them, Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 the God 430 of Israel; 3478 Behold, I will send 7971-6 and take 3947-1 Nebuchadrezzar 5019 the king 4428 of Babylon, 894 my servant, 5650 and will set 7760-1 his throne 3678 upon 4605 these stones 68 that I have hid; 2934-1 and he shall spread 5186-1 his royal pavilion 8237 over them.

43:11 And when he cometh, 935-1 he shall smite 5221-52 the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 [and deliver] such [as are] for death 4194 to death; 4194 and such [as are] for captivity 7628 to captivity; 7628 and such [as are] for the sword 2719 to the sword. 2719

43:12 And I will kindle 3341-52 a fire 784 in the houses 1004 of the gods 430 of Egypt; 4714 and he shall burn 8313-1 them, and carry them away captives: 7617-1 and he shall array 5844-1 himself with the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 as a shepherd 7462-6 putteth on 5844-4 his garment; 899 and he shall go forth 3318-1 from thence in peace. 7965

43:13 He shall break 7665-14 also the images 4676 of Bethshemesh, 1053 that [is] in the land 776 of Egypt; 4714 and the houses 1004 of the gods 430 of the Egyptians 4714 shall he burn 8313-4 with fire. 784

44:1 The word 1697 that came to Jeremiah 3414 concerning all the Jews 3064 which dwell 3427-6 in the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 which dwell 3427-6 at Migdol, 4024 and at Tahpanhes, 8471 and at Noph, 5297 and in the country 776 of Pathros, 6624 saying, 559-2

44:2 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 the God 430 of Israel; 3478 Ye have seen 7200-1 all the evil 7451 that I have brought 935-52 upon Jerusalem, 3389 and upon all the cities 5892 of Judah; 3063 and, behold, this day 3117 they [are] a desolation, 2723 and no man dwelleth 3427-6 therein,

44:3 Because 6440 of their wickedness 7451 which they have committed 6213-1 to provoke me to anger, 3707-53 in that they went 3212-2 to burn incense, 6999-15 [and] to serve 5647-2 other 312 gods, 430 whom they knew 3045-1 not, [neither] they, ye, nor your fathers. 1

44:4 Howbeit I sent 7971-4 unto you all my servants 5650 the prophets, 5030 rising early 7925-53 and sending 7971-2 [them], saying, 559-2 Oh, do 6213-4 not this abominable 8441 thing 1697 that I hate. 8130-1

44:5 But they hearkened 8085-1 not, nor inclined 5186-52 their ear 241 to turn 7725-2 from their wickedness, 7451 to burn no incense 6999-15 unto other 312 gods. 430

44:6 Wherefore my fury 2534 and mine anger 639 was poured forth, 5413-4 and was kindled 1197-4 in the cities 5892 of Judah 3063 and in the streets 2351 of Jerusalem; 3389 and they are wasted 2723 [and] desolate, 8077 as at this day. 3117

44:7 Therefore now thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 the God 430 of hosts, 6635 the God 430 of Israel; 3478 Wherefore commit 6213-6 ye [this] great 1419 evil 7451 against your souls, 5315 to cut off 3772-53 from you man 376 and woman, 802 child 5768 and suckling, 3243-6 out 8432 of Judah, 3063 to leave 3498-53 you none to remain; 7611

44:8 In that ye provoke me unto wrath 3707-53 with the works 4639 of your hands, 3027 burning incense 6999-15 unto other 312 gods 430 in the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 whither ye be gone 935-6 to dwell, 1481-2 that ye might cut yourselves off, 3772-53 and that ye might be a curse 7045 and a reproach 2781 among all the nations 1471 of the earth? 776

44:9 Have ye forgotten 7911-1 the wickedness 7451 of your fathers, 1 and the wickedness 7451 of the kings 4428 of Judah, 3063 and the wickedness 7451 of their wives, 802 and your own wickedness, 7451 and the wickedness 7451 of your wives, 802 which they have committed 6213-1 in the land 776 of Judah, 3063 and in the streets 2351 of Jerusalem? 3389

44:10 They are not humbled 1792-27 [even] unto this day, 3117 neither have they feared, 3372-1 nor walked 1980-1 in my law, 8451 nor in my statutes, 2708 that I set 5414-1 before 6440 you and before 6440 your fathers. 1

44:11 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 the God 430 of Israel; 3478 Behold, I will set 7760-6 my face 6440 against you for evil, 7451 and to cut off 3772-53 all Judah. 3063

44:12 And I will take 3947-1 the remnant 7611 of Judah, 3063 that have set 7760-1 their faces 6440 to go into 935-2 the land 776 of Egypt 4714 to sojourn 1481-2 there, and they shall all be consumed, 8552-1 [and] fall 5307-4 in the land 776 of Egypt; 4714 they shall [even] be consumed 8552-11 by the sword 2719 [and] by the famine: 7458 they shall die, 4191-4 from the least 6996 even unto the greatest, 1419 by the sword 2719 and by the famine: 7458 and they shall be an execration, 423 [and] an astonishment, 8047 and a curse, 7045 and a reproach. 2781

44:13 For I will punish 6485-1 them that dwell 3427-6 in the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 as I have punished 6485-1 Jerusalem, 3389 by the sword, 2719 by the famine, 7458 and by the pestilence: 1698

44:14 So that none of the remnant 7611 of Judah, 3063 which are gone 935-6 into the land 776 of Egypt 4714 to sojourn 1481-2 there, shall escape 6412 or remain, 8300 that they should return 7725-2 into the land 776 of Judah, 3063 to the which they have 5375-18 a desire 5315 to return 7725-2 to dwell 3427-2 there: for none shall return 7725-4 but such as shall escape. 6405

44:15 Then all the men 582 which knew 3045-6 that their wives 802 had burned incense 6999-18 unto other 312 gods, 430 and all the women 802 that stood by, 5975-6 a great 1419 multitude, 6951 even all the people 5971 that dwelt 3427-6 in the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 in Pathros, 6624 answered 6030-4 Jeremiah, 3414 saying, 559-2

44:16 [As for] the word 1697 that thou hast spoken 1696-14 unto us in the name 8034 of the LORD, 3068 we will not hearken 8085-6 unto thee.

44:17 But we will certainly 6213-2 do 6213-4 whatsoever thing 1697 goeth forth 3318-1 out of our own mouth, 6310 to burn incense 6999-15 unto the queen 4446 of heaven, 8064 and to pour out 5258-53 drink offerings 5262 unto her, as we have done, 6213-1 we, and our fathers, 1 our kings, 4428 and our princes, 8269 in the cities 5892 of Judah, 3063 and in the streets 2351 of Jerusalem: 3389 for [then] had we plenty 7646-4 of victuals, 3899 and were well, 2896 and saw 7200-1 no evil. 7451

44:18 But since we left off 2308-1 to burn incense 6999-15 to the queen 4446 of heaven, 8064 and to pour out 5258-53 drink offerings 5262 unto her, we have wanted 2637-1 all [things], and have been consumed 8552-1 by the sword 2719 and by the famine. 7458

44:19 And when we burned incense 6999-18 to the queen 4446 of heaven, 8064 and poured out 5258-53 drink offerings 5262 unto her, did we make 6213-1 her cakes 3561 to worship 6087-53 her, and pour out 5258-53 drink offerings 5262 unto her, without 1107 our men? 582

44:20 Then Jeremiah 3414 said 559-4 unto all the people, 5971 to the men, 1397 and to the women, 802 and to all the people 5971 which had given him [that] answer, 1697 6030-6 saying, 559-2

44:21 The incense 7002 that ye burned 6999-14 in the cities 5892 of Judah, 3063 and in the streets 2351 of Jerusalem, 3389 ye, and your fathers, 1 your kings, 4428 and your princes, 8269 and the people 5971 of the land, 776 did not the LORD 3068 remember 2142-1 them, and came 5927-4 it [not] into his mind? 3820

44:22 So that the LORD 3068 could 3201-4 no longer bear, 5375-2 because 6440 of the evil 7455 of your doings, 4611 [and] because 6440 of the abominations 8441 which ye have committed; 6213-1 therefore is your land 776 a desolation, 2723 and an astonishment, 8047 and a curse, 7045 without an inhabitant, 3427-6 as at this day. 3117

44:23 Because 6440 834 ye have burned incense, 6999-14 and because ye have sinned 2398-1 against the LORD, 3068 and have not obeyed 8085-1 the voice 6963 of the LORD, 3068 nor walked 1980-1 in his law, 8451 nor in his statutes, 2708 nor in his testimonies; 5715 therefore this evil 7451 is happened 7122-1 unto you, as at this day. 3117

44:24 Moreover Jeremiah 3414 said 559-4 unto all the people, 5971 and to all the women, 802 Hear 8085-3 the word 1697 of the LORD, 3068 all Judah 3063 that [are] in the land 776 of Egypt: 4714

44:25 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 the God 430 of Israel, 3478 saying; 559-2 Ye and your wives 802 have both spoken 1696-17 with your mouths, 6310 and fulfilled 4390-14 with your hand, 3027 saying, 559-2 We will surely 6213-2 perform 6213-4 our vows 5088 that we have vowed, 5087-1 to burn incense 6999-15 to the queen 4446 of heaven, 8064 and to pour out 5258-53 drink offerings 5262 unto her: ye will surely 6965-53 accomplish 6965-55 your vows, 5088 and surely 6213-2 perform 6213-4 your vows. 5088

44:26 Therefore hear 8085-3 ye the word 1697 of the LORD, 3068 all Judah 3063 that dwell 3427-6 in the land 776 of Egypt; 4714 Behold, I have sworn 7650-8 by my great 1419 name, 8034 saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 that my name 8034 shall no more be named 7121-12 in the mouth 6310 of any man 376 of Judah 3063 in all the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 saying, 559-6 The Lord 136 GOD 3069 liveth. 2416

44:27 Behold, I will watch 8245-6 over them for evil, 7451 and not for good: 2896 and all the men 376 of Judah 3063 that [are] in the land 776 of Egypt 4714 shall be consumed 8552-1 by the sword 2719 and by the famine, 7458 until there be an end 3615-2 of them.

44:28 Yet a small 4962 number 4557 that escape 6412 the sword 2719 shall return 7725-4 out of the land 776 of Egypt 4714 into the land 776 of Judah, 3063 and all the remnant 7611 of Judah, 3063 that are gone 935-6 into the land 776 of Egypt 4714 to sojourn 1481-2 there, shall know 3045-1 whose words 1697 shall stand, 6965-4 mine, or theirs.

44:29 And this [shall be] a sign 226 unto you, saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 that I will punish 6485-6 you in this place, 4725 that ye may know 3045-4 that my words 1697 shall surely 6965-2 stand 6965-4 against you for evil: 7451

44:30 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 Behold, I will give 5414-6 Pharaohhophra 6548 king 4428 of Egypt 4714 into the hand 3027 of his enemies, 341-6 and into the hand 3027 of them that seek 1245-18 his life; 5315 as I gave 5414-1 Zedekiah 6667 king 4428 of Judah 3063 into the hand 3027 of Nebuchadrezzar 5019 king 4428 of Babylon, 894 his enemy, 341-6 and that sought 1245-18 his life. 5315

45:1 The word 1697 that Jeremiah 3414 the prophet 5030 spake 1696-14 unto Baruch 1263 the son 1121 of Neriah, 5374 when he had written 3789-2 these words 1697 in a book 5612 at the mouth 6310 of Jeremiah, 3414 in the fourth 7243 year 8141 of Jehoiakim 3079 the son 1121 of Josiah 2977 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 saying, 559-2

45:2 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 the God 430 of Israel, 3478 unto thee, O Baruch; 1263

45:3 Thou didst say, 559-1 Woe 188 is me now! for the LORD 3068 hath added 3254-1 grief 3015 to my sorrow; 4341 I fainted 3021-1 in my sighing, 585 and I find 4672-1 no rest. 4496

45:4 Thus shalt thou say 559-4 unto him, The LORD 3068 saith 559-1 thus; Behold, [that] which I have built 1129-1 will I break down, 2040-6 and that which I have planted 5193-1 I will pluck up, 5428-6 even this whole land. 776

45:5 And seekest 1245-17 thou great things 1419 for thyself? seek 1245-17 [them] not: for, behold, I will bring 935-56 evil 7451 upon all flesh, 1320 saith 5002-7 the LORD: 3068 but thy life 5315 will I give 5414-1 unto thee for a prey 7998 in all places 4725 whither thou goest. 3212-4

46:1 The word 1697 of the LORD 3068 which came to Jeremiah 3414 the prophet 5030 against the Gentiles; 1471

46:2 Against Egypt, 4714 against the army 2428 of Pharaohnecho 6549 king 4428 of Egypt, 4714 which was by the river 5104 Euphrates 6578 in Carchemish, 3751 which Nebuchadrezzar 5019 king 4428 of Babylon 894 smote 5221-52 in the fourth 7243 year 8141 of Jehoiakim 3079 the son 1121 of Josiah 2977 king 4428 of Judah. 3063

46:3 Order 6186-3 ye the buckler 4043 and shield, 6793 and draw near 5066-3 to battle. 4421

46:4 Harness 631-3 the horses; 5483 and get up, 5927-3 ye horsemen, 6571 and stand forth 3320-100 with [your] helmets; 3553 furbish 4838-3 the spears, 7420 [and] put on 3847-3 the brigandines. 5630

46:5 Wherefore have I seen 7200-1 them dismayed 2844 [and] turned away 5472-12 back? 268 and their mighty ones 1368 are beaten down, 3807-93 and are fled 5127-1 apace, 4498 and look not back: 6437-52 [for] fear 4032 [was] round about, 5439 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

46:6 Let not the swift 7031 flee away, 5127-4 nor the mighty man 1368 escape; 4422-11 they shall stumble, 3782-1 and fall 5307-1 toward the north 6828 by 3027 the river 5104 Euphrates. 6578

46:7 Who [is] this [that] cometh up 5927-4 as a flood, 2975 whose waters 4325 are moved 1607-101 as the rivers? 5104

46:8 Egypt 4714 riseth up 5927-4 like a flood, 2975 and [his] waters 4325 are moved 1607-108 like the rivers; 5104 and he saith, 559-4 I will go up, 5927-4 [and] will cover 3680-17 the earth; 776 I will destroy 6-55 the city 5892 and the inhabitants 3427-6 thereof.

46:9 Come up, 5927-3 ye horses; 5483 and rage, 1984-107 ye chariots; 7393 and let the mighty men 1368 come forth; 3318-4 the Ethiopians 3568 and the Libyans, 6316 that handle 8610-6 the shield; 4043 and the Lydians, 3866 that handle 8610-6 [and] bend 1869-6 the bow. 7198

46:10 For this [is] the day 3117 of the Lord 136 GOD 3069 of hosts, 6635 a day 3117 of vengeance, 5360 that he may avenge 5358-9 him of his adversaries: 6862 and the sword 2719 shall devour, 398-1 and it shall be satiate 7646-1 and made drunk 7301-1 with their blood: 1818 for the Lord 136 GOD 3069 of hosts 6635 hath a sacrifice 2077 in the north 6828 country 776 by the river 5104 Euphrates. 6578

46:11 Go up 5927-3 into Gilead, 1568 and take 3947-3 balm, 6875 O virgin, 1330 the daughter 1323 of Egypt: 4714 in vain 7723 shalt thou use many 7235-52 medicines; 7499 [for] thou shalt not be cured. 8585

46:12 The nations 1471 have heard 8085-1 of thy shame, 7036 and thy cry 6682 hath filled 4390-1 the land: 776 for the mighty man 1368 hath stumbled 3782-1 against the mighty, 1368 [and] they are fallen 5307-1 both 8147 together. 3162

46:13 The word 1697 that the LORD 3068 spake 1696-14 to Jeremiah 3414 the prophet, 5030 how Nebuchadrezzar 5019 king 4428 of Babylon 894 should come 935-2 [and] smite 5221-53 the land 776 of Egypt. 4714

46:14 Declare 5046-54 ye in Egypt, 4714 and publish 8085-54 in Migdol, 4024 and publish 8085-54 in Noph 5297 and in Tahpanhes: 8471 say 559-3 ye, Stand fast, 3320-100 and prepare 3559-54 thee; for the sword 2719 shall devour 398-1 round about 5439 thee.

46:15 Why are thy valiant 47 [men] swept away? 5502-8 they stood 5975-1 not, because the LORD 3068 did drive 1920-1 them.

46:16 He made many 7235-52 to fall, 3782-6 yea, one 376 fell 5307-1 upon another: 7453 and they said, 559-4 Arise, 6965-3 and let us go again 7725-4 to our own people, 5971 and to the land 776 of our nativity, 4138 from 6440 the oppressing 3238-6 sword. 2719

46:17 They did cry 7121-1 there, Pharaoh 6547 king 4428 of Egypt 4714 [is but] a noise; 7588 he hath passed 5674-52 the time appointed. 4150

46:18 [As] I live, 2416 saith 5002-7 the King, 4428 whose name 8034 [is] the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 Surely as Tabor 8396 [is] among the mountains, 2022 and as Carmel 3760 by the sea, 3220 [so] shall he come. 935-4

46:19 O thou daughter 1323 dwelling 3427-6 in Egypt, 4714 furnish 6213-3 thyself 3627 to go into captivity: 1473 for Noph 5297 shall be waste 8047 and desolate 3341-8 without an inhabitant. 3427-6

46:20 Egypt 4714 [is like] a very fair 3304 heifer, 5697 [but] destruction 7171 cometh; 935-1 it cometh 935-1 out of the north. 6828

46:21 Also her hired 7916 men [are] in the midst 7130 of her like fatted 4770 bullocks; 5695 for they also are turned back, 6437-52 [and] are fled away 5127-1 together: 3162 they did not stand, 5975-1 because the day 3117 of their calamity 343 was come 935-1 upon them, [and] the time 6256 of their visitation. 6486

46:22 The voice 6963 thereof shall go 3212-4 like a serpent; 5175 for they shall march 3212-4 with an army, 2428 and come 935-1 against her with axes, 7134 as hewers 2404-6 of wood. 6086

46:23 They shall cut down 3772-1 her forest, 3293 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 though it cannot be searched; 2713-11 because they are more 7231-1 than the grasshoppers, 697 and [are] innumerable. 369 4557

46:24 The daughter 1323 of Egypt 4714 shall be confounded; 3001-52 she shall be delivered 5414-8 into the hand 3027 of the people 5971 of the north. 6828

46:25 The LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 the God 430 of Israel, 3478 saith; 559-1 Behold, I will punish 6485-6 the multitude 527|528-q of No, 4996 and Pharaoh, 6547 and Egypt, 4714 with their gods, 430 and their kings; 4428 even Pharaoh, 6547 and [all] them that trust 982-6 in him:

46:26 And I will deliver 5414-1 them into the hand 3027 of those that seek 1245-18 their lives, 5315 and into the hand 3027 of Nebuchadrezzar 5019 king 4428 of Babylon, 894 and into the hand 3027 of his servants: 5650 and afterward 310 it shall be inhabited, 7931-4 as in the days 3117 of old, 6924 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

46:27 But fear 3372-4 not thou, O my servant 5650 Jacob, 3290 and be not dismayed, 2865-11 O Israel: 3478 for, behold, I will save 3467-56 thee from afar off, 7350 and thy seed 2233 from the land 776 of their captivity; 7628 and Jacob 3290 shall return, 7725-1 and be in rest 8252-1 and at ease, 7599-40 and none shall make [him] afraid. 2729-56

46:28 Fear 3372-4 thou not, O Jacob 3290 my servant, 5650 saith 5002-7 the LORD: 3068 for I [am] with thee; for I will make 6213-4 a full end 3617 of all the nations 1471 whither I have driven 5080-52 thee: but I will not make 6213-4 a full end 3617 of thee, but correct 3256-14 thee in measure; 4941 yet will I not leave thee wholly 5352-15 unpunished. 5352-17

47:1 The word 1697 of the LORD 3068 that came to Jeremiah 3414 the prophet 5030 against the Philistines, 6430 before that Pharaoh 6547 smote 5221-55 Gaza. 5804

47:2 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 Behold, waters 4325 rise up 5927-6 out of the north, 6828 and shall be an overflowing 7857-6 flood, 5158 and shall overflow 7857-4 the land, 776 and all that is therein; 4393 the city, 5892 and them that dwell 3427-6 therein: then the men 120 shall cry, 2199-1 and all the inhabitants 3427-6 of the land 776 shall howl. 3213-52

47:3 At the noise 6963 of the stamping 8161 of the hoofs 6541 of his strong 47 [horses], at the rushing 7494 of his chariots, 7393 [and at] the rumbling 1995 of his wheels, 1534 the fathers 1 shall not look back 6437-52 to [their] children 1121 for feebleness 7510 of hands; 3027

47:4 Because of the day 3117 that cometh 935-6 to spoil 7703-2 all the Philistines, 6430 [and] to cut off 3772-53 from Tyrus 6865 and Zidon 6721 every helper 5826-6 that remaineth: 8300 for the LORD 3068 will spoil 7703-6 the Philistines, 6430 the remnant 7611 of the country 339 of Caphtor. 3731

47:5 Baldness 7144 is come 935-1 upon Gaza; 5804 Ashkelon 831 is cut off 1820-8 [with] the remnant 7611 of their valley: 6010 how long wilt thou cut 1413-108 thyself?

47:6 O 1945 thou sword 2719 of the LORD, 3068 how long [will it be] ere 3808 thou be quiet? 8252-4 put up 622-10 thyself into thy scabbard, 8593 rest, 7280-10 and be still. 1826-3

47:7 How can it be quiet, 8252-4 seeing the LORD 3068 hath given it a charge 6680-14 against Ashkelon, 831 and against the sea 3220 shore? 2348 there hath he appointed 3259-1 it.

48:1 Against Moab 4124 thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 the God 430 of Israel; 3478 Woe 1945 unto Nebo! 5015 for it is spoiled: 7703-27 Kiriathaim 7156 is confounded 3001-52 [and] taken: 3920-8 Misgab 4869 is confounded 3001-52 and dismayed. 2865-1

48:2 [There shall be] no more praise 8416 of Moab: 4124 in Heshbon 2809 they have devised 2803-1 evil 7451 against it; come, 3212-3 and let us cut it off 3772-55 from [being] a nation. 1471 Also thou shalt be cut down, 1826-11 O Madmen; 4086 the sword 2719 shall pursue 3212-4 310 thee.

48:3 A voice 6963 of crying 6818 [shall be] from Horonaim, 2773 spoiling 7701 and great 1419 destruction. 7667

48:4 Moab 4124 is destroyed; 7665-8 her little ones 6810 have caused a cry 2201 to be heard. 8085-52

48:5 For in the going up 4608 of Luhith 3872 continual 1065 weeping 1065 shall go up; 5927-4 for in the going down 4174 of Horonaim 2773 the enemies 6862 have heard 8085-1 a cry 6818 of destruction. 7667

48:6 Flee, 5127-3 save 4422-16 your lives, 5315 and be 1961-4 like the heath 6176 in the wilderness. 4057

48:7 For because thou hast trusted 982-2 in thy works 4639 and in thy treasures, 214 thou shalt also be taken: 3920-11 and Chemosh 3645 shall go forth 3318-1 into captivity 1473 [with] his priests 3548 and his princes 8269 together. 3162

48:8 And the spoiler 7703-6 shall come 935-4 upon every city, 5892 and no city 5892 shall escape: 4422-11 the valley 6010 also shall perish, 6-1 and the plain 4334 shall be destroyed, 8045-8 as the LORD 3068 hath spoken. 559-1

48:9 Give 5414-3 wings 6731 unto Moab, 4124 that it may flee 5323-2 and get away: 3318-4 for the cities 5892 thereof shall be desolate, 8047 without any to dwell 3427-6 therein. 2004

48:10 Cursed 779-7 [be] he that doeth 6213-6 the work 4399 of the LORD 3068 deceitfully, 7423 and cursed 779-7 [be] he that keepeth back 4513-6 his sword 2719 from blood. 1818

48:11 Moab 4124 hath been at ease 7599-40 from his youth, 5271 and he hath settled 8252-6 on his lees, 8105 and hath not been emptied 7324-90 from vessel 3627 to vessel, 3627 neither hath he gone 1980-1 into captivity: 1473 therefore his taste 2940 remained 5975-1 in him, and his scent 7381 is not changed. 4171-8

48:12 Therefore, behold, the days 3117 come, 935-6 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 that I will send 7971-14 unto him wanderers, 6808-6 that shall cause him to wander, 6808-14 and shall empty 7324-55 his vessels, 3627 and break 5310-17 their bottles. 5035

48:13 And Moab 4124 shall be ashamed 954-1 of Chemosh, 3645 as the house 1004 of Israel 3478 was ashamed 954-1 of Bethel 1008 their confidence. 4009

48:14 How say 559-4 ye, We [are] mighty 1368 and strong 2428 men 582 for the war? 4421

48:15 Moab 4124 is spoiled, 7703-27 and gone up 5927-1 [out of] her cities, 5892 and his chosen 4005 young men 970 are gone down 3381-1 to the slaughter, 2874 saith 5002-7 the King, 4428 whose name 8034 [is] the LORD 3068 of hosts. 6635

48:16 The calamity 343 of Moab 4124 [is] near 7138 to come, 935-2 and his affliction 7451 hasteth 4116-14 fast. 3966

48:17 All ye that are about 5439 him, bemoan 5110-3 him; and all ye that know 3045-6 his name, 8034 say, 559-3 How is the strong 5797 staff 4294 broken, 7665-8 [and] the beautiful 8597 rod! 4731

48:18 Thou daughter 1323 that dost inhabit 3427-6 Dibon, 1769 come down 3381-3 from [thy] glory, 3519 and sit 3427-3|3427-6-k in thirst; 6772 for the spoiler 7703-6 of Moab 4124 shall come 5927-1 upon thee, [and] he shall destroy 7843-14 thy strong holds. 4013

48:19 O inhabitant 3427-6 of Aroer, 6177 stand 5975-3 by the way, 1870 and espy; 6822-16 ask 7592-3 him that fleeth, 5127-5 and her that escapeth, 4422-12 [and] say, 559-3 What is done? 1961-8

48:20 Moab 4124 is confounded; 3001-52 for it is broken down: 2865-1 howl 3213-54 and cry; 2199-3 tell 5046-54 ye it in Arnon, 769 that Moab 4124 is spoiled, 7703-27

48:21 And judgment 4941 is come 935-1 upon the plain 4334 country; 776 upon Holon, 2473 and upon Jahazah, 3096 and upon Mephaath, 4158

48:22 And upon Dibon, 1769 and upon Nebo, 5015 and upon Bethdiblathaim, 1015

48:23 And upon Kiriathaim, 7156 and upon Bethgamul, 1014 and upon Bethmeon, 1010

48:24 And upon Kerioth, 7152 and upon Bozrah, 1224 and upon all the cities 5892 of the land 776 of Moab, 4124 far 7350 or near. 7138

48:25 The horn 7161 of Moab 4124 is cut off, 1438-8 and his arm 2220 is broken, 7665-8 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

48:26 Make ye him drunken: 7937-54 for he magnified 1431-52 [himself] against the LORD: 3068 Moab 4124 also shall wallow 5606-1 in his vomit, 6892 and he also shall be in derision. 7814

48:27 For was not Israel 3478 a derision 7814 unto thee? was he found 4672-8 among thieves? 1590 for since 1767 thou spakest 1697 of him, thou skippedst 5110-113 for joy.

48:28 O ye that dwell 3427-6 in Moab, 4124 leave 5800-3 the cities, 5892 and dwell 7931-3 in the rock, 5553 and be like the dove 3123 [that] maketh her nest 7077-17 in the sides 5676 of the hole's 6354 mouth. 6310

48:29 We have heard 8085-1 the pride 1347 of Moab, 4124 (he is exceeding 3966 proud) 1343 his loftiness, 1363 and his arrogancy, 1347 and his pride, 1346 and the haughtiness 7312 of his heart. 3820

48:30 I know 3045-1 his wrath, 5678 saith 5002-7 the LORD; 3068 but [it shall] not [be] so; his lies 907 shall not so effect 6213-1 [it].

48:31 Therefore will I howl 3213-55 for Moab, 4124 and I will cry out 2199-4 for all Moab; 4124 [mine heart] shall mourn 1897-4 for the men 582 of Kirheres. 7025

48:32 O vine 1612 of Sibmah, 7643 I will weep 1058-4 for thee with the weeping 1065 of Jazer: 3270 thy plants 5189 are gone over 5674-1 the sea, 3220 they reach 5060-1 [even] to the sea 3220 of Jazer: 3270 the spoiler 7703-6 is fallen 5307-1 upon thy summer fruits 7019 and upon thy vintage. 1210

48:33 And joy 8057 and gladness 1524 is taken 622-8 from the plentiful field, 3759 and from the land 776 of Moab; 4124 and I have caused wine 3196 to fail 7673-52 from the winepresses: 3342 none shall tread 1869-4 with shouting; 1959 [their] shouting 1959 [shall be] no shouting. 1959

48:34 From the cry 2201 of Heshbon 2809 [even] unto Elealeh, 500 [and even] unto Jahaz, 3096 have they uttered 5414-1 their voice, 6963 from Zoar 6820 [even] unto Horonaim, 2773 [as] an heifer 5697 of three years old: 7992 for the waters 4325 also of Nimrim 5249 shall be desolate. 4923

48:35 Moreover I will cause to cease 7673-52 in Moab, 4124 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 him that offereth 5927-56 in the high places, 1116 and him that burneth incense 6999-56 to his gods. 430

48:36 Therefore mine heart 3820 shall sound 1993-4 for Moab 4124 like pipes, 2485 and mine heart 3820 shall sound 1993-4 like pipes 2485 for the men 582 of Kirheres: 7025 because the riches 3502 [that] he hath gotten 6213-1 are perished. 6-1

48:37 For every head 7218 [shall be] bald, 7144 and every beard 2206 clipped: 1639-7 upon all the hands 3027 [shall be] cuttings, 1417 and upon the loins 4975 sackcloth. 8242

48:38 [There shall be] lamentation 4553 generally upon all the housetops 1406 of Moab, 4124 and in the streets 7339 thereof: for I have broken 7665-1 Moab 4124 like a vessel 3627 wherein [is] no pleasure, 2656 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

48:39 They shall howl, 3213-54 [saying], How is it broken down! 2865-1 how hath Moab 4124 turned 6437-52 the back 6203 with shame! 954-1 so shall Moab 4124 be a derision 7814 and a dismaying 4288 to all them about 5439 him.

48:40 For thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 Behold, he shall fly 1675-4 as an eagle, 5404 and shall spread 6566-1 his wings 3671 over Moab. 4124

48:41 Kerioth 7152 is taken, 3920-8 and the strong holds 4679 are surprised, 8610-8 and the mighty men's 1368 hearts 3820 in Moab 4124 at that day 3117 shall be as the heart 3820 of a woman 802 in her pangs. 6887-56

48:42 And Moab 4124 shall be destroyed 8045-8 from [being] a people, 5971 because he hath magnified 1431-52 [himself] against the LORD. 3068

48:43 Fear, 6343 and the pit, 6354 and the snare, 6341 [shall be] upon thee, O inhabitant 3427-6 of Moab, 4124 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

48:44 He that fleeth 5127-5|5211-k from 6440 the fear 6343 shall fall 5307-4 into the pit; 6354 and he that getteth up 5927-6 out of the pit 6354 shall be taken 3920-11 in the snare: 6341 for I will bring 935-55 upon it, [even] upon Moab, 4124 the year 8141 of their visitation, 6486 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

48:45 They that fled 5127-5 stood 5975-1 under the shadow 6738 of Heshbon 2809 because of the force: 3581 but a fire 784 shall come forth 3318-1 out of Heshbon, 2809 and a flame 3852 from the midst 996 of Sihon, 5511 and shall devour 398-4 the corner 6285 of Moab, 4124 and the crown of the head 6936 of the tumultuous 7588 ones. 1121

48:46 Woe 188 be unto thee, O Moab! 4124 the people 5971 of Chemosh 3645 perisheth: 6-1 for thy sons 1121 are taken 3947-27 captives, 7628 and thy daughters 1323 captives. 7633

48:47 Yet will I bring again 7725-1 the captivity 7622 of Moab 4124 in the latter 319 days, 3117 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068 Thus far 2008 [is] the judgment 4941 of Moab. 4124

49:1 Concerning the Ammonites, 1121 5983 thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 Hath Israel 3478 no sons? 1121 hath he no heir? 3423-6 why [then] doth their king 4428 inherit 3423-1 Gad, 1410 and his people 5971 dwell 3427-1 in his cities? 5892

49:2 Therefore, behold, the days 3117 come, 935-6 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 that I will cause an alarm 8643 of war 4421 to be heard 8085-52 in Rabbah 7237 of the Ammonites; 1121 5983 and it shall be a desolate 8077 heap, 8510 and her daughters 1323 shall be burned 3341-4 with fire: 784 then shall Israel 3478 be heir 3423-1 unto them that were his heirs, 3423-6 saith 559-1 the LORD. 3068

49:3 Howl, 3213-54 O Heshbon, 2809 for Ai 5857 is spoiled: 7703-27 cry, 6817-3 ye daughters 1323 of Rabbah, 7237 gird 2296-3 you with sackcloth; 8242 lament, 5594-3 and run to and fro 7751-112 by the hedges; 1448 for their king 4428 shall go 3212-4 into captivity, 1473 [and] his priests 3548 and his princes 8269 together. 3162

49:4 Wherefore gloriest 1984-101 thou in the valleys, 6010 thy flowing 2100-6 valley, 6010 O backsliding 7728 daughter? 1323 that trusted 982-6 in her treasures, 214 [saying], Who shall come 935-4 unto me?

49:5 Behold, I will bring 935-56 a fear 6343 upon thee, saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD 3069 of hosts, 6635 from all those that be about 5439 thee; and ye shall be driven out 5080-8 every man 376 right forth; 6440 and none shall gather up 6908-18 him that wandereth. 5074-6

49:6 And afterward 310 I will bring again 7725-55 the captivity 7622 of the children 1121 of Ammon, 5983 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

49:7 Concerning Edom, 123 thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts; 6635 [Is] wisdom 2451 no more in Teman? 8487 is counsel 6098 perished 6-1 from the prudent? 995-5 is their wisdom 2451 vanished? 5628-8

49:8 Flee 5127-3 ye, turn back, 6437-90 dwell 3427-2 deep, 6009-52 O inhabitants 3427-6 of Dedan; 1719 for I will bring 935-52 the calamity 343 of Esau 6215 upon him, the time 6256 [that] I will visit 6485-1 him.

49:9 If grapegatherers 1219-6 come 935-1 to thee, would they not leave 7604-55 [some] gleaning grapes? 5955 if thieves 1590 by night, 3915 they will destroy 7843-52 till they have enough. 1767

49:10 But I have made Esau 6215 bare, 2834-1 I have uncovered 1540-14 his secret places, 4565 and he shall not be able 3201-4 to hide 2247-9 himself: his seed 2233 is spoiled, 7703-27 and his brethren, 251 and his neighbours, 7934 and he [is] not.

49:11 Leave 5800-3 thy fatherless children, 3490 I will preserve [them] alive; 2421-17 and let thy widows 490 trust 982-4 in me.

49:12 For thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 Behold, they whose judgment 4941 [was] not to drink 8354-2 of the cup 3563 have assuredly 8354-2 drunken; 8354-4 and [art] thou he [that] shall altogether 5352-2 go unpunished? 5352-11 thou shalt not go unpunished, 5352-11 but thou shalt surely 8354-2 drink 8354-4 [of it].

49:13 For I have sworn 7650-8 by myself, saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 that Bozrah 1224 shall become a desolation, 8047 a reproach, 2781 a waste, 2721 and a curse; 7045 and all the cities 5892 thereof shall be perpetual 5769 wastes. 2723

49:14 I have heard 8085-1 a rumour 8052 from the LORD, 3068 and an ambassador 6735 is sent 7971-7 unto the heathen, 1471 [saying], Gather ye together, 6908-100 and come 935-3 against her, and rise up 6965-3 to the battle. 4421

49:15 For, lo, I will make 5414-1 thee small 6996 among the heathen, 1471 [and] despised 959-7 among men. 120

49:16 Thy terribleness 8606 hath deceived 5377-52 thee, [and] the pride 2087 of thine heart, 3820 O thou that dwellest 7931-6 in the clefts 2288 of the rock, 5553 that holdest 8610-6 the height 4791 of the hill: 1389 though thou shouldest make thy nest 7064 as high 1361-55 as the eagle, 5404 I will bring thee down 3381-55 from thence, saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

49:17 Also Edom 123 shall be a desolation: 8047 every one that goeth 5674-6 by it shall be astonished, 8074-4 and shall hiss 8319-4 at all the plagues 4347 thereof.

49:18 As in the overthrow 4114 of Sodom 5467 and Gomorrah 6017 and the neighbour 7934 [cities] thereof, saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 no man 376 shall abide 3427-4 there, neither shall a son 1121 of man 120 dwell 1481-4 in it.

49:19 Behold, he shall come up 5927-4 like a lion 738 from the swelling 1347 of Jordan 3383 against the habitation 5116 of the strong: 386 but I will suddenly 7280-55 make him run away 7323-55 from her: and who [is] a chosen 977-7 [man, that] I may appoint 6485-4 over her? for who [is] like me? and who will appoint me the time? 3259-55 and who [is] that shepherd 7462-6 that will stand 5975-4 before 6440 me?

49:20 Therefore hear 8085-3 the counsel 6098 of the LORD, 3068 that he hath taken 3289-1 against Edom; 123 and his purposes, 4284 that he hath purposed 2803-1 against the inhabitants 3427-6 of Teman: 8487 Surely the least 6810 of the flock 6629 shall draw them out: 5498-4 surely he shall make their habitations 5116 desolate 8074-55 with them.

49:21 The earth 776 is moved 7493-1 at the noise 6963 of their fall, 5307-2 at the cry 6818 the noise 6963 thereof was heard 8085-8 in the Red 5488 sea. 3220

49:22 Behold, he shall come up 5927-4 and fly 1675-4 as the eagle, 5404 and spread 6566-4 his wings 3671 over Bozrah: 1224 and at that day 3117 shall the heart 3820 of the mighty men 1368 of Edom 123 be as the heart 3820 of a woman 802 in her pangs. 6887-56

49:23 Concerning Damascus. 1834 Hamath 2574 is confounded, 954-1 and Arpad: 774 for they have heard 8085-1 evil 7451 tidings: 8052 they are fainthearted; 4127-8 [there is] sorrow 1674 on the sea; 3220 it cannot 3808 3201-4 be quiet. 8252-53

49:24 Damascus 1834 is waxed feeble, 7503-1 [and] turneth 6437-52 herself to flee, 5127-2 and fear 7374 hath seized 2388-52 on [her]: anguish 6869 and sorrows 2256 have taken her, 270-1 as a woman in travail. 3205-6

49:25 How is the city 5892 of praise 8416 not left, 5800-27 the city 7151 of my joy! 4885

49:26 Therefore her young men 970 shall fall 5307-4 in her streets, 7339 and all the men 582 of war 4421 shall be cut off 1826-11 in that day, 3117 saith 5002-7 the LORD 3068 of hosts. 6635

49:27 And I will kindle 3341-52 a fire 784 in the wall 2346 of Damascus, 1834 and it shall consume 398-1 the palaces 759 of Benhadad. 1130

49:28 Concerning Kedar, 6938 and concerning the kingdoms 4467 of Hazor, 2674 which Nebuchadrezzar 5019 king 4428 of Babylon 894 shall smite, 5221-52 thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 Arise 6965-3 ye, go up 5927-3 to Kedar, 6938 and spoil 7703-3 the men 1121 of the east. 6924

49:29 Their tents 168 and their flocks 6629 shall they take away: 3947-4 they shall take 5375-4 to themselves their curtains, 3407 and all their vessels, 3627 and their camels; 1581 and they shall cry 7121-1 unto them, Fear 4032 [is] on every side. 5439

49:30 Flee, 5127-3 get 5110-3 you far 3966 off, dwell 3427-2 deep, 6009-52 O ye inhabitants 3427-6 of Hazor, 2674 saith 5002-7 the LORD; 3068 for Nebuchadrezzar 5019 king 4428 of Babylon 894 hath taken counsel 6098 3289-1 against you, and hath conceived 2803-1 a purpose 4284 against you.

49:31 Arise, 6965-3 get you up 5927-3 unto the wealthy 7961 nation, 1471 that dwelleth 3427-6 without care, 983 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 which have neither gates 1817 nor bars, 1280 [which] dwell 7931-4 alone. 910

49:32 And their camels 1581 shall be a booty, 957 and the multitude 1995 of their cattle 4735 a spoil: 7998 and I will scatter 2219-14 into all winds 7307 them [that are] in the utmost 7112-7 corners; 6285 and I will bring 935-55 their calamity 343 from all sides 5676 thereof, saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

49:33 And Hazor 2674 shall be a dwelling 4583 for dragons, 8577 [and] a desolation 8077 for 5704 ever: 5769 there shall no man 376 abide 3427-4 there, nor [any] son 1121 of man 120 dwell 1481-4 in it.

49:34 The word 1697 of the LORD 3068 that came to Jeremiah 3414 the prophet 5030 against Elam 5867 in the beginning 7225 of the reign 4438 of Zedekiah 6667 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 saying, 559-2

49:35 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts; 6635 Behold, I will break 7665-6 the bow 7198 of Elam, 5867 the chief 7225 of their might. 1369

49:36 And upon Elam 5867 will I bring 935-52 the four 702 winds 7307 from the four 702 quarters 7098 of heaven, 8064 and will scatter 2219-14 them toward all those winds; 7307 and there shall be no nation 1471 whither the outcasts 5080-12 of Elam 5867|5769-k shall not come. 935-4

49:37 For I will cause Elam 5867 to be dismayed 2865-52 before 6440 their enemies, 341-6 and before 6440 them that seek 1245-18 their life: 5315 and I will bring 935-52 evil 7451 upon them, [even] my fierce 2740 anger, 639 saith 5002-7 the LORD; 3068 and I will send 7971-14 the sword 2719 after 310 them, till I have consumed 3615-15 them:

49:38 And I will set 7760-1 my throne 3678 in Elam, 5867 and will destroy 6-52 from thence the king 4428 and the princes, 8269 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

49:39 But it shall come to pass in the latter 319 days, 3117 [that] I will bring again 7725-55|7725-4-k the captivity 7622|7622-k of Elam, 5867 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

50:1 The word 1697 that the LORD 3068 spake 1696-14 against Babylon 894 [and] against the land 776 of the Chaldeans 3778 by 3027 Jeremiah 3414 the prophet. 5030

50:2 Declare 5046-54 ye among the nations, 1471 and publish, 8085-54 and set up 5375-3 a standard; 5251 publish, 8085-54 [and] conceal 3582-17 not: say, 559-3 Babylon 894 is taken, 3920-8 Bel 1078 is confounded, 3001-52 Merodach 4781 is broken in pieces; 2865-1 her idols 6091 are confounded, 3001-52 her images 1544 are broken in pieces. 2865-1

50:3 For out of the north 6828 there cometh up 5927-1 a nation 1471 against her, which shall make 7896-4 her land 776 desolate, 8047 and none shall dwell 3427-6 therein: they shall remove, 5110-1 they shall depart, 1980-1 both man 120 and beast. 929

50:4 In those days, 3117 and in that time, 6256 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 the children 1121 of Israel 3478 shall come, 935-4 they and the children 1121 of Judah 3063 together, 3162 going 1980-2 and weeping: 1058-2 they shall go, 3212-4 and seek 1245-17 the LORD 3068 their God. 430

50:5 They shall ask 7592-4 the way 1870 to Zion 6726 with their faces 6440 thitherward, 2008 [saying], Come, 935-3 and let us join 3867-8 ourselves to the LORD 3068 in a perpetual 5769 covenant 1285 [that] shall not be forgotten. 7911-11

50:6 My people 5971 hath been lost 6-6 sheep: 6629 their shepherds 7462-6 have caused them to go astray, 8582-52 they have turned them away 7725-31|7726-k [on] the mountains: 2022 they have gone 1980-1 from mountain 2022 to hill, 1389 they have forgotten 7911-1 their restingplace. 7258

50:7 All that found 4672-6 them have devoured 398-1 them: and their adversaries 6862 said, 559-1 We offend 816-4 not, because they have sinned 2398-1 against the LORD, 3068 the habitation 5116 of justice, 6664 even the LORD, 3068 the hope 4723 of their fathers. 1

50:8 Remove 5110-3 out of the midst 8432 of Babylon, 894 and go forth 3318-3|3318-4-k out of the land 776 of the Chaldeans, 3778 and be as the he goats 6260 before 6440 the flocks. 6629

50:9 For, lo, I will raise 5782-56 and cause to come up 5927-56 against Babylon 894 an assembly 6951 of great 1419 nations 1471 from the north 6828 country: 776 and they shall set themselves in array 6186-1 against her; from thence she shall be taken: 3920-11 their arrows 2671 [shall be] as of a mighty 1368 expert 7919-56|7921-56-q man; none shall return 7725-4 in vain. 7387

50:10 And Chaldea 3778 shall be a spoil: 7998 all that spoil 7997-6 her shall be satisfied, 7646-4 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

50:11 Because ye were glad, 8055-4 because ye rejoiced, 5937-4 O ye destroyers 8154-6 of mine heritage, 5159 because ye are grown fat 6335-4 as the heifer 5697 at grass, 1877|1758-5 and bellow 6670-4 as bulls; 47

50:12 Your mother 517 shall be sore 3966 confounded; 954-1 she that bare 3205-6 you shall be ashamed: 2659-1 behold, the hindermost 319 of the nations 1471 [shall be] a wilderness, 4057 a dry 6723 land, and a desert. 6160

50:13 Because of the wrath 7110 of the LORD 3068 it shall not be inhabited, 3427-4 but it shall be wholly desolate: 8077 every one that goeth 5674-6 by Babylon 894 shall be astonished, 8074-4 and hiss 8319-4 at all her plagues. 4347

50:14 Put yourselves in array 6186-3 against Babylon 894 round about: 5439 all ye that bend 1869-6 the bow, 7198 shoot 3034-3 at her, spare 2550-4 no arrows: 2671 for she hath sinned 2398-1 against the LORD. 3068

50:15 Shout 7321-54 against her round about: 5439 she hath given 5414-1 her hand: 3027 her foundations 803 are fallen, 5307-1 her walls 2346 are thrown down: 2040-8 for it [is] the vengeance 5360 of the LORD: 3068 take vengeance 5358-10 upon her; as she hath done, 6213-1 do 6213-3 unto her.

50:16 Cut off 3772-3 the sower 2232-6 from Babylon, 894 and him that handleth 8610-6 the sickle 4038 in the time 6256 of harvest: 7105 for fear 6440 of the oppressing 3238-6 sword 2719 they shall turn 6437-4 every one 376 to his people, 5971 and they shall flee 5127-4 every one 376 to his own land. 776

50:17 Israel 3478 [is] a scattered 6340-5 sheep; 7716 the lions 738 have driven [him] away: 5080-52 first 7223 the king 4428 of Assyria 804 hath devoured 398-1 him; and last 314 this Nebuchadrezzar 5019 king 4428 of Babylon 894 hath broken his bones. 6105-14

50:18 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 the God 430 of Israel; 3478 Behold, I will punish 6485-6 the king 4428 of Babylon 894 and his land, 776 as I have punished 6485-1 the king 4428 of Assyria. 804

50:19 And I will bring Israel 3478 again 7725-31 to his habitation, 5116 and he shall feed 7462-1 on Carmel 3760 and Bashan, 1316 and his soul 5315 shall be satisfied 7646-4 upon mount 2022 Ephraim 669 and Gilead. 1568

50:20 In those days, 3117 and in that time, 6256 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 the iniquity 5771 of Israel 3478 shall be sought for, 1245-29 and [there shall be] none; and the sins 2403 of Judah, 3063 and they shall not be found: 4672-11 for I will pardon 5545-4 them whom I reserve. 7604-55

50:21 Go up 5927-3 against the land 776 of Merathaim, 4850 [even] against it, and against the inhabitants 3427-6 of Pekod: 6489 waste 2717-3 and utterly destroy 2763-53 after 310 them, saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 and do 6213-3 according to all that I have commanded 6680-14 thee.

50:22 A sound 6963 of battle 4421 [is] in the land, 776 and of great 1419 destruction. 7667

50:23 How is the hammer 6360 of the whole earth 776 cut asunder 1438-8 and broken! 7665-11 how is Babylon 894 become a desolation 8047 among the nations! 1471

50:24 I have laid a snare 3369-1 for thee, and thou art also taken, 3920-8 O Babylon, 894 and thou wast not aware: 3045-1 thou art found, 4672-8 and also caught, 8610-8 because thou hast striven 1624-98 against the LORD. 3068

50:25 The LORD 3068 hath opened 6605-1 his armoury, 214 and hath brought forth 3318-55 the weapons 3627 of his indignation: 2195 for this [is] the work 4399 of the Lord 136 GOD 3069 of hosts 6635 in the land 776 of the Chaldeans. 3778

50:26 Come 935-3 against her from the utmost border, 7093 open 6605-3 her storehouses: 3965 cast her up 5549-3 as heaps, 6194 and destroy her utterly: 2763-54 let nothing of her be left. 7611

50:27 Slay 2717-3 all her bullocks; 6499 let them go down 3381-4 to the slaughter: 2874 woe 1945 unto them! for their day 3117 is come, 935-6 the time 6256 of their visitation. 6486

50:28 The voice 6963 of them that flee 5127-5 and escape out 6405 of the land 776 of Babylon, 894 to declare 5046-53 in Zion 6726 the vengeance 5360 of the LORD 3068 our God, 430 the vengeance 5360 of his temple. 1964

50:29 Call together 8085-54 the archers 7228 against Babylon: 894 all ye that bend 1869-6 the bow, 7198 camp 2583-3 against it round about; 5439 let none thereof escape: 6413 recompense 7999-16 her according to her work; 6467 according to all that she hath done, 6213-1 do 6213-3 unto her: for she hath been proud 2102-1 against the LORD, 3068 against the Holy One 6918 of Israel. 3478

50:30 Therefore shall her young men 970 fall 5307-4 in the streets, 7339 and all her men 582 of war 4421 shall be cut off 1826-11 in that day, 3117 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

50:31 Behold, I [am] against thee, [O thou] most proud, 2087 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD 3069 of hosts: 6635 for thy day 3117 is come, 935-6 the time 6256 [that] I will visit 6485-1 thee.

50:32 And the most proud 2087 shall stumble 3782-1 and fall, 5307-1 and none shall raise him up: 6965-56 and I will kindle 3341-52 a fire 784 in his cities, 5892 and it shall devour 398-1 all round about 5439 him.

50:33 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts; 6635 The children 1121 of Israel 3478 and the children 1121 of Judah 3063 [were] oppressed 6231-7 together: 3162 and all that took them captives 7617-6 held 2388-52 them fast; they refused 3985-14 to let them go. 7971-15

50:34 Their Redeemer 1350-6 [is] strong; 2389 the LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 [is] his name: 8034 he shall throughly 7378-2 plead 7378-4 their cause, 7379 that he may give rest 7280-52 to the land, 776 and disquiet 7264-52 the inhabitants 3427-6 of Babylon. 894

50:35 A sword 2719 [is] upon the Chaldeans, 3778 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 and upon the inhabitants 3427-6 of Babylon, 894 and upon her princes, 8269 and upon her wise 2450 [men].

50:36 A sword 2719 [is] upon the liars; 907 and they shall dote: 2973-8 a sword 2719 [is] upon her mighty men; 1368 and they shall be dismayed. 2865-1

50:37 A sword 2719 [is] upon their horses, 5483 and upon their chariots, 7393 and upon all the mingled people 6153 that [are] in the midst 8432 of her; and they shall become as women: 802 a sword 2719 [is] upon her treasures; 214 and they shall be robbed. 962-27

50:38 A drought 2721 [is] upon her waters; 4325 and they shall be dried up: 3001-1 for it [is] the land 776 of graven images, 6456 and they are mad 1984-108 upon [their] idols. 367

50:39 Therefore the wild beasts of the desert 6728 with the wild beasts of the islands 338|339 shall dwell 3427-4 [there], and the owls 1323 3284 shall dwell 3427-1 therein: and it shall be no more inhabited 3427-4 for ever; 5331 neither shall it be dwelt 7931-4 in from generation 1755 to generation. 1755

50:40 As God 430 overthrew 4114 Sodom 5467 and Gomorrah 6017 and the neighbour 7934 [cities] thereof, saith 5002-7 the LORD; 3068 [so] shall no man 376 abide 3427-4 there, neither shall any son 1121 of man 120 dwell 1481-4 therein.

50:41 Behold, a people 5971 shall come 935-6 from the north, 6828 and a great 1419 nation, 1471 and many 7227 kings 4428 shall be raised up 5782-11 from the coasts 3411 of the earth. 776

50:42 They shall hold 2388-55 the bow 7198 and the lance: 3591 they [are] cruel, 394 and will not shew mercy: 7355-17 their voice 6963 shall roar 1993-4 like the sea, 3220 and they shall ride 7392-4 upon horses, 5483 [every one] put in array, 6186-7 like a man 376 to the battle, 4421 against thee, O daughter 1323 of Babylon. 894

50:43 The king 4428 of Babylon 894 hath heard 8085-1 the report 8088 of them, and his hands 3027 waxed feeble: 7503-1 anguish 6869 took hold 2388-52 of him, [and] pangs 2427 as of a woman in travail. 3205-6

50:44 Behold, he shall come up 5927-4 like a lion 738 from the swelling 1347 of Jordan 3383 unto the habitation 5116 of the strong: 386 but I will make them suddenly 7280-55 run away 7323-55|7323-4-k from her: and who [is] a chosen 977-7 [man, that] I may appoint 6485-4 over her? for who [is] like me? and who will appoint me the time? 3259-55 and who [is] that shepherd 7462-6 that will stand 5975-4 before 6440 me?

50:45 Therefore hear 8085-3 ye the counsel 6098 of the LORD, 3068 that he hath taken 3289-1 against Babylon; 894 and his purposes, 4284 that he hath purposed 2803-1 against the land 776 of the Chaldeans: 3778 Surely the least 6810 of the flock 6629 shall draw them out: 5498-4 surely he shall make [their] habitation 5116 desolate 8074-55 with them.

50:46 At the noise 6963 of the taking 8610-8 of Babylon 894 the earth 776 is moved, 7493-11 and the cry 2201 is heard 8085-8 among the nations. 1471

51:1 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 Behold, I will raise up 5782-56 against Babylon, 894 and against them that dwell 3427-6 in the midst 3820 of them that rise up 6965-5 against me, a destroying 7843-56 wind; 7307

51:2 And will send 7971-14 unto Babylon 894 fanners, 2114-5 that shall fan 2219-14 her, and shall empty 1238-34 her land: 776 for in the day 3117 of trouble 7451 they shall be against her round about. 5439

51:3 Against [him that] bendeth 1869-4 let the archer 1869-6 bend 1869-4 his bow, 7198 and against [him that] lifteth himself up 5927-101 in his brigandine: 5630 and spare 2550-4 ye not her young men; 970 destroy ye utterly 2763-54 all her host. 6635

51:4 Thus the slain 2491 shall fall 5307-1 in the land 776 of the Chaldeans, 3778 and [they that are] thrust through 1856-30 in her streets. 2351

51:5 For Israel 3478 [hath] not [been] forsaken, 488 nor Judah 3063 of his God, 430 of the LORD 3068 of hosts; 6635 though their land 776 was filled 4390-1 with sin 817 against the Holy One 6918 of Israel. 3478

51:6 Flee 5127-3 out of the midst 8432 of Babylon, 894 and deliver 4422-16 every man 376 his soul: 5315 be not cut off 1826-11 in her iniquity; 5771 for this [is] the time 6256 of the LORD'S 3068 vengeance; 5360 he will render 7999-18 unto her a recompence. 1576

51:7 Babylon 894 [hath been] a golden 2091 cup 3563 in the LORD'S 3068 hand, 3027 that made all the earth 776 drunken: 7937-18 the nations 1471 have drunken 8354-1 of her wine; 3196 therefore the nations 1471 are mad. 1984-108

51:8 Babylon 894 is suddenly 6597 fallen 5307-1 and destroyed: 7665-11 howl 3213-54 for her; take 3947-3 balm 6875 for her pain, 4341 if so be she may be healed. 7495-11

51:9 We would have healed 7495-14 Babylon, 894 but she is not healed: 7495-8 forsake 5800-3 her, and let us go 3212-4 every one 376 into his own country: 776 for her judgment 4941 reacheth 5060-1 unto heaven, 8064 and is lifted up 5375-8 [even] to the skies. 7834

51:10 The LORD 3068 hath brought forth 3318-52 our righteousness: 6666 come, 935-3 and let us declare 5608-17 in Zion 6726 the work 4639 of the LORD 3068 our God. 430

51:11 Make bright 1305-54 the arrows; 2671 gather 4390-3 the shields: 7982 the LORD 3068 hath raised up 5782-52 the spirit 7307 of the kings 4428 of the Medes: 4074 for his device 4209 [is] against Babylon, 894 to destroy 7843-53 it; because it [is] the vengeance 5360 of the LORD, 3068 the vengeance 5360 of his temple. 1964

51:12 Set up 5375-3 the standard 5251 upon the walls 2346 of Babylon, 894 make the watch 4929 strong, 2388-54 set up 6965-54 the watchmen, 8104-6 prepare 3559-54 the ambushes: 693-6 for the LORD 3068 hath both devised 2161-1 and done 6213-1 that which he spake 1696-14 against the inhabitants 3427-6 of Babylon. 894

51:13 O thou that dwellest 7931-6|7931-1-k upon many 7227 waters, 4325 abundant 7227 in treasures, 214 thine end 7093 is come, 935-6 [and] the measure 520 of thy covetousness. 1215

51:14 The LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 hath sworn 7650-8 by himself, 5315 [saying], Surely I will fill 4390-14 thee with men, 120 as with caterpillers; 3218 and they shall lift up 6030-1 a shout 1959 against thee.

51:15 He hath made 6213-6 the earth 776 by his power, 3581 he hath established 3559-56 the world 8398 by his wisdom, 2451 and hath stretched out 5186-1 the heaven 8064 by his understanding. 8394

51:16 When he uttereth 5414-2 [his] voice, 6963 [there is] a multitude 1995 of waters 4325 in the heavens; 8064 and he causeth the vapours 5387 to ascend 5927-55 from the ends 7097 of the earth: 776 he maketh 6213-1 lightnings 1300 with rain, 4306 and bringeth forth 3318-55 the wind 7307 out of his treasures. 214

51:17 Every man 120 is brutish 1197-8 by [his] knowledge; 1847 every founder 6884-6 is confounded 3001-52 by the graven image: 6459 for his molten image 5262 [is] falsehood, 8267 and [there is] no breath 7307 in them.

51:18 They [are] vanity, 1892 the work 4639 of errors: 8595 in the time 6256 of their visitation 6486 they shall perish. 6-4

51:19 The portion 2506 of Jacob 3290 [is] not like them; for he [is] the former 3335-6 of all things: and [Israel is] the rod 7626 of his inheritance: 5159 the LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 [is] his name. 8034

51:20 Thou [art] my battle axe 4661 [and] weapons 3627 of war: 4421 for with thee will I break in pieces 5310-14 the nations, 1471 and with thee will I destroy 7843-52 kingdoms; 4467

51:21 And with thee will I break in pieces 5310-14 the horse 5483 and his rider; 7392-6 and with thee will I break in pieces 5310-14 the chariot 7393 and his rider; 7392-6

51:22 With thee also will I break in pieces 5310-14 man 376 and woman; 802 and with thee will I break in pieces 5310-14 old 2205 and young; 5288 and with thee will I break in pieces 5310-14 the young man 970 and the maid; 1330

51:23 I will also break in pieces 5310-14 with thee the shepherd 7462-6 and his flock; 5739 and with thee will I break in pieces 5310-14 the husbandman 406 and his yoke 6776 of oxen; and with thee will I break in pieces 5310-14 captains 6346 and rulers. 5461

51:24 And I will render 7999-14 unto Babylon 894 and to all the inhabitants 3427-6 of Chaldea 3778 all their evil 7451 that they have done 6213-1 in Zion 6726 in your sight, 5869 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

51:25 Behold, I [am] against thee, O destroying 4889 mountain, 2022 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 which destroyest 7843-56 all the earth: 776 and I will stretch out 5186-1 mine hand 3027 upon thee, and roll thee down 1556-43 from the rocks, 5553 and will make 5414-1 thee a burnt 8316 mountain. 2022

51:26 And they shall not take 3947-4 of thee a stone 68 for a corner, 6438 nor a stone 68 for foundations; 4146 but thou shalt be desolate 8077 for ever, 5769 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

51:27 Set ye up 5375-3 a standard 5251 in the land, 776 blow 8628-3 the trumpet 7782 among the nations, 1471 prepare 6942-16 the nations 1471 against her, call together 8085-54 against her the kingdoms 4467 of Ararat, 780 Minni, 4508 and Ashchenaz; 813 appoint 6485-3 a captain 2951 against her; cause the horses 5483 to come up 5927-54 as the rough 5569 caterpillers. 3218

51:28 Prepare 6942-16 against her the nations 1471 with the kings 4428 of the Medes, 4074 the captains 6346 thereof, and all the rulers 5461 thereof, and all the land 776 of his dominion. 4475

51:29 And the land 776 shall tremble 7493-4 and sorrow: 2342-4 for every purpose 4284 of the LORD 3068 shall be performed 6965-1 against Babylon, 894 to make 7760-2 the land 776 of Babylon 894 a desolation 8047 without an inhabitant. 3427-6

51:30 The mighty men 1368 of Babylon 894 have forborn 2308-1 to fight, 3898-9 they have remained 3427-1 in [their] holds: 4679 their might 1369 hath failed; 5405-1 they became as women: 802 they have burned 3341-52 her dwellingplaces; 4908 her bars 1280 are broken. 7665-8

51:31 One post 7323-5 shall run 7323-4 to meet 7125-2 another, 7323-5 and one messenger 5046-56 to meet 7125-2 another, 5046-56 to shew 5046-53 the king 4428 of Babylon 894 that his city 5892 is taken 3920-8 at [one] end, 7097

51:32 And that the passages 4569 are stopped, 8610-8 and the reeds 98 they have burned 8313-1 with fire, 784 and the men 582 of war 4421 are affrighted. 926-8

51:33 For thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 the God 430 of Israel; 3478 The daughter 1323 of Babylon 894 [is] like a threshingfloor, 1637 [it is] time 6256 to thresh 1869-53 her: yet a little 4592 while, and the time 6256 of her harvest 7105 shall come. 935-1

51:34 Nebuchadrezzar 5019 the king 4428 of Babylon 894 hath devoured 398-1 me, he hath crushed 2000-1 me, he hath made 3322-52 me an empty 7385 vessel, 3627 he hath swallowed me up 1104-1 like a dragon, 8577 he hath filled 4390-14 his belly 3770 with my delicates, 5730 he hath cast me out. 1740-52

51:35 The violence 2555 done to me and to my flesh 7607 [be] upon Babylon, 894 shall the inhabitant 3427-6 of Zion 6726 say; 559-4 and my blood 1818 upon the inhabitants 3427-6 of Chaldea, 3778 shall Jerusalem 3389 say. 559-4

51:36 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 Behold, I will plead 7378-5 thy cause, 7379 and take vengeance 5358-14 for thee; 5360 and I will dry up 2717-52 her sea, 3220 and make her springs 4726 dry. 3001-52

51:37 And Babylon 894 shall become heaps, 1530 a dwellingplace 4583 for dragons, 8577 an astonishment, 8047 and an hissing, 8322 without an inhabitant. 3427-6

51:38 They shall roar 7580-4 together 3162 like lions: 3715 they shall yell 5286-1 as lions' 738 whelps. 1484

51:39 In their heat 2527 I will make 7896-4 their feasts, 4960 and I will make them drunken, 7937-52 that they may rejoice, 5937-4 and sleep 3462-1 a perpetual 5769 sleep, 8142 and not wake, 6974-55 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

51:40 I will bring them down 3381-55 like lambs 3733 to the slaughter, 2873-2 like rams 352 with he goats. 6260

51:41 How is Sheshach 8347 taken! 3920-8 and how is the praise 8416 of the whole earth 776 surprised! 8610-11 how is Babylon 894 become an astonishment 8047 among the nations! 1471

51:42 The sea 3220 is come up 5927-1 upon Babylon: 894 she is covered 3680-8 with the multitude 1995 of the waves 1530 thereof.

51:43 Her cities 5892 are a desolation, 8047 a dry 6723 land, 776 and a wilderness, 6160 a land 776 wherein 2004 no man 376 dwelleth, 3427-4 neither doth [any] son 1121 of man 120 pass 5674-4 thereby. 2004

51:44 And I will punish 6485-1 Bel 1078 in Babylon, 894 and I will bring forth 3318-52 out of his mouth 6310 that which he hath swallowed up: 1105 and the nations 1471 shall not flow together 5102-4 any more unto him: yea, the wall 2346 of Babylon 894 shall fall. 5307-1

51:45 My people, 5971 go ye out 3318-3 of the midst 8432 of her, and deliver 4422-16 ye every man 376 his soul 5315 from the fierce 2740 anger 639 of the LORD. 3068

51:46 And lest your heart 3824 faint, 7401-11 and ye fear 3372-4 for the rumour 8052 that shall be heard 8085-12 in the land; 776 a rumour 8052 shall both come 935-1 [one] year, 8141 and after 310 that in [another] year 8141 [shall come] a rumour, 8052 and violence 2555 in the land, 776 ruler 4910-6 against ruler. 4910-6

51:47 Therefore, behold, the days 3117 come, 935-6 that I will do judgment 6485-1 upon the graven images 6456 of Babylon: 894 and her whole land 776 shall be confounded, 954-4 and all her slain 2491 shall fall 5307-4 in the midst 8432 of her.

51:48 Then the heaven 8064 and the earth, 776 and all that [is] therein, shall sing 7442-14 for Babylon: 894 for the spoilers 7703-6 shall come 935-4 unto her from the north, 6828 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

51:49 As 1571 Babylon 894 [hath caused] the slain 2491 of Israel 3478 to fall, 5307-2 so 1571 at Babylon 894 shall fall 5307-1 the slain 2491 of all the earth. 776

51:50 Ye that have escaped 6405 the sword, 2719 go away, 1980-3 stand not still: 5975-4 remember 2142-3 the LORD 3068 afar off, 7350 and let Jerusalem 3389 come 5927-4 into your mind. 3824

51:51 We are confounded, 954-1 because we have heard 8085-1 reproach: 2781 shame 3639 hath covered 3680-14 our faces: 6440 for strangers 2114-5 are come 935-1 into the sanctuaries 4720 of the LORD'S 3068 house. 1004

51:52 Wherefore, behold, the days 3117 come, 935-6 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 that I will do judgment 6485-1 upon her graven images: 6456 and through all her land 776 the wounded 2491 shall groan. 602-4

51:53 Though Babylon 894 should mount up 5927-4 to heaven, 8064 and though she should fortify 1219-17 the height 4791 of her strength, 5797 [yet] 227 from me shall spoilers 7703-6 come 935-4 unto her, saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

51:54 A sound 6963 of a cry 2201 [cometh] from Babylon, 894 and great 1419 destruction 7667 from the land 776 of the Chaldeans: 3778

51:55 Because the LORD 3068 hath spoiled 7703-6 Babylon, 894 and destroyed 6-14 out of her the great 1419 voice; 6963 when her waves 1530 do roar 1993-1 like great 7227 waters, 4325 a noise 7588 of their voice 6963 is uttered: 5414-8

51:56 Because the spoiler 7703-6 is come 935-1 upon her, [even] upon Babylon, 894 and her mighty men 1368 are taken, 3920-8 every one of their bows 7198 is broken: 2865-14 for the LORD 3068 God 410 of recompences 1578 shall surely 7999-15 requite. 7999-17

51:57 And I will make drunk 7937-52 her princes, 8269 and her wise 2450 [men], her captains, 6346 and her rulers, 5461 and her mighty men: 1368 and they shall sleep 3462-1 a perpetual 5769 sleep, 8142 and not wake, 6974-55 saith 5002-7 the King, 4428 whose name 8034 [is] the LORD 3068 of hosts. 6635

51:58 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts; 6635 The broad 7342 walls 2346 of Babylon 894 shall be utterly 6209-44 broken, 6209-118 and her high 1364 gates 8179 shall be burned 3341-4 with fire; 784 and the people 5971 shall labour 3021-4 in 1767 vain, 7385 and the folk 3816 in 1767 the fire, 784 and they shall be weary. 3286-1

51:59 The word 1697 which Jeremiah 3414 the prophet 5030 commanded 6680-14 Seraiah 8304 the son 1121 of Neriah, 5374 the son 1121 of Maaseiah, 4271 when he went 3212-2 with Zedekiah 6667 the king 4428 of Judah 3063 into Babylon 894 in the fourth 7243 year 8141 of his reign. 4427-2 And [this] Seraiah 8304 [was] a quiet 4496 prince. 8269

51:60 So Jeremiah 3414 wrote 3789-4 in a 259 book 5612 all the evil 7451 that should come 935-4 upon Babylon, 894 [even] all these words 1697 that are written 3789-7 against Babylon. 894

51:61 And Jeremiah 3414 said 559-4 to Seraiah, 8304 When thou comest 935-2 to Babylon, 894 and shalt see, 7200-1 and shalt read 7121-1 all these words; 1697

51:62 Then shalt thou say, 559-1 O LORD, 3068 thou hast spoken 1696-14 against this place, 4725 to cut it off, 3772-53 that none shall remain 3427-6 in it, neither man 120 nor beast, 929 but that it shall be desolate 8077 for ever. 5769

51:63 And it shall be, when thou hast made an end 3615-15 of reading 7121-2 this book, 5612 [that] thou shalt bind 7194-4 a stone 68 to it, and cast 7993-52 it into the midst 8432 of Euphrates: 6578

51:64 And thou shalt say, 559-1 Thus shall Babylon 894 sink, 8257-4 and shall not rise 6965-4 from 6440 the evil 7451 that I will bring 935-56 upon her: and they shall be weary. 3286-1 Thus far [are] the words 1697 of Jeremiah. 3414

52:1 Zedekiah 6667 [was] one 259 and twenty 6242 years 8141 old 1121 when he began to reign, 4427-2 and he reigned 4427-1 eleven 259 6240 years 8141 in Jerusalem. 3389 And his mother's 517 name 8034 [was] Hamutal 2537 the daughter 1323 of Jeremiah 3414 of Libnah. 3841

52:2 And he did 6213-4 [that which was] evil 7451 in the eyes 5869 of the LORD, 3068 according to all that Jehoiakim 3079 had done. 6213-1

52:3 For through 5921 the anger 639 of the LORD 3068 it came to pass in Jerusalem 3389 and Judah, 3063 till he had cast them out 7993-53 from his presence, 6440 that Zedekiah 6667 rebelled 4775-4 against the king 4428 of Babylon. 894

52:4 And it came to pass in the ninth 8671 year 8141 of his reign, 4427-2 in the tenth 6224 month, 2320 in the tenth 6218 [day] of the month, 2320 [that] Nebuchadrezzar 5019 king 4428 of Babylon 894 came, 935-1 he and all his army, 2428 against Jerusalem, 3389 and pitched 2583-4 against it, and built 1129-4 forts 1785 against it round about. 5439

52:5 So the city 5892 was besieged 935-4 4692 unto the eleventh 6249 6240 year 8141 of king 4428 Zedekiah. 6667

52:6 And in the fourth 7243 month, 2320 in the ninth 8672 [day] of the month, 2320 the famine 7458 was sore 2388-4 in the city, 5892 so that there was no bread 3899 for the people 5971 of the land. 776

52:7 Then the city 5892 was broken up, 1234-11 and all the men 582 of war 4421 fled, 1272-4 and went forth 3318-4 out of the city 5892 by night 3915 by the way 1870 of the gate 8179 between the two walls, 2346 which [was] by the king's 4428 garden; 1588 (now the Chaldeans 3778 [were] by the city 5892 round about:) 5439 and they went 3212-4 by the way 1870 of the plain. 6160

52:8 But the army 2428 of the Chaldeans 3778 pursued 7291-4 after 310 the king, 4428 and overtook 5381-55 Zedekiah 6667 in the plains 6160 of Jericho; 3405 and all his army 2428 was scattered 6327-8 from him.

52:9 Then they took 8610-4 the king, 4428 and carried him up 5927-55 unto the king 4428 of Babylon 894 to Riblah 7247 in the land 776 of Hamath; 2574 where he gave 1696-17 judgment 4941 upon him.

52:10 And the king 4428 of Babylon 894 slew 7819-4 the sons 1121 of Zedekiah 6667 before his eyes: 5869 he slew 7819-1 also all the princes 8269 of Judah 3063 in Riblah. 7247

52:11 Then he put out 5786-14 the eyes 5869 of Zedekiah; 6667 and the king 4428 of Babylon 894 bound 631-4 him in chains, 5178 and carried 935-55 him to Babylon, 894 and put 5414-4 him in prison 1004 6486 till the day 3117 of his death. 4194

52:12 Now in the fifth 2549 month, 2320 in the tenth 6218 [day] of the month, 2320 which [was] the 8141 nineteenth 8672 6240 year 8141 of 4428 Nebuchadrezzar 5019 king 4428 of Babylon, 894 came 935-1 Nebuzaradan, 5018 captain 7227 of the guard, 2876 [which] served 5975-1 6440 the king 4428 of Babylon, 894 into Jerusalem, 3389

52:13 And burned 8313-4 the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and the king's 4428 house; 1004 and all the houses 1004 of Jerusalem, 3389 and all the houses 1004 of the great 1419 [men], burned 8313-1 he with fire: 784

52:14 And all the army 2428 of the Chaldeans, 3778 that [were] with the captain 7227 of the guard, 2876 brake down 5422-1 all the walls 2346 of Jerusalem 3389 round about. 5439

52:15 Then Nebuzaradan 5018 the captain 7227 of the guard 2876 carried away captive 1540-52 [certain] of the poor 1803 of the people, 5971 and the residue 3499 of the people 5971 that remained 7604-12 in the city, 5892 and those that fell away, 5307-6 that fell 5307-1 to the king 4428 of Babylon, 894 and the rest 3499 of the multitude. 527

52:16 But Nebuzaradan 5018 the captain 7227 of the guard 2876 left 7604-52 [certain] of the poor 1803 of the land 776 for vinedressers 3755 and for husbandmen. 3009-6

52:17 Also the pillars 5982 of brass 5178 that [were] in the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and the bases, 4350 and the brasen 5178 sea 3220 that [was] in the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 the Chaldeans 3778 brake, 7665-14 and carried 5375-4 all the brass 5178 of them to Babylon. 894

52:18 The caldrons 5518 also, and the shovels, 3257 and the snuffers, 4212 and the bowls, 4219 and the spoons, 3709 and all the vessels 3627 of brass 5178 wherewith they ministered, 8334-17 took they away. 3947-1

52:19 And the basons, 5592 and the firepans, 4289 and the bowls, 4219 and the caldrons, 5518 and the candlesticks, 4501 and the spoons, 3709 and the cups; 4518 [that] which [was] of gold 2091 [in] gold, 2091 and [that] which [was] of silver 3701 [in] silver, 3701 took 3947-1 the captain 7227 of the guard 2876 away.

52:20 The two 8147 pillars, 5982 one 259 sea, 3220 and twelve 8147 6240 brasen 5178 bulls 1241 that [were] under the bases, 4350 which king 4428 Solomon 8010 had made 6213-1 in the house 1004 of the LORD: 3068 the brass 5178 of all these vessels 3627 was without weight. 4948

52:21 And [concerning] the pillars, 5982 the height 6967 of one 259 pillar 5982 [was] eighteen 8083 6240 cubits; 520 and a fillet 2339 of twelve 8147 6240 cubits 520 did compass 5437-4 it; and the thickness 5672 thereof [was] four 702 fingers: 676 [it was] hollow. 5014-7

52:22 And a chapiter 3805 of brass 5178 [was] upon it; and the height 6967 of one 259 chapiter 3805 [was] five 2568 cubits, 520 with network 7639 and pomegranates 7416 upon the chapiters 3805 round about, 5439 all [of] brass. 5178 The second 8145 pillar 5982 also and the pomegranates 7416 [were] like unto these.

52:23 And there were ninety 8673 and six 8337 pomegranates 7416 on a side; 7307 [and] all the pomegranates 7416 upon the network 7639 [were] an hundred 3967 round about. 5439

52:24 And the captain 7227 of the guard 2876 took 3947-4 Seraiah 8304 the chief 7218 priest, 3548 and Zephaniah 6846 the second 4932 priest, 3548 and the three 7969 keepers 8104-6 of the door: 5592

52:25 He took 3947-1 also out of the city 5892 an 259 eunuch, 5631 which had the charge 6496 of the men 582 of war; 4421 and seven 7651 men 582 of them that were near 7200-6 the king's 4428 person, 6440 which were found 4672-8 in the city; 5892 and the principal 8269 scribe 5608-6 of the host, 6635 who mustered 6633-56 the people 5971 of the land; 776 and threescore 8346 men 376 of the people 5971 of the land, 776 that were found 4672-12 in the midst 8432 of the city. 5892

52:26 So Nebuzaradan 5018 the captain 7227 of the guard 2876 took 3947-4 them, and brought 3212-55 them to the king 4428 of Babylon 894 to Riblah. 7247

52:27 And the king 4428 of Babylon 894 smote 5221-55 them, and put them to death 4191-55 in Riblah 7247 in the land 776 of Hamath. 2574 Thus Judah 3063 was carried away captive 1540-4 out of his own land. 127

52:28 This [is] the people 5971 whom Nebuchadrezzar 5019 carried away captive: 1540-52 in the seventh 7651 year 8141 three 7969 thousand 505 Jews 3064 and three 7969 and twenty: 6242

52:29 In the eighteenth 8083 6240 year 8141 of Nebuchadrezzar 5019 he carried away captive 1540-52 from Jerusalem 3389 eight 8083 hundred 3967 thirty 7970 and two 8147 persons: 5315

52:30 In the three 7969 and twentieth 6242 year 8141 of Nebuchadrezzar 5019 Nebuzaradan 5018 the captain 7227 of the guard 2876 carried away captive 1540-52 of the Jews 3064 seven 7651 hundred 3967 forty 705 and five 2568 persons: 5315 all the persons 5315 [were] four 702 thousand 505 and six 8337 hundred. 3967

52:31 And it came to pass in the seven 7651 and thirtieth 7970 year 8141 of the captivity 1546 of Jehoiachin 3078 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 in the twelfth 8147 6240 month, 2320 in the five 2568 and twentieth 6242 [day] of the month, 2320 [that] Evilmerodach 192 king 4428 of Babylon 894 in the [first] year 8141 of his reign 4438 lifted up 5375-1 the head 7218 of Jehoiachin 3078 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 and brought him forth 3318-55 out of prison, 1004 3628

52:32 And spake 1696-17 kindly 2896 unto him, and set 5414-4 his throne 3678 above 4605 the throne 3678 of the kings 4428 that [were] with him in Babylon, 894

52:33 And changed 8138-14 his prison 3608 garments: 899 and he did continually 8548 eat 398-1 bread 3899 before 6440 him all the days 3117 of his life. 2416

52:34 And [for] his diet, 737 there was a continual 8548 diet 737 given 5414-8 him of the king 4428 of Babylon, 894 every day 3117 3117 a portion 1697 until the day 3117 of his death, 4194 all the days 3117 of his life. 2416
