1:1 Now these [are] the names 8034 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 which came 935-6 into Egypt; 4714 every man 376 and his household 1004 came 935-1 with Jacob. 3290
1:2 Reuben, 7205 Simeon, 8095 Levi, 3878 and Judah, 3063
1:3 Issachar, 3485 Zebulun, 2074 and Benjamin, 1144
1:4 Dan, 1835 and Naphtali, 5321 Gad, 1410 and Asher. 836
1:5 And all the souls 5315 that came out 3318-6 of the loins 3409 of Jacob 3290 were seventy 7657 souls: 5315 for Joseph 3130 was in Egypt 4714 [already].
1:6 And Joseph 3130 died, 4191-4 and all his brethren, 251 and all that generation. 1755
1:7 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 were fruitful, 6509-1 and increased abundantly, 8317-4 and multiplied, 7235-4 and waxed exceeding 3966 3966 mighty; 6105-4 and the land 776 was filled 4390-11 with them.
1:8 Now there arose up 6965-4 a new 2319 king 4428 over Egypt, 4714 which knew 3045-1 not Joseph. 3130
1:9 And he said 559-4 unto his people, 5971 Behold, the people 5971 of the children 1121 of Israel 3478 [are] more 7227 and mightier 6099 than we:
1:10 Come on, 3051-3 let us deal wisely 2449-101 with them; lest they multiply, 7235-4 and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out 7122-4 any war, 4421 they 1931 join 3254-8 also unto our enemies, 8130-6 and fight 3898-8 against us, and [so] get them up 5927-1 out of the land. 776
1:11 Therefore they did set 7760-4 over them taskmasters 4522 8269 to afflict 6031-15 them with their burdens. 5450 And they built 1129-4 for Pharaoh 6547 treasure 4543 cities, 5892 Pithom 6619 and Raamses. 7486
1:12 But the more they afflicted 6031-17 them, the more 3651 they multiplied 7235-4 and 3651 grew. 6555-4 And they were grieved 6973-4 because 6440 of the children 1121 of Israel. 3478
1:13 And the Egyptians 4714 made the children 1121 of Israel 3478 to serve 5647-55 with rigour: 6531
1:14 And they made their lives 2416 bitter 4843-17 with hard 7186 bondage, 5656 in morter, 2563 and in brick, 3843 and in all manner of service 5656 in the field: 7704 all their service, 5656 wherein they made them serve, 5647-1 [was] with rigour. 6531
1:15 And the king 4428 of Egypt 4714 spake 559-4 to the Hebrew 5680 midwives, 3205-18 of which the name 8034 of the one 259 [was] Shiphrah, 8236 and the name 8034 of the other 8145 Puah: 6326
1:16 And he said, 559-4 When ye do the office of a midwife 3205-15 to the Hebrew women, 5680 and see 7200-1 [them] upon the stools; 70 if it [be] a son, 1121 then ye shall kill 4191-52 him: but if it [be] a daughter, 1323 then she shall live. 2425-1
1:17 But the midwives 3205-18 feared 3372-4 God, 430 and did 6213-1 not as the king 4428 of Egypt 4714 commanded 1696-14 them, but saved the men children 3206 alive. 2421-17
1:18 And the king 4428 of Egypt 4714 called 7121-4 for the midwives, 3205-18 and said 559-4 unto them, Why 4069 have ye done 6213-1 this thing, 1697 and have saved the men children 3206 alive? 2421-17
1:19 And the midwives 3205-18 said 559-4 unto Pharaoh, 6547 Because the Hebrew women 5680 [are] not as the Egyptian 4713 women; 802 for they [are] lively, 2422 and are delivered 3205-1 ere 2962 the midwives 3205-18 come in 935-4 unto them.
1:20 Therefore God 430 dealt well 3190-55 with the midwives: 3205-18 and the people 5971 multiplied, 7235-4 and waxed very 3966 mighty. 6105-4
1:21 And it came to pass, because the midwives 3205-18 feared 3372-1 God, 430 that he made 6213-4 them houses. 1004
1:22 And Pharaoh 6547 charged 6680-17 all his people, 5971 saying, 559-2 Every son 1121 that is born 3209 ye shall cast 7993-55 into the river, 2975 and every daughter 1323 ye shall save alive. 2421-17
2:1 And there went 3212-4 a man 376 of the house 1004 of Levi, 3878 and took 3947-4 [to wife] a daughter 1323 of Levi. 3878
2:2 And the woman 802 conceived, 2029-4 and bare 3205-4 a son: 1121 and when she saw 7200-4 him that he [was a] goodly 2896 [child], she hid 6845-4 him three 7969 months. 3391
2:3 And when she could 3201-1 not longer 5750 hide 6845-53 him, she took 3947-4 for him an ark 8392 of bulrushes, 1573 and daubed 2560-4 it with slime 2564 and with pitch, 2203 and put 7760-4 the child 3206 therein; and she laid 7760-4 [it] in the flags 5488 by the river's 2975 brink. 8193
2:4 And his sister 269 stood 3320-101 afar off, 7350 to wit 3045-2 what would be done 6213-11 to him.
2:5 And the daughter 1323 of Pharaoh 6547 came down 3381-4 to wash 7364-2 [herself] at the river; 2975 and her maidens 5291 walked 1980-6 along by the river's 2975 side; 3027 and when she saw 7200-4 the ark 8392 among 8432 the flags, 5488 she sent 7971-4 her maid 519 to fetch 3947-4 it.
2:6 And when she had opened 6605-4 [it], she saw 7200-4 the child: 3206 and, behold, the babe 5288 wept. 1058-6 And she had compassion 2550-4 on him, and said, 559-4 This [is one] of the Hebrews' 5680 children. 3206
2:7 Then said 559-4 his sister 269 to Pharaoh's 6547 daughter, 1323 Shall I go 3212-4 and call 7121-1 to thee a nurse 802 3243-56 of the Hebrew women, 5680 that she may nurse 3243-55 the child 3206 for thee?
2:8 And Pharaoh's 6547 daughter 1323 said 559-4 to her, Go. 3212-3 And the maid 5959 went 3212-4 and called 7121-4 the child's 3206 mother. 517
2:9 And Pharaoh's 6547 daughter 1323 said 559-4 unto her, Take 3212-54 this child 3206 away, and nurse 3243-54 it for me, and I will give 5414-4 [thee] thy wages. 7939 And the woman 802 took 3947-4 the child, 3206 and nursed 5134-55 it.
2:10 And the child 3206 grew, 1431-4 and she brought 935-55 him unto Pharaoh's 6547 daughter, 1323 and he became her son. 1121 And she called 7121-4 his name 8034 Moses: 4872 and she said, 559-4 Because I drew 4871-1 him out of the water. 4325
2:11 And it came to pass in those days, 3117 when Moses 4872 was grown, 1431-4 that he went out 3318-4 unto his brethren, 251 and looked 7200-4 on their burdens: 5450 and he spied 7200-4 an Egyptian 4713 376 smiting 5221-56 an Hebrew, 5680 376 one of his brethren. 251
2:12 And he looked 6437-4 this way 3541 and that way, 3541 and when he saw 7200-4 that [there was] no man, 376 he slew 5221-55 the Egyptian, 4713 and hid 2934-4 him in the sand. 2344
2:13 And when he went out 3318-4 the second 8145 day, 3117 behold, two 8147 men 582 of the Hebrews 5680 strove 5327-12 together: and he said 559-4 to him that did the wrong, 7563 Wherefore smitest 5221-55 thou thy fellow? 7453
2:14 And he said, 559-4 Who made 7760-1 thee 376 a prince 8269 and a judge 8199-6 over us? intendest 559-6 thou to kill 2026-2 me, as thou killedst 2026-1 the Egyptian? 4713 And Moses 4872 feared, 3372-4 and said, 559-4 Surely 403 this thing 1697 is known. 3045-8
2:15 Now when Pharaoh 6547 heard 8085-4 this thing, 1697 he sought 1245-17 to slay 2026-2 Moses. 4872 But Moses 4872 fled 1272-4 from the face 6440 of Pharaoh, 6547 and dwelt 3427-4 in the land 776 of Midian: 4080 and he sat down 3427-4 by a well. 875
2:16 Now the priest 3548 of Midian 4080 had seven 7651 daughters: 1323 and they came 935-4 and drew 1802-4 [water], and filled 4390-17 the troughs 7298 to water 8248-53 their father's 1 flock. 6629
2:17 And the shepherds 7462-6 came 935-4 and drove them away: 1644-17 but Moses 4872 stood up 6965-4 and helped 3467-55 them, and watered 8248-55 their flock. 6629
2:18 And when they came 935-4 to Reuel 7467 their father, 1 he said, 559-4 How 4069 [is it that] ye are come 935-2 so soon 4116-14 to day? 3117
2:19 And they said, 559-4 An Egyptian 4713 376 delivered 5337-52 us out of the hand 3027 of the shepherds, 7462-6 and also drew 1802-1 [water] enough 1802-2 for us, and watered 8248-55 the flock. 6629
2:20 And he said 559-4 unto his daughters, 1323 And where [is] he? why [is] it [that] ye have left 5800-1 the man? 376 call 7121-3 him, that he may eat 398-4 bread. 3899
2:21 And Moses 4872 was content 2974-55 to dwell 3427-2 with the man: 376 and he gave 5414-4 Moses 4872 Zipporah 6855 his daughter. 1323
2:22 And she bare 3205-4 [him] a son, 1121 and he called 7121-4 his name 8034 Gershom: 1647 for he said, 559-1 I have been a stranger 1616 in a strange 5237 land. 776
2:23 And it came to pass in process 1992 7227 of time, 3117 that the king 4428 of Egypt 4714 died: 4191-4 and the children 1121 of Israel 3478 sighed 584-11 by reason of 4480 the bondage, 5656 and they cried, 2199-4 and their cry 7775 came up 5927-4 unto God 430 by reason of the bondage. 5656
2:24 And God 430 heard 8085-4 their groaning, 5009 and God 430 remembered 2142-4 his covenant 1285 with Abraham, 85 with Isaac, 3327 and with Jacob. 3290
2:25 And God 430 looked 7200-4 upon the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and God 430 had respect 3045-4 unto [them].
3:1 Now Moses 4872 kept 1961-1 7462-6 the flock 6629 of Jethro 3503 his father in law, 2859-6 the priest 3548 of Midian: 4080 and he led 5090-4 the flock 6629 to the backside 310 of the desert, 4057 and came 935-4 to the mountain 2022 of God, 430 [even] to Horeb. 2722
3:2 And the angel 4397 of the LORD 3068 appeared 7200-11 unto him in a flame 3827 of fire 784 out of the midst 8432 of a bush: 5572 and he looked, 7200-4 and, behold, the bush 5572 burned 1197-6 with fire, 784 and the bush 5572 [was] not consumed. 398-30
3:3 And Moses 4872 said, 559-4 I will now turn aside, 5493-4 and see 7200-4 this great 1419 sight, 4758 why 4069 the bush 5572 is not burnt. 1197-4
3:4 And when the LORD 3068 saw 7200-4 that he turned aside 5493-1 to see, 7200-2 God 430 called 7121-4 unto him out of the midst 8432 of the bush, 5572 and said, 559-4 Moses, 4872 Moses. 4872 And he said, 559-4 Here [am] I.
3:5 And he said, 559-4 Draw not nigh 7126-4 hither: 1988 put off 5394-3 thy shoes 5275 from off thy feet, 7272 for the place 4725 whereon 834 thou standest 5975-6 [is] holy 6944 ground. 127
3:6 Moreover he said, 559-4 I [am] the God 430 of thy father, 1 the God 430 of Abraham, 85 the God 430 of Isaac, 3327 and the God 430 of Jacob. 3290 And Moses 4872 hid 5641-55 his face; 6440 for he was afraid 3372-1 to look 5027-53 upon God. 430
3:7 And the LORD 3068 said, 559-4 I have surely 7200-2 seen 7200-1 the affliction 6040 of my people 5971 which [are] in Egypt, 4714 and have heard 8085-1 their cry 6818 by reason 6440 of their taskmasters; 5065-6 for I know 3045-1 their sorrows; 4341
3:8 And I am come down 3381-4 to deliver 5337-53 them out of the hand 3027 of the Egyptians, 4714 and to bring them up 5927-53 out of that land 776 unto a good 2896 land 776 and a large, 7342 unto a land 776 flowing 2100-6 with milk 2461 and honey; 1706 unto the place 4725 of the Canaanites, 3669 and the Hittites, 2850 and the Amorites, 567 and the Perizzites, 6522 and the Hivites, 2340 and the Jebusites. 2983
3:9 Now therefore, behold, the cry 6818 of the children 1121 of Israel 3478 is come 935-1 unto me: and I have also seen 7200-1 the oppression 3906 wherewith the Egyptians 4714 oppress 3905-5 them.
3:10 Come 3212-3 now therefore, and I will send 7971-4 thee unto Pharaoh, 6547 that thou mayest bring forth 3318-54 my people 5971 the children 1121 of Israel 3478 out of Egypt. 4714
3:11 And Moses 4872 said 559-4 unto God, 430 Who [am] I, that I should go 3212-4 unto Pharaoh, 6547 and that I should bring forth 3318-55 the children 1121 of Israel 3478 out of Egypt? 4714
3:12 And he said, 559-4 Certainly 3588 I will be with thee; and this [shall be] a token 226 unto thee, that I have sent 7971-1 thee: When thou hast brought forth 3318-53 the people 5971 out of Egypt, 4714 ye shall serve 5647-4 God 430 upon this mountain. 2022
3:13 And Moses 4872 said 559-4 unto God, 430 Behold, [when] I come 935-6 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and shall say 559-1 unto them, The God 430 of your fathers 1 hath sent 7971-1 me unto you; and they shall say 559-1 to me, What [is] his name? 8034 what shall I say 559-4 unto them?
3:14 And God 430 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 I AM 1961-4 THAT I AM: 1961-4 and he said, 559-4 Thus shalt thou say 559-4 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 I AM hath sent 7971-1 me unto you.
3:15 And God 430 said 559-4 moreover 5750 unto Moses, 4872 Thus shalt thou say 559-4 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 The LORD 3068 God 430 of your fathers, 1 the God 430 of Abraham, 85 the God 430 of Isaac, 3327 and the God 430 of Jacob, 3290 hath sent 7971-1 me unto you: this [is] my name 8034 for ever, 5769 and this [is] my memorial 2143 unto all 1755 generations. 1755
3:16 Go, 3212-3 and gather 622-1 the elders 2205 of Israel 3478 together, and say 559-1 unto them, The LORD 3068 God 430 of your fathers, 1 the God 430 of Abraham, 85 of Isaac, 3327 and of Jacob, 3290 appeared 7200-8 unto me, saying, 559-2 I have surely 6485-2 visited 6485-1 you, and [seen] that which is done 6213-7 to you in Egypt: 4714
3:17 And I have said, 559-4 I will bring you up 5927-55 out of the affliction 6040 of Egypt 4714 unto the land 776 of the Canaanites, 3669 and the Hittites, 2850 and the Amorites, 567 and the Perizzites, 6522 and the Hivites, 2340 and the Jebusites, 2983 unto a land 776 flowing 2100-6 with milk 2461 and honey. 1706
3:18 And they shall hearken 8085-1 to thy voice: 6963 and thou shalt come, 935-1 thou and the elders 2205 of Israel, 3478 unto the king 4428 of Egypt, 4714 and ye shall say 559-1 unto him, The LORD 3068 God 430 of the Hebrews 5680 hath met 7136-8 with us: and now let us go, 3212-4 we beseech thee, three 7969 days' 3117 journey 1870 into the wilderness, 4057 that we may sacrifice 2076-4 to the LORD 3068 our God. 430
3:19 And I am sure 3045-1 that the king 4428 of Egypt 4714 will not let 5414-4 you go, 1980-2 no, not by a mighty 2389 hand. 3027
3:20 And I will stretch out 7971-1 my hand, 3027 and smite 5221-52 Egypt 4714 with all my wonders 6381-12 which I will do 6213-4 in the midst 7130 thereof: and after 310 that he will let you go. 7971-17
3:21 And I will give 5414-1 this people 5971 favour 2580 in the sight 5869 of the Egyptians: 4714 and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, 3212-4 ye shall not go 3212-4 empty: 7387
3:22 But every woman 802 shall borrow 7592-1 of her neighbour, 7934 and of her that sojourneth 1481-6 in her house, 1004 jewels 3627 of silver, 3701 and jewels 3627 of gold, 2091 and raiment: 8071 and ye shall put 7760-1 [them] upon your sons, 1121 and upon your daughters; 1323 and ye shall spoil 5337-14 the Egyptians. 4714
4:1 And Moses 4872 answered 6030-4 and said, 559-4 But, behold, they will not believe 539-55 me, nor hearken 8085-4 unto my voice: 6963 for they will say, 559-4 The LORD 3068 hath not appeared 7200-8 unto thee.
4:2 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto him, What [is] that in thine hand? 3027 And he said, 559-4 A rod. 4294
4:3 And he said, 559-4 Cast 7993-54 it on the ground. 776 And he cast 7993-55 it on the ground, 776 and it became a serpent; 5175 and Moses 4872 fled 5127-4 from before 6440 it.
4:4 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Put forth 7971-3 thine hand, 3027 and take 270-3 it by the tail. 2180 And he put forth 7971-4 his hand, 3027 and caught 2388-55 it, and it became a rod 4294 in his hand: 3709
4:5 That they may believe 539-55 that the LORD 3068 God 430 of their fathers, 1 the God 430 of Abraham, 85 the God 430 of Isaac, 3327 and the God 430 of Jacob, 3290 hath appeared 7200-8 unto thee.
4:6 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 furthermore 5750 unto him, Put 935-54 now thine hand 3027 into thy bosom. 2436 And he put 935-55 his hand 3027 into his bosom: 2436 and when he took it out, 3318-55 behold, his hand 3027 [was] leprous 6879-30 as snow. 7950
4:7 And he said, 559-4 Put thine hand 3027 into thy bosom 2436 again. 7725-54 And he put his hand 3027 into his bosom 2436 again; 7725-55 and plucked it out 3318-55 of his bosom, 2436 and, behold, it was turned 7725-1 again as his [other] flesh. 1320
4:8 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe 539-55 thee, neither hearken 8085-4 to the voice 6963 of the first 7223 sign, 226 that they will believe 539-52 the voice 6963 of the latter 314 sign. 226
4:9 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe 539-55 also these two 8147 signs, 226 neither hearken 8085-4 unto thy voice, 6963 that thou shalt take 3947-1 of the water 4325 of the river, 2975 and pour 8210-1 [it] upon the dry 3004 [land]: and the water 4325 which thou takest 3947-4 out of the river 2975 shall become blood 1818 upon the dry 3006 [land].
4:10 And Moses 4872 said 559-4 unto the LORD, 3068 O 994 my Lord, 136 I 376 [am] not eloquent, 1697 neither heretofore, 8032 8543 nor since 227 thou hast spoken 1696-15 unto thy servant: 5650 but I [am] slow 3515 of speech, 6310 and of a slow 3515 tongue. 3956
4:11 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto him, Who hath made 7760-1 man's 120 mouth? 6310 or who maketh 7760-4 the dumb, 483 or deaf, 2795 or the seeing, 6493 or the blind? 5787 have not I the LORD? 3068
4:12 Now therefore go, 3212-3 and I will be with thy mouth, 6310 and teach 3384-52 thee what thou shalt say. 1696-17
4:13 And he said, 559-4 O 994 my Lord, 136 send, 7971-3 I pray thee, by the hand 3027 [of him whom] thou wilt send. 7971-4
4:14 And the anger 639 of the LORD 3068 was kindled 2734-4 against Moses, 4872 and he said, 559-4 [Is] not Aaron 175 the Levite 3881 thy brother? 251 I know 3045-1 that he can speak 1696-17 well. 1696-15 And also, behold, he cometh forth 3318-6 to meet 7125-2 thee: and when he seeth 7200-1 thee, he will be glad 8055-1 in his heart. 3820
4:15 And thou shalt speak 1696-14 unto him, and put 7760-1 words 1697 in his mouth: 6310 and I will be with thy mouth, 6310 and with his mouth, 6310 and will teach 3384-52 you what ye shall do. 6213-4
4:16 And he shall be thy spokesman 1696-14 unto the people: 5971 and he shall be, [even] he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, 6310 and thou shalt be to him instead of God. 430
4:17 And thou shalt take 3947-4 this rod 4294 in thine hand, 3027 wherewith thou shalt do 6213-4 signs. 226
4:18 And Moses 4872 went 3212-4 and returned 7725-4 to Jethro 3500 his father in law, 2859-6 and said 559-4 unto him, Let me go, 3212-4 I pray thee, and return 7725-4 unto my brethren 251 which [are] in Egypt, 4714 and see 7200-4 whether they be yet 5750 alive. 2416 And Jethro 3503 said 559-4 to Moses, 4872 Go 3212-3 in peace. 7965
4:19 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses 4872 in Midian, 4080 Go, 3212-3 return 7725-3 into Egypt: 4714 for all the men 582 are dead 4191-1 which sought 1245-18 thy life. 5315
4:20 And Moses 4872 took 3947-4 his wife 802 and his sons, 1121 and set 7392-55 them upon an ass, 2543 and he returned 7725-4 to the land 776 of Egypt: 4714 and Moses 4872 took 3947-4 the rod 4294 of God 430 in his hand. 3027
4:21 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 When thou goest 3212-2 to return 7725-2 into Egypt, 4714 see 7200-3 that thou do 6213-1 all those wonders 4159 before 6440 Pharaoh, 6547 which I have put 7760-1 in thine hand: 3027 but I will harden 2388-17 his heart, 3820 that he shall not let the people 5971 go. 7971-17
4:22 And thou shalt say 559-1 unto Pharaoh, 6547 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Israel 3478 [is] my son, 1121 [even] my firstborn: 1060
4:23 And I say 559-4 unto thee, Let my son 1121 go, 7971-16 that he may serve 5647-4 me: and if thou refuse 3985-17 to let him go, 7971-15 behold, I will slay 2026-6 thy son, 1121 [even] thy firstborn. 1060
4:24 And it came to pass by the way 1870 in the inn, 4411 that the LORD 3068 met 6298-4 him, and sought 1245-17 to kill 4191-53 him.
4:25 Then Zipporah 6855 took 3947-4 a sharp stone, 6864 and cut off 3772-4 the foreskin 6190 of her son, 1121 and cast 5060-55 [it] at his feet, 7272 and said, 559-4 Surely a bloody 1818 husband 2860 [art] thou to me.
4:26 So he let him go: 7503-4 then she said, 559-1 A bloody 1818 husband 2860 [thou art], because of the circumcision. 4139
4:27 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 to Aaron, 175 Go 3212-3 into the wilderness 4057 to meet 7125-2 Moses. 4872 And he went, 3212-4 and met 6298-4 him in the mount 2022 of God, 430 and kissed 5401-4 him.
4:28 And Moses 4872 told 5046-55 Aaron 175 all the words 1697 of the LORD 3068 who had sent 7971-1 him, and all the signs 226 which he had commanded 6680-14 him.
4:29 And Moses 4872 and Aaron 175 went 3212-4 and gathered 622-4 together all the elders 2205 of the children 1121 of Israel: 3478
4:30 And Aaron 175 spake 1696-17 all the words 1697 which the LORD 3068 had spoken 1696-14 unto Moses, 4872 and did 6213-4 the signs 226 in the sight 5869 of the people. 5971
4:31 And the people 5971 believed: 539-55 and when they heard 8085-4 that the LORD 3068 had visited 6485-1 the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and that he had looked 7200-1 upon their affliction, 6040 then they bowed their heads 6915-4 and worshipped. 7812-101
5:1 And afterward 310 Moses 4872 and Aaron 175 went in, 935-1 and told 559-4 Pharaoh, 6547 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel, 3478 Let my people 5971 go, 7971-16 that they may hold a feast 2287-4 unto me in the wilderness. 4057
5:2 And Pharaoh 6547 said, 559-4 Who [is] the LORD, 3068 that I should obey 8085-4 his voice 6963 to let Israel 3478 go? 7971-15 I know 3045-1 not the LORD, 3068 neither will I let Israel 3478 go. 7971-17
5:3 And they said, 559-4 The God 430 of the Hebrews 5680 hath met 7122-8 with us: let us go, 3212-4 we pray thee, three 7969 days' 3117 journey 1870 into the desert, 4057 and sacrifice 2076-4 unto the LORD 3068 our God; 430 lest he fall 6293-4 upon us with pestilence, 1698 or with the sword. 2719
5:4 And the king 4428 of Egypt 4714 said 559-4 unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses 4872 and Aaron, 175 let 6544-55 the people 5971 from their works? 4639 get 3212-3 you unto your burdens. 5450
5:5 And Pharaoh 6547 said, 559-4 Behold, the people 5971 of the land 776 now [are] many, 7227 and ye make them rest 7673-52 from their burdens. 5450
5:6 And Pharaoh 6547 commanded 6680-17 the same day 3117 the taskmasters 5065-6 of the people, 5971 and their officers, 7860-6 saying, 559-2
5:7 Ye shall no more 3254-55 give 5414-2 the people 5971 straw 8401 to make 3835-2 brick, 3843 as heretofore: 8032 8543 let them go 3212-4 and gather 7197-22 straw 8401 for themselves.
5:8 And the tale 4971 of the bricks, 3843 which they did make 6213-6 heretofore, 8032 8543 ye shall lay 7760-4 upon them; ye shall not diminish 1639-4 [ought] thereof: for they [be] idle; 7503-12 therefore they cry, 6817-6 saying, 559-2 Let us go 3212-4 [and] sacrifice 2076-4 to our God. 430
5:9 Let there more work 5656 be laid 3513-4 upon the men, 582 that they may labour 6213-4 therein; and let them not regard 8159-4 vain 8267 words. 1697
5:10 And the taskmasters 5065-6 of the people 5971 went out, 3318-4 and their officers, 7860-6 and they spake 559-4 to the people, 5971 saying, 559-2 Thus saith 559-1 Pharaoh, 6547 I will not give 5414-6 you straw. 8401
5:11 Go 3212-3 ye, get 3947-3 you straw 8401 where 834 ye can find 4672-4 it: yet 3588 not ought 1697 of your work 5656 shall be diminished. 1639-12
5:12 So the people 5971 were scattered abroad 6327-55 throughout all the land 776 of Egypt 4714 to gather 7197-23 stubble 7179 instead of straw. 8401
5:13 And the taskmasters 5065-6 hasted 213-5 [them], saying, 559-2 Fulfil 3615-16 your works, 4639 [your] daily 3117 3117 tasks, 1697 as when there was 1961-2 straw. 8401
5:14 And the officers 7860-6 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 which Pharaoh's 6547 taskmasters 5065-6 had set 7760-1 over them, were beaten, 5221-93 [and] demanded, 559-2 Wherefore have ye not fulfilled 3615-14 your task 2706 in making brick 3835-2 both yesterday 8543 and to day, 3117 as heretofore? 8032 8543
5:15 Then the officers 7860-6 of the children 1121 of Israel 3478 came 935-4 and cried 6817-4 unto Pharaoh, 6547 saying, 559-2 Wherefore dealest 6213-4 thou thus with thy servants? 5650
5:16 There is no straw 8401 given 5414-12 unto thy servants, 5650 and they say 559-6 to us, Make 6213-3 brick: 3843 and, behold, thy servants 5650 [are] beaten; 5221-94 but the fault 2398-1 [is] in thine own people. 5971
5:17 But he said, 559-4 Ye [are] idle, 7503-12 [ye are] idle: 7503-12 therefore ye say, 559-6 Let us go 3212-4 [and] do sacrifice 2076-4 to the LORD. 3068
5:18 Go 3212-3 therefore now, [and] work; 5647-3 for there shall no straw 8401 be given 5414-11 you, yet shall ye deliver 5414-4 the tale 8506 of bricks. 3843
5:19 And the officers 7860-6 of the children 1121 of Israel 3478 did see 7200-4 [that] they [were] in evil 7451 [case], after it was said, 559-2 Ye shall not minish 1639-4 [ought] from your bricks 3843 of your daily 3117 3117 task. 1697
5:20 And they met 6293-4 Moses 4872 and Aaron, 175 who stood 5324-12 in the way, 7125-2 as they came forth 3318-2 from Pharaoh: 6547
5:21 And they said 559-4 unto them, The LORD 3068 look 7200-4 upon you, and judge; 8199-4 because ye have made our savour 7381 to be abhorred 887-52 in the eyes 5869 of Pharaoh, 6547 and in the eyes 5869 of his servants, 5650 to put 5414-2 a sword 2719 in their hand 3027 to slay 2026-2 us.
5:22 And Moses 4872 returned 7725-4 unto the LORD, 3068 and said, 559-4 Lord, 136 wherefore hast thou [so] evil entreated 7489-52 this people? 5971 why [is] it [that] thou hast sent 7971-1 me?
5:23 For since I came 935-1 to Pharaoh 6547 to speak 1696-15 in thy name, 8034 he hath done evil 7489-52 to this people; 5971 neither hast thou delivered 5337-52 thy people 5971 at all. 5337-53
6:1 Then the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Now shalt thou see 7200-4 what I will do 6213-4 to Pharaoh: 6547 for with a strong 2389 hand 3027 shall he let them go, 7971-17 and with a strong 2389 hand 3027 shall he drive them out 1644-17 of his land. 776
6:2 And God 430 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 and said 559-4 unto him, I [am] the LORD: 3068
6:3 And I appeared 7200-11 unto Abraham, 85 unto Isaac, 3327 and unto Jacob, 3290 by [the name of] God 410 Almighty, 7706 but by my name 8034 JEHOVAH 3068 was I not known 3045-8 to them.
6:4 And I have also established 6965-52 my covenant 1285 with them, to give 5414-2 them the land 776 of Canaan, 3667 the land 776 of their pilgrimage, 4033 wherein they were strangers. 1481-1
6:5 And I have also heard 8085-1 the groaning 5009 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 whom 834 the Egyptians 4714 keep in bondage; 5647-56 and I have remembered 2142-4 my covenant. 1285
6:6 Wherefore 3651 say 559-3 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 I [am] the LORD, 3068 and I will bring you out 3318-52 from under the burdens 5450 of the Egyptians, 4714 and I will rid 5337-52 you out of their bondage, 5656 and I will redeem 1350-1 you with a stretched out 5186-7 arm, 2220 and with great 1419 judgments: 8201
6:7 And I will take 3947-1 you to me for a people, 5971 and I will be to you a God: 430 and ye shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD 3068 your God, 430 which bringeth you out 3318-56 from under the burdens 5450 of the Egyptians. 4714
6:8 And I will bring 935-52 you in unto the land, 776 concerning the which I did 5375-1 swear 3027 to give 5414-2 it to Abraham, 85 to Isaac, 3327 and to Jacob; 3290 and I will give 5414-1 it you for an heritage: 4181 I [am] the LORD. 3068
6:9 And Moses 4872 spake 1696-17 so unto the children 1121 of Israel: 3478 but they hearkened 8085-1 not unto Moses 4872 for anguish 7115 of spirit, 7307 and for cruel 7186 bondage. 5656
6:10 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2
6:11 Go in, 935-3 speak 1696-16 unto Pharaoh 6547 king 4428 of Egypt, 4714 that he let the children 1121 of Israel 3478 go 7971-17 out of his land. 776
6:12 And Moses 4872 spake 1696-17 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 saying, 559-2 Behold, the children 1121 of Israel 3478 have not hearkened 8085-1 unto me; how then shall Pharaoh 6547 hear 8085-4 me, who 589 [am] of uncircumcised 6189 lips? 8193
6:13 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses 4872 and unto Aaron, 175 and gave them a charge 6680-17 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and unto Pharaoh 6547 king 4428 of Egypt, 4714 to bring the children 1121 of Israel 3478 out 3318-53 of the land 776 of Egypt. 4714
6:14 These [be] the heads 7218 of their fathers' 1 houses: 1004 The sons 1121 of Reuben 7205 the firstborn 1060 of Israel; 3478 Hanoch, 2585 and Pallu, 6396 Hezron, 2696 and Carmi: 3756 these [be] the families 4940 of Reuben. 7205
6:15 And the sons 1121 of Simeon; 8095 Jemuel, 3223 and Jamin, 3226 and Ohad, 161 and Jachin, 3199 and Zohar, 6714 and Shaul 7586 the son 1121 of a Canaanitish woman: 3669 these [are] the families 4940 of Simeon. 8095
6:16 And these [are] the names 8034 of the sons 1121 of Levi 3878 according to their generations; 8435 Gershon, 1648 and Kohath, 6955 and Merari: 4847 and the years 8141 of the life 2416 of Levi 3878 [were] an hundred 3967 thirty 7970 and seven 7651 years. 8141
6:17 The sons 1121 of Gershon; 1648 Libni, 3845 and Shimi, 8096 according to their families. 4940
6:18 And the sons 1121 of Kohath; 6955 Amram, 6019 and Izhar, 3324 and Hebron, 2275 and Uzziel: 5816 and the years 8141 of the life 2416 of Kohath 6955 [were] an hundred 3967 thirty 7970 and three 7969 years. 8141
6:19 And the sons 1121 of Merari; 4847 Mahali 4249 and Mushi: 4187 these [are] the families 4940 of Levi 3878 according to their generations. 8435
6:20 And Amram 6019 took 3947-4 him Jochebed 3115 his father's sister 1733 to wife; 802 and she bare 3205-4 him Aaron 175 and Moses: 4872 and the years 8141 of the life 2416 of Amram 6019 [were] an hundred 3967 and thirty 7970 and seven 7651 years. 8141
6:21 And the sons 1121 of Izhar; 3324 Korah, 7141 and Nepheg, 5298 and Zichri. 2147
6:22 And the sons 1121 of Uzziel; 5816 Mishael, 4332 and Elzaphan, 469 and Zithri. 5644
6:23 And Aaron 175 took 3947-4 him Elisheba, 472 daughter 1323 of Amminadab, 5992 sister 269 of Naashon, 5177 to wife; 802 and she bare 3205-4 him Nadab, 5070 and Abihu, 30 Eleazar, 499 and Ithamar. 385
6:24 And the sons 1121 of Korah; 7141 Assir, 617 and Elkanah, 511 and Abiasaph: 23 these [are] the families 4940 of the Korhites. 7145
6:25 And Eleazar 499 Aaron's 175 son 1121 took 3947-1 him [one] of the daughters 1323 of Putiel 6317 to wife; 802 and she bare 3205-4 him Phinehas: 6372 these [are] the heads 7218 of the fathers 1 of the Levites 3881 according to their families. 4940
6:26 These 1931 [are] that Aaron 175 and Moses, 4872 to whom 834 the LORD 3068 said, 559-1 Bring out 3318-54 the children 1121 of Israel 3478 from the land 776 of Egypt 4714 according to their armies. 6635
6:27 These [are] they 1992 which spake 1696-18 to Pharaoh 6547 king 4428 of Egypt, 4714 to bring out 3318-53 the children 1121 of Israel 3478 from Egypt: 4714 these [are] that Moses 4872 and Aaron. 175
6:28 And it came to pass on the day 3117 [when] the LORD 3068 spake 1696-15 unto Moses 4872 in the land 776 of Egypt, 4714
6:29 That the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2 I [am] the LORD: 3068 speak 1696-16 thou unto Pharaoh 6547 king 4428 of Egypt 4714 all that I say 1696-6 unto thee.
6:30 And Moses 4872 said 559-4 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 Behold, I [am] of uncircumcised 6189 lips, 8193 and how shall Pharaoh 6547 hearken 8085-4 unto me?
7:1 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 See, 7200-3 I have made 5414-1 thee a god 430 to Pharaoh: 6547 and Aaron 175 thy brother 251 shall be thy prophet. 5030
7:2 Thou shalt speak 1696-17 all that I command 6680-17 thee: and Aaron 175 thy brother 251 shall speak 1696-17 unto Pharaoh, 6547 that he send 7971-14 the children 1121 of Israel 3478 out of his land. 776
7:3 And I will harden 7185-55 Pharaoh's 6547 heart, 3820 and multiply 7235-52 my signs 226 and my wonders 4159 in the land 776 of Egypt. 4714
7:4 But Pharaoh 6547 shall not hearken 8085-4 unto you, that I may lay 5414-1 my hand 3027 upon Egypt, 4714 and bring forth 3318-52 mine armies, 6635 [and] my people 5971 the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 out of the land 776 of Egypt 4714 by great 1419 judgments. 8201
7:5 And the Egyptians 4714 shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD, 3068 when I stretch forth 5186-2 mine hand 3027 upon Egypt, 4714 and bring out 3318-52 the children 1121 of Israel 3478 from among 8432 them.
7:6 And Moses 4872 and Aaron 175 did 6213-4 as the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 them, so did 6213-1 they.
7:7 And Moses 4872 [was] fourscore 8084 years 8141 old, 1121 and Aaron 175 fourscore 8084 and three 7969 years 8141 old, 1121 when they spake 1696-15 unto Pharaoh. 6547
7:8 And the LORD 3068 spake 559-4 unto Moses 4872 and unto Aaron, 175 saying, 559-2
7:9 When Pharaoh 6547 shall speak 1696-17 unto you, saying, 559-2 Shew 5414-3 a miracle 4159 for you: then thou shalt say 559-1 unto Aaron, 175 Take 3947-3 thy rod, 4294 and cast 7993-54 [it] before 6440 Pharaoh, 6547 [and] it shall become a serpent. 8577
7:10 And Moses 4872 and Aaron 175 went in 935-4 unto Pharaoh, 6547 and they did 6213-4 so as the LORD 3068 had commanded: 6680-14 and Aaron 175 cast down 7993-55 his rod 4294 before 6440 Pharaoh, 6547 and before 6440 his servants, 5650 and it became a serpent. 8577
7:11 Then Pharaoh 6547 also called 7121-4 the wise men 2450 and the sorcerers: 3784-18 now the magicians 2748 of Egypt, 4714 they also did 6213-4 in like manner 3651 with their enchantments. 3858
7:12 For they cast down 7993-55 every man 376 his rod, 4294 and they became serpents: 8577 but Aaron's 175 rod 4294 swallowed up 1104-4 their rods. 4294
7:13 And he hardened 2388-4 Pharaoh's 6547 heart, 3820 that he hearkened 8085-1 not unto them; as the LORD 3068 had said. 1696-14
7:14 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Pharaoh's 6547 heart 3820 [is] hardened, 3515 he refuseth 3985-14 to let the people 5971 go. 7971-15
7:15 Get 3212-3 thee unto Pharaoh 6547 in the morning; 1242 lo, he goeth out 3318-6 unto the water; 4325 and thou shalt stand 5324-8 by the river's 2975 brink 8193 against he come; 7125-2 and the rod 4294 which was turned 2015-8 to a serpent 5175 shalt thou take 3947-4 in thine hand. 3027
7:16 And thou shalt say 559-1 unto him, The LORD 3068 God 430 of the Hebrews 5680 hath sent 7971-1 me unto thee, saying, 559-2 Let my people 5971 go, 7971-16 that they may serve 5647-4 me in the wilderness: 4057 and, behold, hitherto 3541 thou wouldest not hear. 8085-1
7:17 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 In this thou shalt know 3045-4 that I [am] the LORD: 3068 behold, I will smite 5221-56 with the rod 4294 that [is] in mine hand 3027 upon the waters 4325 which [are] in the river, 2975 and they shall be turned 2015-8 to blood. 1818
7:18 And the fish 1710 that [is] in the river 2975 shall die, 4191-4 and the river 2975 shall stink; 887-1 and the Egyptians 4714 shall lothe 3811-8 to drink 8354-2 of the water 4325 of the river. 2975
7:19 And the LORD 3068 spake 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Say 559-3 unto Aaron, 175 Take 3947-3 thy rod, 4294 and stretch out 5186-3 thine hand 3027 upon the waters 4325 of Egypt, 4714 upon their streams, 5104 upon their rivers, 2975 and upon their ponds, 98 and upon all their pools 4723 of water, 4325 that they may become blood; 1818 and [that] there may be blood 1818 throughout all the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 both in [vessels of] wood, 6086 and in [vessels of] stone. 68
7:20 And Moses 4872 and Aaron 175 did 6213-4 so, as the LORD 3068 commanded; 6680-14 and he lifted up 7311-55 the rod, 4294 and smote 5221-55 the waters 4325 that [were] in the river, 2975 in the sight 5869 of Pharaoh, 6547 and in the sight 5869 of his servants; 5650 and all the waters 4325 that [were] in the river 2975 were turned 2015-11 to blood. 1818
7:21 And the fish 1710 that [was] in the river 2975 died; 4191-1 and the river 2975 stank, 887-4 and the Egyptians 4714 could 3201-1 not drink 8354-2 of the water 4325 of the river; 2975 and there was blood 1818 throughout all the land 776 of Egypt. 4714
7:22 And the magicians 2748 of Egypt 4714 did 6213-4 so with their enchantments: 3909 and Pharaoh's 6547 heart 3820 was hardened, 2388-4 neither did he hearken 8085-1 unto them; as the LORD 3068 had said. 1696-14
7:23 And Pharaoh 6547 turned 6437-4 and went 935-4 into his house, 1004 neither did he set 7896-1 his heart 3820 to this 2063 also.
7:24 And all the Egyptians 4714 digged 2658-4 round about 5439 the river 2975 for water 4325 to drink; 8354-2 for they could 3201-1 not drink 8354-2 of the water 4325 of the river. 2975
7:25 And seven 7651 days 3117 were fulfilled, 4390-11 after 310 that the LORD 3068 had smitten 5221-53 the river. 2975
8:1 And the LORD 3068 spake 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Go 935-3 unto Pharaoh, 6547 and say 559-1 unto him, Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Let my people 5971 go, 7971-16 that they may serve 5647-4 me.
8:2 And if thou refuse 3986 to let [them] go, 7971-15 behold, I will smite 5062-6 all thy borders 1366 with frogs: 6854
8:3 And the river 2975 shall bring forth frogs 6854 abundantly, 8317-1 which shall go up 5927-1 and come 935-1 into thine house, 1004 and into thy bedchamber, 2315 4904 and upon thy bed, 4296 and into the house 1004 of thy servants, 5650 and upon thy people, 5971 and into thine ovens, 8574 and into thy kneadingtroughs: 4863
8:4 And the frogs 6854 shall come up 5927-4 both on thee, and upon thy people, 5971 and upon all thy servants. 5650
8:5 And the LORD 3068 spake 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Say 559-3 unto Aaron, 175 Stretch forth 5186-3 thine hand 3027 with thy rod 4294 over the streams, 5104 over the rivers, 2975 and over the ponds, 98 and cause frogs 6854 to come up 5927-54 upon the land 776 of Egypt. 4714
8:6 And Aaron 175 stretched out 5186-4 his hand 3027 over the waters 4325 of Egypt; 4714 and the frogs 6854 came up, 5927-4 and covered 3680-17 the land 776 of Egypt. 4714
8:7 And the magicians 2748 did 6213-4 so with their enchantments, 3909 and brought up 5927-55 frogs 6854 upon the land 776 of Egypt. 4714
8:8 Then Pharaoh 6547 called 7121-4 for Moses 4872 and Aaron, 175 and said, 559-4 Intreat 6279-54 the LORD, 3068 that he may take away 5493-55 the frogs 6854 from me, and from my people; 5971 and I will let the people 5971 go, 7971-17 that they may do sacrifice 2076-4 unto the LORD. 3068
8:9 And Moses 4872 said 559-4 unto Pharaoh, 6547 Glory 6286-100 over me: when 4970 shall I intreat 6279-55 for thee, and for thy servants, 5650 and for thy people, 5971 to destroy 3772-53 the frogs 6854 from thee and thy houses, 1004 [that] they may remain 7604-11 in the river 2975 only?
8:10 And he said, 559-4 To morrow. 4279 And he said, 559-4 [Be it] according to thy word: 1697 that thou mayest know 3045-4 that [there is] none like unto the LORD 3068 our God. 430
8:11 And the frogs 6854 shall depart 5493-1 from thee, and from thy houses, 1004 and from thy servants, 5650 and from thy people; 5971 they shall remain 7604-11 in the river 2975 only.
8:12 And Moses 4872 and Aaron 175 went out 3318-4 from Pharaoh: 6547 and Moses 4872 cried 6817-4 unto the LORD 3068 because of 1697 the frogs 6854 which he had brought 7760-1 against Pharaoh. 6547
8:13 And the LORD 3068 did 6213-4 according to the word 1697 of Moses; 4872 and the frogs 6854 died 4191-4 out of the houses, 1004 out of the villages, 2691 and out of the fields. 7704
8:14 And they gathered them together 6651-4 upon heaps: 2563 and the land 776 stank. 887-4
8:15 But when Pharaoh 6547 saw 7200-4 that there was respite, 7309 he hardened 3513-53 his heart, 3820 and hearkened 8085-1 not unto them; as the LORD 3068 had said. 1696-14
8:16 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Say 559-3 unto Aaron, 175 Stretch out 5186-3 thy rod, 4294 and smite 5221-54 the dust 6083 of the land, 776 that it may become lice 3654 throughout all the land 776 of Egypt. 4714
8:17 And they did 6213-4 so; for Aaron 175 stretched out 5186-4 his hand 3027 with his rod, 4294 and smote 5221-55 the dust 6083 of the earth, 776 and it became lice 3654 in man, 120 and in beast; 929 all the dust 6083 of the land 776 became lice 3654 throughout all the land 776 of Egypt. 4714
8:18 And the magicians 2748 did 6213-4 so with their enchantments 3909 to bring forth 3318-53 lice, 3654 but they could 3201-1 not: so there were lice 3654 upon man, 120 and upon beast. 929
8:19 Then the magicians 2748 said 559-4 unto Pharaoh, 6547 This [is] the finger 676 of God: 430 and Pharaoh's 6547 heart 3820 was hardened, 2388-4 and he hearkened 8085-1 not unto them; as the LORD 3068 had said. 1696-14
8:20 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Rise up early 7925-54 in the morning, 1242 and stand 3320-100 before 6440 Pharaoh; 6547 lo, he cometh forth 3318-6 to the water; 4325 and say 559-1 unto him, Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Let my people 5971 go, 7971-16 that they may serve 5647-4 me.
8:21 Else, if thou wilt not let my people 5971 go, 7971-18 behold, I will send 7971-56 swarms 6157 [of flies] upon thee, and upon thy servants, 5650 and upon thy people, 5971 and into thy houses: 1004 and the houses 1004 of the Egyptians 4714 shall be full 4390-1 of swarms 6157 [of flies], and also the ground 127 whereon they [are].
8:22 And I will sever 6395-52 in that day 3117 the land 776 of Goshen, 1657 in which my people 5971 dwell, 5975-6 that no 1115 swarms 6157 [of flies] shall be 1961-2 there; to the end 4616 thou mayest know 3045-4 that I [am] the LORD 3068 in the midst 7130 of the earth. 776
8:23 And I will put 7760-1 a division 6304 between my people 5971 and thy people: 5971 to morrow 4279 shall this sign 226 be.
8:24 And the LORD 3068 did 6213-4 so; and there came 935-4 a grievous 3515 swarm 6157 [of flies] into the house 1004 of Pharaoh, 6547 and [into] his servants' 5650 houses, 1004 and into all the land 776 of Egypt: 4714 the land 776 was corrupted 7843-11 by reason 6440 of the swarm 6157 [of flies].
8:25 And Pharaoh 6547 called 7121-4 for 413 Moses 4872 and for Aaron, 175 and said, 559-4 Go 3212-3 ye, sacrifice 2076-3 to your God 430 in the land. 776
8:26 And Moses 4872 said, 559-4 It is not meet 3559-12 so to do; 6213-2 for we shall sacrifice 2076-4 the abomination 8441 of the Egyptians 4714 to the LORD 3068 our God: 430 lo, 2005 shall we sacrifice 2076-4 the abomination 8441 of the Egyptians 4714 before their eyes, 5869 and will they not stone 5619-4 us?
8:27 We will go 3212-4 three 7969 days' 3117 journey 1870 into the wilderness, 4057 and sacrifice 2076-1 to the LORD 3068 our God, 430 as he shall command 559-4 us.
8:28 And Pharaoh 6547 said, 559-4 I will let you go, 7971-17 that ye may sacrifice 2076-1 to the LORD 3068 your God 430 in the wilderness; 4057 only ye shall not go 3212-2 very 7368-53 far away: 7368-55 intreat 6279-54 for me. 1157
8:29 And Moses 4872 said, 559-4 Behold, I go out 3318-6 from thee, and I will intreat 6279-52 the LORD 3068 that the swarms 6157 [of flies] may depart 5493-1 from Pharaoh, 6547 from his servants, 5650 and from his people, 5971 to morrow: 4279 but 7535 let not Pharaoh 6547 deal deceitfully 2048-15 any more 3254-55 in not 1115 letting the people 5971 go 7971-15 to sacrifice 2076-2 to the LORD. 3068
8:30 And Moses 4872 went out 3318-4 from Pharaoh, 6547 and intreated 6279-4 the LORD. 3068
8:31 And the LORD 3068 did 6213-4 according to the word 1697 of Moses; 4872 and he removed 5493-55 the swarms 6157 [of flies] from Pharaoh, 6547 from his servants, 5650 and from his people; 5971 there remained 7604-8 not one. 259
8:32 And Pharaoh 6547 hardened 3513-55 his heart 3820 at this time 6471 also, neither would he let the people 5971 go. 7971-14
9:1 Then the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Go in 935-3 unto Pharaoh, 6547 and tell 1696-14 him, Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 God 430 of the Hebrews, 5680 Let my people 5971 go, 7971-16 that they may serve 5647-4 me.
9:2 For if thou refuse 3986 to let [them] go, 7971-15 and wilt hold 2388-56 them still,
9:3 Behold, the hand 3027 of the LORD 3068 is 1961-6 upon thy cattle 4735 which [is] in the field, 7704 upon the horses, 5483 upon the asses, 2543 upon the camels, 1581 upon the oxen, 1241 and upon the sheep: 6629 [there shall be] a very 3966 grievous 3515 murrain. 1698
9:4 And the LORD 3068 shall sever 6395-52 between the cattle 4735 of Israel 3478 and the cattle 4735 of Egypt: 4714 and there shall nothing 1697 die 4191-4 of all [that is] the children's 1121 of Israel. 3478
9:5 And the LORD 3068 appointed 7760-4 a set time, 4150 saying, 559-2 To morrow 4279 the LORD 3068 shall do 6213-4 this thing 1697 in the land. 776
9:6 And the LORD 3068 did 6213-4 that thing 1697 on the morrow, 4283 and all the cattle 4735 of Egypt 4714 died: 4191-4 but of the cattle 4735 of the children 1121 of Israel 3478 died 4191-1 not one. 259
9:7 And Pharaoh 6547 sent, 7971-4 and, behold, there was not one 259 of the cattle 4735 of the Israelites 3478 dead. 4191-1 And the heart 3820 of Pharaoh 6547 was hardened, 3513-4 and he did not let the people 5971 go. 7971-14
9:8 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses 4872 and unto Aaron, 175 Take 3947-3 to you handfuls 2651 4393 of ashes 6368 of the furnace, 3536 and let Moses 4872 sprinkle 2236-1 it toward the heaven 8064 in the sight 5869 of Pharaoh. 6547
9:9 And it shall become small dust 80 in all the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 and shall be a boil 7822 breaking forth 6524-6 [with] blains 76 upon man, 120 and upon beast, 929 throughout all the land 776 of Egypt. 4714
9:10 And they took 3947-4 ashes 6368 of the furnace, 3536 and stood 5975-4 before 6440 Pharaoh; 6547 and Moses 4872 sprinkled 2236-4 it up toward heaven; 8064 and it became a boil 7822 breaking forth 6524-6 [with] blains 76 upon man, 120 and upon beast. 929
9:11 And the magicians 2748 could 3201-1 not stand 5975-2 before 6440 Moses 4872 because 6440 of the boils; 7822 for the boil 7822 was upon the magicians, 2748 and upon all the Egyptians. 4714
9:12 And the LORD 3068 hardened 2388-17 the heart 3820 of Pharaoh, 6547 and he hearkened 8085-1 not unto them; as the LORD 3068 had spoken 1696-14 unto Moses. 4872
9:13 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Rise up early 7925-54 in the morning, 1242 and stand 3320-100 before 6440 Pharaoh, 6547 and say 559-1 unto him, Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 God 430 of the Hebrews, 5680 Let my people 5971 go, 7971-16 that they may serve 5647-4 me.
9:14 For I will at this time 6471 send 7971-6 all my plagues 4046 upon thine heart, 3820 and upon thy servants, 5650 and upon thy people; 5971 that thou mayest know 3045-4 that [there is] none like me in all the earth. 776
9:15 For now I will stretch out 7971-1 my hand, 3027 that I may smite 5221-55 thee and thy people 5971 with pestilence; 1698 and thou shalt be cut off 3582-11 from the earth. 776
9:16 And in very deed 199 for this [cause] have I raised thee up, 5975-52 for 5668 to shew 7200-53 [in] thee my power; 3581 and that my name 8034 may be declared 5608-15 throughout all the earth. 776
9:17 As yet exaltest 5549-109 thou thyself against my people, 5971 that thou wilt not let them go? 7971-15
9:18 Behold, to morrow 4279 about this time 6256 I will cause it to rain 4305-56 a very 3966 grievous 3515 hail, 1259 such as 3644 hath not been in Egypt 4714 since 4480 the foundation 3117 3245-9 thereof even until now.
9:19 Send 7971-3 therefore now, [and] gather 5756-54 thy cattle, 4735 and all that thou hast in the field; 7704 [for upon] every man 120 and beast 929 which shall be found 4672-11 in the field, 7704 and shall not be brought 622-11 home, 1004 the hail 1259 shall come down 3381-1 upon them, and they shall die. 4191-1
9:20 He that feared 3373 the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 among the servants 5650 of Pharaoh 6547 made his servants 5650 and his cattle 4735 flee 5127-52 into the houses: 1004
9:21 And he that regarded 7760-1 3820 not the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 left 5800-4 his servants 5650 and his cattle 4735 in the field. 7704
9:22 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Stretch forth 5186-3 thine hand 3027 toward heaven, 8064 that there may be hail 1259 in all the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 upon man, 120 and upon beast, 929 and upon every herb 6212 of the field, 7704 throughout the land 776 of Egypt. 4714
9:23 And Moses 4872 stretched forth 5186-4 his rod 4294 toward heaven: 8064 and the LORD 3068 sent 5414-1 thunder 6963 and hail, 1259 and the fire 784 ran along 1980-4 upon the ground; 776 and the LORD 3068 rained 4305-55 hail 1259 upon the land 776 of Egypt. 4714
9:24 So there was hail, 1259 and fire 784 mingled 3947-102 with 8432 the hail, 1259 very 3966 grievous, 3515 such as there was none 3808 like it in all the land 776 of Egypt 4714 since it became a nation. 1471
9:25 And the hail 1259 smote 5221-55 throughout all the land 776 of Egypt 4714 all that [was] in the field, 7704 both man 120 and beast; 929 and the hail 1259 smote 5221-52 every herb 6212 of the field, 7704 and brake 7665-14 every tree 6086 of the field. 7704
9:26 Only in the land 776 of Goshen, 1657 where the children 1121 of Israel 3478 [were], was there no hail. 1259
9:27 And Pharaoh 6547 sent, 7971-4 and called 7121-4 for Moses 4872 and Aaron, 175 and said 559-4 unto them, I have sinned 2398-1 this time: 6471 the LORD 3068 [is] righteous, 6662 and I and my people 5971 [are] wicked. 7563
9:28 Intreat 6279-54 the LORD 3068 (for [it is] enough) 7227 that there be no [more] mighty 430 thunderings 6963 and hail; 1259 and I will let you go, 7971-17 and ye shall stay 5975-2 no longer. 3254-55
9:29 And Moses 4872 said 559-4 unto him, As soon as I am gone out 3318-2 of the city, 5892 I will spread abroad 6566-4 my hands 3709 unto the LORD; 3068 [and] the thunder 6963 shall cease, 2308-4 neither shall there be any more hail; 1259 that thou mayest know 3045-4 how that the earth 776 [is] the LORD'S. 3068
9:30 But as for thee and thy servants, 5650 I know 3045-1 that ye will not yet fear 3372-4 6440 the LORD 3068 God. 430
9:31 And the flax 6594 and the barley 8184 was smitten: 5221-27 for the barley 8184 [was] in the ear, 24 and the flax 6594 [was] bolled. 1392
9:32 But the wheat 2406 and the rie 3698 were not smitten: 5221-27 for they 2007 [were] not grown up. 648
9:33 And Moses 4872 went out 3318-4 of the city 5892 from Pharaoh, 6547 and spread abroad 6566-4 his hands 3709 unto the LORD: 3068 and the thunders 6963 and hail 1259 ceased, 2308-4 and the rain 4306 was not poured 5413-8 upon the earth. 776
9:34 And when Pharaoh 6547 saw 7200-4 that the rain 4306 and the hail 1259 and the thunders 6963 were ceased, 2308-1 he sinned 2398-2 yet more, 3254-55 and hardened 3513-55 his heart, 3820 he and his servants. 5650
9:35 And the heart 3820 of Pharaoh 6547 was hardened, 2388-4 neither would he let the children 1121 of Israel 3478 go; 7971-14 as the LORD 3068 had spoken 1696-14 by 3027 Moses. 4872
10:1 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Go in 935-3 unto Pharaoh: 6547 for I have hardened 3513-52 his heart, 3820 and the heart 3820 of his servants, 5650 that I might shew 7896-2 these my signs 226 before 7130 him:
10:2 And that thou mayest tell 5608-17 in the ears 241 of thy son, 1121 and of thy son's 1121 son, 1121 what things I have wrought 5953-98 in Egypt, 4714 and my signs 226 which I have done 7760-1 among them; that ye may know 3045-1 how that I [am] the LORD. 3068
10:3 And Moses 4872 and Aaron 175 came in 935-4 unto Pharaoh, 6547 and said 559-4 unto him, Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 God 430 of the Hebrews, 5680 How long 4970 wilt thou refuse 3985-14 to humble 6031-9 thyself before 6440 me? let my people 5971 go, 7971-16 that they may serve 5647-4 me.
10:4 Else, 3588 if thou refuse 3986 to let my people 5971 go, 7971-15 behold, to morrow 4279 will I bring 935-56 the locusts 697 into thy coast: 1366
10:5 And they shall cover 3680-14 the face 5869 of the earth, 776 that one cannot be able 3201-4 to see 7200-2 the earth: 776 and they shall eat 398-1 the residue 3499 of that which is escaped, 6413 which remaineth 7604-12 unto you from the hail, 1259 and shall eat 398-1 every tree 6086 which groweth 6779-6 for you out of the field: 7704
10:6 And they shall fill 4390-1 thy houses, 1004 and the houses 1004 of all thy servants, 5650 and the houses 1004 of all the Egyptians; 4714 which neither thy fathers, 1 nor thy fathers' 1 fathers 1 have seen, 7200-1 since the day 3117 that they were upon the earth 127 unto this day. 3117 And he turned 6437-4 himself, and went out 3318-4 from Pharaoh. 6547
10:7 And Pharaoh's 6547 servants 5650 said 559-4 unto him, How long shall this man be a snare 4170 unto us? let the men 582 go, 7971-16 that they may serve 5647-4 the LORD 3068 their God: 430 knowest 3045-4 thou not yet 2962 that Egypt 4714 is destroyed? 6-1
10:8 And Moses 4872 and Aaron 175 were brought again 7725-93 unto Pharaoh: 6547 and he said 559-4 unto them, Go, 3212-3 serve 5647-3 the LORD 3068 your God: 430 [but] who [are] they that shall go? 1980-6
10:9 And Moses 4872 said, 559-4 We will go 3212-4 with our young 5288 and with our old, 2205 with our sons 1121 and with our daughters, 1323 with our flocks 6629 and with our herds 1241 will we go; 3212-4 for we [must hold] a feast 2282 unto the LORD. 3068
10:10 And he said 559-4 unto them, Let the LORD 3068 be so with you, as I will let you go, 7971-17 and your little ones: 2945 look 7200-3 [to it]; for evil 7451 [is] before 6440 you.
10:11 Not so: go 3212-3 now ye [that are] men, 1397 and serve 5647-3 the LORD; 3068 for that ye did desire. 1245-18 And they were driven out 1644-17 from Pharaoh's 6547 presence. 6440
10:12 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Stretch out 5186-3 thine hand 3027 over the land 776 of Egypt 4714 for the locusts, 697 that they may come up 5927-4 upon the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 and eat 398-4 every herb 6212 of the land, 776 [even] all that the hail 1259 hath left. 7604-52
10:13 And Moses 4872 stretched forth 5186-4 his rod 4294 over the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 and the LORD 3068 brought 5090-14 an east 6921 wind 7307 upon the land 776 all that day, 3117 and all [that] night; 3915 [and] when it was morning, 1242 the east 6921 wind 7307 brought 5375-1 the locusts. 697
10:14 And the locusts 697 went up 5927-4 over all the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 and rested 5117-4 in all the coasts 1366 of Egypt: 4714 very 3966 grievous 3515 [were they]; before 6440 them there were no such 3651 locusts 697 as they, neither after 310 them shall be such.
10:15 For they covered 3680-17 the face 5869 of the whole earth, 776 so that the land 776 was darkened; 2821-4 and they did eat 398-4 every herb 6212 of the land, 776 and all the fruit 6529 of the trees 6086 which the hail 1259 had left: 3498-52 and there remained 3498-8 not any green thing 3418 in the trees, 6086 or in the herbs 6212 of the field, 7704 through all the land 776 of Egypt. 4714
10:16 Then Pharaoh 6547 called 7121-2 for Moses 4872 and Aaron 175 in haste; 4116-17 and he said, 559-4 I have sinned 2398-1 against the LORD 3068 your God, 430 and against you.
10:17 Now therefore forgive, 5375-3 I pray thee, my sin 2403 only this once, 6471 and intreat 6279-54 the LORD 3068 your God, 430 that he may take away 5493-55 from me this death 4194 only.
10:18 And he went out 3318-4 from Pharaoh, 6547 and intreated 6279-4 the LORD. 3068
10:19 And the LORD 3068 turned 2015-4 a mighty 3966 strong 2389 west 3220 wind, 7307 which took away 5375-4 the locusts, 697 and cast 8628-4 them into the Red 5488 sea; 3220 there remained 7604-8 not one 259 locust 697 in all the coasts 1366 of Egypt. 4714
10:20 But the LORD 3068 hardened 2388-17 Pharaoh's 6547 heart, 3820 so that he would not let the children 1121 of Israel 3478 go. 7971-14
10:21 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Stretch out 5186-3 thine hand 3027 toward heaven, 8064 that there may be darkness 2822 over the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 even darkness 2822 [which] may be felt. 4959-55
10:22 And Moses 4872 stretched forth 5186-4 his hand 3027 toward heaven; 8064 and there was a thick 653 darkness 2822 in all the land 776 of Egypt 4714 three 7969 days: 3117
10:23 They saw 7200-1 not one 376 another, 251 neither rose 6965-1 any 376 from his place for three 7969 days: 3117 but all the children 1121 of Israel 3478 had light 216 in their dwellings. 4186
10:24 And Pharaoh 6547 called 7121-4 unto Moses, 4872 and said, 559-4 Go 3212-3 ye, serve 5647-3 the LORD; 3068 only let your flocks 6629 and your herds 1241 be stayed: 3322-93 let your little ones 2945 also go 3212-4 with you.
10:25 And Moses 4872 said, 559-4 Thou must give 5414-4 us 3027 also sacrifices 2077 and burnt offerings, 5930 that we may sacrifice 6213-1 unto the LORD 3068 our God. 430
10:26 Our cattle 4735 also shall go 3212-4 with us; there shall not an hoof 6541 be left 7604-11 behind; for thereof must we take 3947-4 to serve 5647-2 the LORD 3068 our God; 430 and we know 3045-4 not with what we must serve 5647-4 the LORD, 3068 until we come 935-2 thither.
10:27 But the LORD 3068 hardened 2388-17 Pharaoh's 6547 heart, 3820 and he would 14-1 not let them go. 7971-15
10:28 And Pharaoh 6547 said 559-4 unto him, Get 3212-3 thee from me, take heed 8104-10 to thyself, see 7200-2 my face 6440 no more; 3254-55 for in [that] day 3117 thou seest 7200-2 my face 6440 thou shalt die. 4191-4
10:29 And Moses 4872 said, 559-4 Thou hast spoken 1696-14 well, 3651 I will see 7200-2 thy face 6440 again 3254-55 no more.
11:1 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Yet will I bring 935-55 one 259 plague 5061 [more] upon Pharaoh, 6547 and upon Egypt; 4714 afterwards 310 he will let you go 7971-17 hence: when he shall let [you] go, 7971-15 he shall surely 1644-15 thrust you out 1644-17 hence altogether. 3617
11:2 Speak 1696-16 now in the ears 241 of the people, 5971 and let every man 376 borrow 7592-4 of his neighbour, 7453 and every woman 802 of her neighbour, 7468 jewels 3627 of silver, 3701 and jewels 3627 of gold. 2091
11:3 And the LORD 3068 gave 5414-4 the people 5971 favour 2580 in the sight 5869 of the Egyptians. 4714 Moreover the man 376 Moses 4872 [was] very 3966 great 1419 in the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 in the sight 5869 of Pharaoh's 6547 servants, 5650 and in the sight 5869 of the people. 5971
11:4 And Moses 4872 said, 559-4 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 About midnight 3915 2676 will I go out 3318-6 into the midst 8432 of Egypt: 4714
11:5 And all the firstborn 1060 in the land 776 of Egypt 4714 shall die, 4191-1 from the firstborn 1060 of Pharaoh 6547 that sitteth 3427-6 upon his throne, 3678 even unto the firstborn 1060 of the maidservant 8198 that [is] behind 310 the mill; 7347 and all the firstborn 1060 of beasts. 929
11:6 And there shall be a great 1419 cry 6818 throughout all the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 such as there was 1961-8 none 3808 like it, nor 3808 shall be like it any more. 3254-55
11:7 But against any of the children 1121 of Israel 3478 shall not a dog 3611 move 2782-4 his tongue, 3956 against man 376 or beast: 929 that ye may know 3045-4 how that the LORD 3068 doth put a difference 6395-55 between the Egyptians 4714 and Israel. 3478
11:8 And all these thy servants 5650 shall come down 3381-1 unto me, and bow down 7812-98 themselves unto me, saying, 559-2 Get thee out, 3318-3 and all the people 5971 that follow 7272 thee: and after 310 that I will go out. 3318-4 And he went out 3318-4 from Pharaoh 6547 in a great 2750 anger. 639
11:9 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Pharaoh 6547 shall not hearken 8085-4 unto you; that my wonders 4159 may be multiplied 7235-2 in the land 776 of Egypt. 4714
11:10 And Moses 4872 and Aaron 175 did 6213-1 all these wonders 4159 before 6440 Pharaoh: 6547 and the LORD 3068 hardened 2388-17 Pharaoh's 6547 heart, 3820 so that he would not let the children 1121 of Israel 3478 go 7971-14 out of his land. 776
12:1 And the LORD 3068 spake 559-4 unto Moses 4872 and Aaron 175 in the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 saying, 559-2
12:2 This month 2320 [shall be] unto you the beginning 7218 of months: 2320 it [shall be] the first 7223 month 2320 of the year 8141 to you.
12:3 Speak 1696-16 ye unto all the congregation 5712 of Israel, 3478 saying, 559-2 In the tenth 6218 [day] of this month 2320 they shall take 3947-4 to them every man 376 a lamb, 7716 according to the house 1004 of [their] fathers, 1 a lamb 7716 for an house: 1004
12:4 And if the household 1004 be too little 4591-4 1961-2 for the lamb, 7716 let him and his neighbour 7934 next 7138 unto his house 1004 take 3947-1 [it] according to the number 4373 of the souls; 5315 every man 376 according 6310 to his eating 400 shall make your count 3699-4 for the lamb. 7716
12:5 Your lamb 7716 shall be without blemish, 8549 a male 2145 of the first 1121 year: 8141 ye shall take 3947-4 [it] out from the sheep, 3532 or from the goats: 5795
12:6 And ye shall keep 4931 it up until the fourteenth 702 6240 day 3117 of the same month: 2320 and the whole 3605 assembly 6951 of the congregation 5712 of Israel 3478 shall kill 7819-1 it in 996 the evening. 6153
12:7 And they shall take 3947-1 of the blood, 1818 and strike 5414-1 [it] on the two 8147 side posts 4201 and on the upper door post 4947 of the houses, 1004 wherein they shall eat 398-4 it.
12:8 And they shall eat 398-1 the flesh 1320 in that night, 3915 roast 6748 with fire, 784 and unleavened bread; 4682 [and] with bitter 4844 [herbs] they shall eat 398-4 it.
12:9 Eat 398-4 not of it raw, 4995 nor sodden 1310-30 1311 at all with water, 4325 but roast 6748 [with] fire; 784 his head 7218 with his legs, 3767 and with the purtenance 7130 thereof.
12:10 And ye shall let nothing of it remain 3498-55 until the morning; 1242 and that which remaineth 3498-12 of it until the morning 1242 ye shall burn 8313-4 with fire. 784
12:11 And thus 3602 shall ye eat 398-4 it; [with] your loins 4975 girded, 2296-7 your shoes 5275 on your feet, 7272 and your staff 4731 in your hand; 3027 and ye shall eat 398-1 it in haste: 2649 it [is] the LORD'S 3068 passover. 6453
12:12 For I will pass 5674-1 through the land 776 of Egypt 4714 this night, 3915 and will smite 5221-52 all the firstborn 1060 in the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 both man 120 and beast; 929 and against all the gods 430 of Egypt 4714 I will execute 6213-4 judgment: 8201 I [am] the LORD. 3068
12:13 And the blood 1818 shall be to you for a token 226 upon the houses 1004 where ye [are]: and when I see 7200-1 the blood, 1818 I will pass 6452-1 over you, and the plague 5063 shall not be upon you to destroy 4889 [you], when I smite 5221-53 the land 776 of Egypt. 4714
12:14 And this day 3117 shall be unto you for a memorial; 2146 and ye shall keep 2287-1 it a feast 2282 to the LORD 3068 throughout your generations; 1755 ye shall keep it a feast 2287-4 by an ordinance 2708 for ever. 5769
12:15 Seven 7651 days 3117 shall ye eat 398-4 unleavened bread; 4682 even 389 the first 7223 day 3117 ye shall put away 7673-55 leaven 7603 out of your houses: 1004 for whosoever eateth 398-6 leavened bread 2557 from the first 7223 day 3117 until the seventh 7637 day, 3117 that soul 5315 shall be cut off 3772-8 from Israel. 3478
12:16 And in the first 7223 day 3117 [there shall be] an holy 6944 convocation, 4744 and in the seventh 7637 day 3117 there shall be an holy 6944 convocation 4744 to you; no manner of work 4399 shall be done 6213-11 in them, save 389 [that] which every man 5315 must eat, 398-11 that only may be done 6213-11 of you.
12:17 And ye shall observe 8104-1 [the feast of] unleavened bread; 4682 for in this selfsame 6106 day 3117 have I brought your armies 6635 out 3318-52 of the land 776 of Egypt: 4714 therefore shall ye observe 8104-1 this day 3117 in your generations 1755 by an ordinance 2708 for ever. 5769
12:18 In the first 7223 [month], on the fourteenth 6240 702 day 3117 of the month 2320 at even, 6153 ye shall eat 398-4 unleavened bread, 4682 until the one 259 and twentieth 6242 day 3117 of the month 2320 at even. 6153
12:19 Seven 7651 days 3117 shall there be no leaven 7603 found 4672-11 in your houses: 1004 for whosoever eateth 398-6 that which is leavened, 2556-56 even that soul 5315 shall be cut off 3772-8 from the congregation 5712 of Israel, 3478 whether he be a stranger, 1616 or born 249 in the land. 776
12:20 Ye shall eat 398-4 nothing leavened; 2556-56 in all your habitations 4186 shall ye eat 398-4 unleavened bread. 4682
12:21 Then Moses 4872 called 7121-4 for all the elders 2205 of Israel, 3478 and said 559-4 unto them, Draw out 4900-3 and take 3947-3 you a lamb 6629 according to your families, 4940 and kill 7819-3 the passover. 6453
12:22 And ye shall take 3947-1 a bunch 92 of hyssop, 231 and dip 2881-1 [it] in the blood 1818 that [is] in the bason, 5592 and strike 5060-52 the lintel 4947 and the two 8147 side posts 4201 with the blood 1818 that [is] in the bason; 5592 and none 376 of you shall go out 3318-4 at the door 6607 of his house 1004 until the morning. 1242
12:23 For the LORD 3068 will pass through 5674-1 to smite 5062-2 the Egyptians; 4714 and when he seeth 7200-1 the blood 1818 upon the lintel, 4947 and on the two 8147 side posts, 4201 the LORD 3068 will pass 6452-1 over the door, 6607 and will not suffer 5414-4 the destroyer 7843-56 to come 935-2 in unto your houses 1004 to smite 5062-2 [you].
12:24 And ye shall observe 8104-1 this thing 1697 for an ordinance 2706 to thee and to thy sons 1121 for 5704 ever. 5769
12:25 And it shall come to pass, when ye be come 935-4 to the land 776 which the LORD 3068 will give 5414-4 you, according as he hath promised, 1696-14 that ye shall keep 8104-1 this service. 5656
12:26 And it shall come to pass, when your children 1121 shall say 559-4 unto you, What mean ye by this service? 5656
12:27 That ye shall say, 559-1 It [is] the sacrifice 2077 of the LORD'S 3068 passover, 6453 who passed 6452-1 over the houses 1004 of the children 1121 of Israel 3478 in Egypt, 4714 when he smote 5062-2 the Egyptians, 4714 and delivered 5337-52 our houses. 1004 And the people 5971 bowed the head 6915-4 and worshipped. 7812-101
12:28 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 went away, 3212-4 and did 6213-4 as the LORD 3068 had commanded 6680-14 Moses 4872 and Aaron, 175 so did 6213-1 they.
12:29 And it came to pass, that at midnight 2677 3915 the LORD 3068 smote 5221-52 all the firstborn 1060 in the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 from the firstborn 1060 of Pharaoh 6547 that sat 3427-6 on his throne 3678 unto the firstborn 1060 of the captive 7628 that [was] in the dungeon; 1004 953 and all the firstborn 1060 of cattle. 929
12:30 And Pharaoh 6547 rose up 6965-4 in the night, 3915 he, and all his servants, 5650 and all the Egyptians; 4714 and there was a great 1419 cry 6818 in Egypt; 4714 for [there was] not a house 1004 where [there was] not one dead. 4191-5
12:31 And he called 7121-4 for Moses 4872 and Aaron 175 by night, 3915 and said, 559-4 Rise up, 6965-3 [and] get you forth 3318-3 from among 8432 my people, 5971 both ye and the children 1121 of Israel; 3478 and go, 3212-3 serve 5647-3 the LORD, 3068 as ye have said. 1696-15
12:32 Also take 3947-3 your flocks 6629 and your herds, 1241 as ye have said, 1696-14 and be gone; 3212-3 and bless 1288-14 me also.
12:33 And the Egyptians 4714 were urgent 2388-4 upon the people, 5971 that they might send 7971-15 them out of the land 776 in haste; 4116-15 for they said, 559-1 We [be] all dead 4191-5 [men].
12:34 And the people 5971 took 5375-4 their dough 1217 before it was leavened, 2556-4 their kneadingtroughs 4863 being bound up 6887-7 in their clothes 8071 upon their shoulders. 7926
12:35 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 did 6213-1 according to the word 1697 of Moses; 4872 and they borrowed 7592-4 of the Egyptians 4714 jewels 3627 of silver, 3701 and jewels 3627 of gold, 2091 and raiment: 8071
12:36 And the LORD 3068 gave 5414-1 the people 5971 favour 2580 in the sight 5869 of the Egyptians, 4714 so that they lent 7592-55 unto them [such things as they required]. And they spoiled 5337-17 the Egyptians. 4714
12:37 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 journeyed 5265-4 from Rameses 7486 to Succoth, 5523 about six 8337 hundred 3967 thousand 505 on foot 7273 [that were] men, 1397 beside 905 children. 2945
12:38 And a mixed 6154 multitude 7227 went up 5927-1 also with them; and flocks, 6629 and herds, 1241 [even] very 3966 much 3515 cattle. 4735
12:39 And they baked 644-4 unleavened 4682 cakes 5692 of the dough 1217 which they brought forth 3318-52 out of Egypt, 4714 for it was not leavened; 2556-1 because they were thrust out 1644-27 of Egypt, 4714 and could 3201-1 not tarry, 4102-116 neither had they prepared 6213-1 for themselves any victual. 6720
12:40 Now the sojourning 4186 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 who dwelt 3427-1 in Egypt, 4714 [was] four 702 hundred 3967 8141 and thirty 7970 years. 8141
12:41 And it came to pass at the end 7093 of the four 702 hundred 3967 8141 and thirty 7970 years, 8141 even the selfsame 6106 day 3117 it came to pass, that all the hosts 6635 of the LORD 3068 went out 3318-1 from the land 776 of Egypt. 4714
12:42 It [is] a night 3915 to be much observed 8107 unto the LORD 3068 for bringing them out 3318-53 from the land 776 of Egypt: 4714 this [is] that night 3915 of the LORD 3068 to be observed 8107 of all the children 1121 of Israel 3478 in their generations. 1755
12:43 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses 4872 and Aaron, 175 This [is] the ordinance 2708 of the passover: 6453 There shall no stranger 1121 5236 eat 398-4 thereof:
12:44 But every man's 376 servant 5650 that is bought 4736 for money, 3701 when thou hast circumcised 4135-1 him, then shall he eat 398-4 thereof.
12:45 A foreigner 8453 and an hired servant 7916 shall not eat 398-4 thereof.
12:46 In one 259 house 1004 shall it be eaten; 398-11 thou shalt not carry forth 3318-55 ought of the flesh 1320 abroad 2351 out of the house; 1004 neither shall ye break 7665-4 a bone 6106 thereof.
12:47 All the congregation 5712 of Israel 3478 shall keep 6213-4 it.
12:48 And when a stranger 1616 shall sojourn 1481-4 with thee, and will keep 6213-1 the passover 6453 to the LORD, 3068 let all his males 2145 be circumcised, 4135-9 and then let him come near 7126-4 and keep 6213-2 it; and he shall be as one that is born 249 in the land: 776 for no uncircumcised 6189 person shall eat 398-4 thereof.
12:49 One 259 law 8451 shall be to him that is homeborn, 249 and unto the stranger 1616 that sojourneth 1481-6 among 8432 you.
12:50 Thus did 6213-4 all the children 1121 of Israel; 3478 as the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses 4872 and Aaron, 175 so did 6213-1 they.
12:51 And it came to pass the selfsame 6106 day, 3117 [that] the LORD 3068 did bring the children 1121 of Israel 3478 out 3318-52 of the land 776 of Egypt 4714 by their armies. 6635
13:1 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2
13:2 Sanctify 6942-16 unto me all the firstborn, 1060 whatsoever openeth 6363 the womb 7358 among the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 [both] of man 120 and of beast: 929 it [is] mine.
13:3 And Moses 4872 said 559-4 unto the people, 5971 Remember 2142-2 this day, 3117 in which ye came out 3318-1 from Egypt, 4714 out of the house 1004 of bondage; 5650 for by strength 2392 of hand 3027 the LORD 3068 brought you out 3318-52 from this 2088 [place]: there shall no leavened bread 2557 be eaten. 398-11
13:4 This day 3117 came ye out 3318-6 in the month 2320 Abib. 24
13:5 And it shall be when the LORD 3068 shall bring 935-55 thee into the land 776 of the Canaanites, 3669 and the Hittites, 2850 and the Amorites, 567 and the Hivites, 2340 and the Jebusites, 2983 which he sware 7650-8 unto thy fathers 1 to give 5414-2 thee, a land 776 flowing 2100-6 with milk 2461 and honey, 1706 that thou shalt keep 5647-1 this service 5656 in this month. 2320
13:6 Seven 7651 days 3117 thou shalt eat 398-4 unleavened bread, 4682 and in the seventh 7637 day 3117 [shall be] a feast 2282 to the LORD. 3068
13:7 Unleavened bread 4682 shall be eaten 398-11 seven 7651 days; 3117 and there shall no leavened bread 2557 be seen 7200-11 with thee, neither shall there be leaven 7603 seen 7200-11 with thee in all thy quarters. 1366
13:8 And thou shalt shew 5046-52 thy son 1121 in that day, 3117 saying, 559-2 [This is done] because of 5668 that 2088 [which] the LORD 3068 did 6213-1 unto me when I came forth 3318-2 out of Egypt. 4714
13:9 And it shall be for a sign 226 unto thee upon thine hand, 3027 and for a memorial 2146 between thine eyes, 5869 that the LORD'S 3068 law 8451 may be in thy mouth: 6310 for with a strong 2389 hand 3027 hath the LORD 3068 brought thee out 3318-52 of Egypt. 4714
13:10 Thou shalt therefore keep 8104-1 this ordinance 2708 in his season 4150 from year 3117 to year. 3117
13:11 And it shall be when the LORD 3068 shall bring 935-55 thee into the land 776 of the Canaanites, 3669 as he sware 7650-8 unto thee and to thy fathers, 1 and shall give 5414-1 it thee,
13:12 That thou shalt set apart 5674-52 unto the LORD 3068 all that openeth 6363 the matrix, 7358 and every firstling 6363 that cometh 7698 of a beast 929 which thou hast; the males 2145 [shall be] the LORD'S. 3068
13:13 And every firstling 6363 of an ass 2543 thou shalt redeem 6299-4 with a lamb; 7716 and if thou wilt not redeem 6299-4 it, then thou shalt break his neck: 6202-1 and all the firstborn 1060 of man 120 among thy children 1121 shalt thou redeem. 6299-4
13:14 And it shall be when thy son 1121 asketh 7592-4 thee in time to come, 4279 saying, 559-2 What [is] this? that thou shalt say 559-1 unto him, By strength 2392 of hand 3027 the LORD 3068 brought us out 3318-52 from Egypt, 4714 from the house 1004 of bondage: 5650
13:15 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh 6547 would hardly 7185-52 let us go, 7971-15 that the LORD 3068 slew 2026-4 all the firstborn 1060 in the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 both the firstborn 1060 of man, 120 and the firstborn 1060 of beast: 929 therefore I sacrifice 2076-6 to the LORD 3068 all that openeth 6363 the matrix, 7358 being males; 2145 but all the firstborn 1060 of my children 1121 I redeem. 6299-4
13:16 And it shall be for a token 226 upon thine hand, 3027 and for frontlets 2903 between thine eyes: 5869 for by strength 2392 of hand 3027 the LORD 3068 brought us forth 3318-52 out of Egypt. 4714
13:17 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh 6547 had let the people 5971 go, 7971-15 that God 430 led 5148-1 them not [through] the way 1870 of the land 776 of the Philistines, 6430 although 3588 that [was] near; 7138 for 3588 God 430 said, 559-1 Lest peradventure the people 5971 repent 5162-11 when they see 7200-2 war, 4421 and they return 7725-1 to Egypt: 4714
13:18 But God 430 led the people 5971 about, 5437-55 [through] the way 1870 of the wilderness 4057 of the Red 5488 sea: 3220 and the children 1121 of Israel 3478 went up 5927-1 harnessed 2571 out of the land 776 of Egypt. 4714
13:19 And Moses 4872 took 3947-4 the bones 6106 of Joseph 3130 with him: for he had straitly 7650-53 sworn 7650-52 the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 saying, 559-2 God 430 will surely 6485-2 visit 6485-4 you; and ye shall carry up 5927-52 my bones 6106 away hence with you.
13:20 And they took their journey 5265-4 from Succoth, 5523 and encamped 2583-4 in Etham, 864 in the edge 7097 of the wilderness. 4057
13:21 And the LORD 3068 went 1980-6 before 6440 them by day 3119 in a pillar 5982 of a cloud, 6051 to lead 5148-53 them the way; 1870 and by night 3915 in a pillar 5982 of fire, 784 to give them light; 215-53 to go 3212-2 by day 3119 and night: 3915
13:22 He took not away 4185-55 the pillar 5982 of the cloud 6051 by day, 3119 nor the pillar 5982 of fire 784 by night, 3915 [from] before 6440 the people. 5971
14:1 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2
14:2 Speak 1696-16 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 that they turn 7725-4 and encamp 2583-4 before 6440 Pihahiroth, 6367 between Migdol 4024 and the sea, 3220 over against 6440 Baalzephon: 1189 before 5226 it shall ye encamp 2583-4 by the sea. 3220
14:3 For Pharaoh 6547 will say 559-1 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 They [are] entangled 943-12 in the land, 776 the wilderness 4057 hath shut 5462-1 them in.
14:4 And I will harden 2388-14 Pharaoh's 6547 heart, 3820 that he shall follow 7291-1 after 310 them; and I will be honoured 3513-11 upon Pharaoh, 6547 and upon all his host; 2428 that the Egyptians 4714 may know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD. 3068 And they did 6213-4 so.
14:5 And it was told 5046-93 the king 4428 of Egypt 4714 that the people 5971 fled: 1272-1 and the heart 3824 of Pharaoh 6547 and of his servants 5650 was turned 2015-11 against the people, 5971 and they said, 559-4 Why have we done 6213-1 this, that we have let Israel 3478 go 7971-14 from serving 5647-2 us?
14:6 And he made ready 631-4 his chariot, 7393 and took 3947-1 his people 5971 with him:
14:7 And he took 3947-4 six 8337 hundred 3967 chosen 977-7 chariots, 7393 and all the chariots 7393 of Egypt, 4714 and captains 7991 over every one of them.
14:8 And the LORD 3068 hardened 2388-17 the heart 3820 of Pharaoh 6547 king 4428 of Egypt, 4714 and he pursued 7291-4 after 310 the children 1121 of Israel: 3478 and the children 1121 of Israel 3478 went out 3318-6 with an high 7311-6 hand. 3027
14:9 But the Egyptians 4714 pursued 7291-4 after 310 them, all the horses 5483 [and] chariots 7393 of Pharaoh, 6547 and his horsemen, 6571 and his army, 2428 and overtook 5381-55 them encamping 2583-6 by the sea, 3220 beside Pihahiroth, 6367 before 6440 Baalzephon. 1189
14:10 And when Pharaoh 6547 drew nigh, 7126-52 the children 1121 of Israel 3478 lifted up 5375-4 their eyes, 5869 and, behold, the Egyptians 4714 marched 5265-6 after 310 them; and they were sore 3966 afraid: 3372-4 and the children 1121 of Israel 3478 cried out 6817-4 unto the LORD. 3068
14:11 And they said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Because [there were] no graves 6913 in Egypt, 4714 hast thou taken us away 3947-1 to die 4191-2 in the wilderness? 4057 wherefore hast thou dealt 6213-1 thus 2063 with us, to carry us forth 3318-53 out of Egypt? 4714
14:12 [Is] not this the word 1697 that we did tell 1696-14 thee in Egypt, 4714 saying, 559-2 Let us alone, 2308-3 that we may serve 5647-4 the Egyptians? 4714 For [it had been] better 2896 for us to serve 5647-2 the Egyptians, 4714 than that we should die 4191-2 in the wilderness. 4057
14:13 And Moses 4872 said 559-4 unto the people, 5971 Fear 3372-4 ye not, stand still, 3320-100 and see 7200-3 the salvation 3444 of the LORD, 3068 which he will shew 6213-4 to you to day: 3117 for the Egyptians 4714 whom ye have seen 7200-1 to day, 3117 ye shall see 7200-2 them again 3254-55 no more for 5704 ever. 5769
14:14 The LORD 3068 shall fight 3898-11 for you, and ye shall hold your peace. 2790-55
14:15 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Wherefore criest 6817-4 thou unto me? speak 1696-16 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 that they go forward: 5265-4
14:16 But lift thou up 7311-54 thy rod, 4294 and stretch out 5186-3 thine hand 3027 over the sea, 3220 and divide 1234-3 it: and the children 1121 of Israel 3478 shall go 935-4 on dry 3004 [ground] through the midst 8432 of the sea. 3220
14:17 And I, behold, I will harden 2388-18 the hearts 3820 of the Egyptians, 4714 and they shall follow 935-4 310 them: and I will get me honour 3513-11 upon Pharaoh, 6547 and upon all his host, 2428 upon his chariots, 7393 and upon his horsemen. 6571
14:18 And the Egyptians 4714 shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD, 3068 when I have gotten me honour 3513-9 upon Pharaoh, 6547 upon his chariots, 7393 and upon his horsemen. 6571
14:19 And the angel 4397 of God, 430 which went 1980-6 before 6440 the camp 4264 of Israel, 3478 removed 5265-4 and went 3212-4 behind 310 them; and the pillar 5982 of the cloud 6051 went 5265-4 from before their face, 6440 and stood 5975-4 behind 310 them:
14:20 And it came 935-4 between the camp 4264 of the Egyptians 4714 and the camp 4264 of Israel; 3478 and it was a cloud 6051 and darkness 2822 [to them], but it gave light 215-55 by night 3915 [to these]: so that the one 2088 came not near 7126-1 the other 2088 all the night. 3915
14:21 And Moses 4872 stretched out 5186-4 his hand 3027 over the sea; 3220 and the LORD 3068 caused the sea 3220 to go 3212-55 [back] by a strong 5794 east 6921 wind 7307 all that night, 3915 and made 7760-4 the sea 3220 dry 2724 [land], and the waters 4325 were divided. 1234-11
14:22 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 went 935-4 into the midst 8432 of the sea 3220 upon the dry 3004 [ground]: and the waters 4325 [were] a wall 2346 unto them on their right hand, 3225 and on their left. 8040
14:23 And the Egyptians 4714 pursued, 7291-4 and went in 935-4 after 310 them to the midst 8432 of the sea, 3220 [even] all Pharaoh's 6547 horses, 5483 his chariots, 7393 and his horsemen. 6571
14:24 And it came to pass, that in the morning 1242 watch 821 the LORD 3068 looked 8259-55 unto the host 4264 of the Egyptians 4714 through the pillar 5982 of fire 784 and of the cloud, 6051 and troubled 2000-4 the host 4264 of the Egyptians, 4714
14:25 And took off 5493-55 their chariot 4818 wheels, 212 that they drave 5090-17 them heavily: 3517 so that the Egyptians 4714 said, 559-4 Let us flee 5127-4 from the face 6440 of Israel; 3478 for the LORD 3068 fighteth 3898-12 for them against the Egyptians. 4714
14:26 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Stretch out 5186-3 thine hand 3027 over the sea, 3220 that the waters 4325 may come again 7725-4 upon the Egyptians, 4714 upon their chariots, 7393 and upon their horsemen. 6571
14:27 And Moses 4872 stretched forth 5186-4 his hand 3027 over the sea, 3220 and the sea 3220 returned 7725-4 to his strength 386 when the morning 1242 appeared; 6437-2 and the Egyptians 4714 fled 5127-5 against 7125-2 it; and the LORD 3068 overthrew 5287-17 the Egyptians 4714 in the midst 8432 of the sea. 3220
14:28 And the waters 4325 returned, 7725-4 and covered 3680-17 the chariots, 7393 and the horsemen, 6571 [and] all the host 2428 of Pharaoh 6547 that came 935-6 into the sea 3220 after 310 them; there remained 7604-8 not so much as 5704 one 259 of them.
14:29 But the children 1121 of Israel 3478 walked 1980-1 upon dry 3004 [land] in the midst 8432 of the sea; 3220 and the waters 4325 [were] a wall 2346 unto them on their right hand, 3225 and on their left. 8040
14:30 Thus the LORD 3068 saved 3467-55 Israel 3478 that day 3117 out of the hand 3027 of the Egyptians; 4714 and Israel 3478 saw 7200-4 the Egyptians 4714 dead 4191-5 upon the sea 3220 shore. 8193
14:31 And Israel 3478 saw 7200-4 that great 1419 work 3027 which the LORD 3068 did 6213-1 upon the Egyptians: 4714 and the people 5971 feared 3372-4 the LORD, 3068 and believed 539-55 the LORD, 3068 and his servant 5650 Moses. 4872
15:1 Then sang 7891-4 Moses 4872 and the children 1121 of Israel 3478 this song 7892 unto the LORD, 3068 and spake, 559-4 saying, 559-2 I will sing 7891-4 unto the LORD, 3068 for he hath triumphed 1342-1 gloriously: 1342-2 the horse 5483 and his rider 7392-6 hath he thrown 7411-1 into the sea. 3220
15:2 The LORD 3050 [is] my strength 5797 and song, 2176 and he is become my salvation: 3444 he 2088 [is] my God, 410 and I will prepare him an habitation; 5115-55 my father's 1 God, 430 and I will exalt 7311-34 him.
15:3 The LORD 3068 [is] a man 376 of war: 4421 the LORD 3068 [is] his name. 8034
15:4 Pharaoh's 6547 chariots 4818 and his host 2428 hath he cast 3384-1 into the sea: 3220 his chosen 4005 captains 7991 also are drowned 2883-27 in the Red 5488 sea. 3220
15:5 The depths 8415 have covered 3680-17 them: they sank 3381-1 into the bottom 4688 as 3644 a stone. 68
15:6 Thy right hand, 3225 O LORD, 3068 is become glorious 142-12 in power: 3581 thy right hand, 3225 O LORD, 3068 hath dashed in pieces 7492-4 the enemy. 341-6
15:7 And in the greatness 7230 of thine excellency 1347 thou hast overthrown 2040-4 them that rose up against 6965-5 thee: thou sentest forth 7971-17 thy wrath, 2740 [which] consumed 398-4 them as stubble. 7179
15:8 And with the blast 7307 of thy nostrils 639 the waters 4325 were gathered together, 6192-8 the floods 5140-6 stood upright 5324-8 as an heap, 5067 [and] the depths 8415 were congealed 7087-1 in the heart 3820 of the sea. 3220
15:9 The enemy 341-6 said, 559-1 I will pursue, 7291-4 I will overtake, 5381-55 I will divide 2505-17 the spoil; 7998 my lust 5315 shall be satisfied 4390-4 upon them; I will draw 7324-55 my sword, 2719 my hand 3027 shall destroy 3423-55 them.
15:10 Thou didst blow 5398-1 with thy wind, 7307 the sea 3220 covered 3680-14 them: they sank 6749-1 as lead 5777 in the mighty 117 waters. 4325
15:11 Who [is] like unto thee, O LORD, 3068 among the gods? 410 who [is] like thee, glorious 142-12 in holiness, 6944 fearful 3372-12 [in] praises, 8416 doing 6213-6 wonders? 6382
15:12 Thou stretchedst out 5186-1 thy right hand, 3225 the earth 776 swallowed 1104-4 them.
15:13 Thou in thy mercy 2617 hast led forth 5148-1 the people 5971 [which] 2098 thou hast redeemed: 1350-1 thou hast guided 5095-14 [them] in thy strength 5797 unto thy holy 6944 habitation. 5116
15:14 The people 5971 shall hear, 8085-1 [and] be afraid: 7264-4 sorrow 2427 shall take hold 270-1 on the inhabitants 3427-6 of Palestina. 6429
15:15 Then 227 the dukes 441 of Edom 123 shall be amazed; 926-8 the mighty men 352 of Moab, 4124 trembling 7461 shall take hold upon them; 270-4 all the inhabitants 3427-6 of Canaan 3667 shall melt away. 4127-8
15:16 Fear 367 and dread 6343 shall fall 5307-4 upon them; by the greatness 1419 of thine arm 2220 they shall be [as] still 1826-4 as a stone; 68 till thy people 5971 pass over, 5674-4 O LORD, 3068 till the people 5971 pass over, 5674-4 [which] 2098 thou hast purchased. 7069-1
15:17 Thou shalt bring them in, 935-55 and plant 5193-4 them in the mountain 2022 of thine inheritance, 5159 [in] the place, 4349 O LORD, 3068 [which] thou hast made 6466-1 for thee to dwell in, 3427-2 [in] the Sanctuary, 4720 O Lord, 136 [which] thy hands 3027 have established. 3559-31
15:18 The LORD 3068 shall reign 4427-4 for ever 5769 and ever. 5703
15:19 For the horse 5483 of Pharaoh 6547 went in 935-1 with his chariots 7393 and with his horsemen 6571 into the sea, 3220 and the LORD 3068 brought again 7725-55 the waters 4325 of the sea 3220 upon them; but the children 1121 of Israel 3478 went 1980-1 on dry 3004 [land] in the midst 8432 of the sea. 3220
15:20 And Miriam 4813 the prophetess, 5031 the sister 269 of Aaron, 175 took 3947-4 a timbrel 8596 in her hand; 3027 and all the women 802 went out 3318-4 after 310 her with timbrels 8596 and with dances. 4246
15:21 And Miriam 4813 answered 6030-4 them, Sing 7891-3 ye to the LORD, 3068 for he hath triumphed 1342-1 gloriously; 1342-2 the horse 5483 and his rider 7392-6 hath he thrown 7411-1 into the sea. 3220
15:22 So Moses 4872 brought 5265-55 Israel 3478 from the Red 5488 sea, 3220 and they went out 3318-4 into the wilderness 4057 of Shur; 7793 and they went 3212-4 three 7969 days 3117 in the wilderness, 4057 and found 4672-1 no water. 4325
15:23 And when they came 935-4 to Marah, 4785 they could 3201-1 not drink 8354-2 of the waters 4325 of Marah, 4785 for they [were] bitter: 4751 therefore the name 8034 of it was called 7121-1 Marah. 4785
15:24 And the people 5971 murmured 3885-11 against Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2 What shall we drink? 8354-4
15:25 And he cried 6817-4 unto the LORD; 3068 and the LORD 3068 shewed 3384-55 him a tree, 6086 [which] when he had cast 7993-55 into the waters, 4325 the waters 4325 were made sweet: 4985-4 there he made 7760-1 for them a statute 2706 and an ordinance, 4941 and there he proved 5254-14 them,
15:26 And said, 559-4 If thou wilt diligently 8085-2 hearken 8085-4 to the voice 6963 of the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 and wilt do 6213-4 that which is right 3477 in his sight, 5869 and wilt give ear 238-52 to his commandments, 4687 and keep 8104-1 all his statutes, 2706 I will put 7760-4 none of these diseases 4245 upon thee, which I have brought 7760-1 upon the Egyptians: 4714 for I [am] the LORD 3068 that healeth 7495-6 thee.
15:27 And they came 935-4 to Elim, 362 where [were] twelve 8147 6240 wells 5869 of water, 4325 and threescore and ten 7657 palm trees: 8558 and they encamped 2583-4 there by the waters. 4325
16:1 And they took their journey 5265-4 from Elim, 362 and all the congregation 5712 of the children 1121 of Israel 3478 came 935-4 unto the wilderness 4057 of Sin, 5512 which [is] between Elim 362 and Sinai, 5514 on the fifteenth 2568 6240 day 3117 of the second 8145 month 2320 after their departing 3318-2 out of the land 776 of Egypt. 4714
16:2 And the whole congregation 5712 of the children 1121 of Israel 3478 murmured 3885-11 against Moses 4872 and Aaron 175 in the wilderness: 4057
16:3 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 said 559-4 unto them, Would to God 4310 5414-4 we had died 4191-2 by the hand 3027 of the LORD 3068 in the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 when we sat 3427-2 by the flesh 1320 pots, 5518 [and] when we did eat 398-2 bread 3899 to the full; 7648 for ye have brought us forth 3318-52 into this wilderness, 4057 to kill 4191-53 this whole assembly 6951 with hunger. 7458
16:4 Then said 559-4 the LORD 3068 unto Moses, 4872 Behold, I will rain 4305-56 bread 3899 from heaven 8064 for you; and the people 5971 shall go out 3318-1 and gather 3950-1 a certain rate 1697 every day, 3117 3117 that I may prove 5254-17 them, whether they will walk 3212-4 in my law, 8451 or no.
16:5 And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth 8345 day 3117 they shall prepare 3559-52 [that] which they bring in; 935-55 and it shall be twice 4932 as much as 834 they gather 3950-4 daily. 3117 3117
16:6 And Moses 4872 and Aaron 175 said 559-4 unto all the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 At even, 6153 then ye shall know 3045-1 that the LORD 3068 hath brought you out 3318-52 from the land 776 of Egypt: 4714
16:7 And in the morning, 1242 then ye shall see 7200-1 the glory 3519 of the LORD; 3068 for that he heareth 8085-2 your murmurings 8519 against the LORD: 3068 and what [are] we, 5168 that ye murmur 3885-55|3885-11 against us?
16:8 And Moses 4872 said, 559-4 [This shall be], when the LORD 3068 shall give 5414-2 you in the evening 6153 flesh 1320 to eat, 398-2 and in the morning 1242 bread 3899 to the full; 7646-2 for that the LORD 3068 heareth 8085-2 your murmurings 8519 which ye murmur 3885-56 against him: and what [are] we? 5168 your murmurings 8519 [are] not against us, but against the LORD. 3068
16:9 And Moses 4872 spake 559-4 unto Aaron, 175 Say 559-3 unto all the congregation 5712 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 Come near 7126-3 before 6440 the LORD: 3068 for he hath heard 8085-1 your murmurings. 8519
16:10 And it came to pass, as Aaron 175 spake 1696-15 unto the whole congregation 5712 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 that they looked 6437-4 toward the wilderness, 4057 and, behold, the glory 3519 of the LORD 3068 appeared 7200-8 in the cloud. 6051
16:11 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2
16:12 I have heard 8085-1 the murmurings 8519 of the children 1121 of Israel: 3478 speak 1696-16 unto them, saying, 559-2 At 996 even 6153 ye shall eat 398-4 flesh, 1320 and in the morning 1242 ye shall be filled 7646-4 with bread; 3899 and ye shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD 3068 your God. 430
16:13 And it came to pass, that at even 6153 the quails 7958 came up, 5927-4 and covered 3680-17 the camp: 4264 and in the morning 1242 the dew 2919 lay 7902 round about 5439 the host. 4264
16:14 And when the dew 2919 that lay 7902 was gone up, 5927-4 behold, upon the face 6440 of the wilderness 4057 [there lay] a small 1851 round thing, 2636-30 [as] small 1851 as the hoar frost 3713 on the ground. 776
16:15 And when the children 1121 of Israel 3478 saw 7200-4 [it], they said 559-4 one 376 to another, 251 It [is] manna: 4478 for they wist 3045-1 not what it [was]. And Moses 4872 said 559-4 unto them, This [is] the bread 3899 which the LORD 3068 hath given 5414-1 you to eat. 402
16:16 This [is] the thing 1697 which the LORD 3068 hath commanded, 6680-14 Gather 3950-3 of it every man 376 according 6310 to his eating, 400 an omer 6016 for every man, 1538 [according to] the number 4557 of your persons; 5315 take 3947-4 ye every man 376 for [them] which 834 [are] in his tents. 168
16:17 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 did 6213-4 so, and gathered, 3950-4 some more, 7235-56 some less. 4591-56
16:18 And when they did mete 4058-4 [it] with an omer, 6016 he that gathered much 7235-56 had nothing over, 5736-52 and he that gathered little 4591-56 had no lack; 2637-52 they gathered 3950-1 every man 376 according 6310 to his eating. 400
16:19 And Moses 4872 said, 559-4 Let no man 376 leave 3498-55 of it till the morning. 1242
16:20 Notwithstanding they hearkened 8085-1 not unto Moses; 4872 but some of them 582 left 3498-55 of it until the morning, 1242 and it bred 7311-4 worms, 8438 and stank: 887-4 and Moses 4872 was wroth 7107-4 with them.
16:21 And they gathered 3950-4 it every morning, 1242 1242 every man 376 according 6310 to his eating: 400 and when the sun 8121 waxed hot, 2552-1 it melted. 4549-8
16:22 And it came to pass, [that] on the sixth 8345 day 3117 they gathered 3950-1 twice as much 4932 bread, 3899 two 8147 omers 6016 for one 259 [man]: and all the rulers 5387 of the congregation 5712 came 935-4 and told 5046-55 Moses. 4872
16:23 And he said 559-4 unto them, This [is that] which the LORD 3068 hath said, 1696-14 To morrow 4279 [is] the rest 7677 of the holy 6944 sabbath 7676 unto the LORD: 3068 bake 644-3 [that] which ye will bake 644-4 [to day], and seethe 1310-16 that ye will seethe; 1310-17 and 3605 that which remaineth 5736-6 over lay up 3240-54 for you to be kept 4931 until the morning. 1242
16:24 And they laid it up 3240-55 till the morning, 1242 as Moses 4872 bade: 6680-14 and it did not stink, 887-52 neither was there any worm 7415 therein.
16:25 And Moses 4872 said, 559-4 Eat 398-3 that to day; 3117 for to day 3117 [is] a sabbath 7676 unto the LORD: 3068 to day 3117 ye shall not find 4672-4 it in the field. 7704
16:26 Six 8337 days 3117 ye shall gather 3950-4 it; but on the seventh 7637 day, 3117 [which is] the sabbath, 7676 in it there shall be none.
16:27 And it came to pass, [that] there went out 3318-1 [some] of the people 5971 on the seventh 7637 day 3117 for to gather, 3950-2 and they found 4672-1 none.
16:28 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 How long refuse 3985-14 ye to keep 8104-2 my commandments 4687 and my laws? 8451
16:29 See, 7200-3 for that the LORD 3068 hath given 5414-1 you the sabbath, 7676 therefore he giveth 5414-6 you on the sixth 8345 day 3117 the bread 3899 of two days; 3117 abide 3427-3 ye every man 376 in his place, let no man 376 go out 3318-4 of his place 4725 on the seventh 7637 day. 3117
16:30 So the people 5971 rested 7673-4 on the seventh 7637 day. 3117
16:31 And the house 1004 of Israel 3478 called 7121-4 the name 8034 thereof Manna: 4478 and it [was] like coriander 1407 seed, 2233 white; 3836 and the taste 2940 of it [was] like wafers 6838 [made] with honey. 1706
16:32 And Moses 4872 said, 559-4 This [is] the thing 1697 which the LORD 3068 commandeth, 6680-14 Fill 4393 an omer 6016 of it to be kept 4931 for your generations; 1755 that they may see 7200-4 the bread 3899 wherewith I have fed 398-52 you in the wilderness, 4057 when I brought you forth 3318-53 from the land 776 of Egypt. 4714
16:33 And Moses 4872 said 559-4 unto Aaron, 175 Take 3947-3 a 259 pot, 6803 and put 5414-3 an omer 6016 full 4393 of manna 4478 therein, and lay it up 3240-54 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 to be kept 4931 for your generations. 1755
16:34 As the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses, 4872 so Aaron 175 laid it up 3240-55 before 6440 the Testimony, 5715 to be kept. 4931
16:35 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 did eat 398-1 manna 4478 forty 705 years, 8141 until they came 935-2 to a land 776 inhabited; 3427-12 they did eat 398-1 manna, 4478 until they came 935-2 unto the borders 7097 of the land 776 of Canaan. 3667
16:36 Now an omer 6016 [is] the tenth 6224 [part] of an ephah. 374
17:1 And all the congregation 5712 of the children 1121 of Israel 3478 journeyed 5265-4 from the wilderness 4057 of Sin, 5512 after their journeys, 4550 according to the commandment 6310 of the LORD, 3068 and pitched 2583-4 in Rephidim: 7508 and [there was] no water 4325 for the people 5971 to drink. 8354-2
17:2 Wherefore the people 5971 did chide 7378-4 with Moses, 4872 and said, 559-4 Give 5414-3 us water 4325 that we may drink. 8354-4 And Moses 4872 said 559-4 unto them, Why chide 7378-4 ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt 5254-17 the LORD? 3068
17:3 And the people 5971 thirsted 6770-4 there for water; 4325 and the people 5971 murmured 3885-55 against Moses, 4872 and said, 559-4 Wherefore [is] this [that] thou hast brought us up 5927-52 out of Egypt, 4714 to kill 4191-53 us and our children 1121 and our cattle 4735 with thirst? 6772
17:4 And Moses 4872 cried 6817-4 unto the LORD, 3068 saying, 559-2 What shall I do 6213-4 unto this people? 5971 they be almost 4592 ready to stone 5619-1 me.
17:5 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Go on 5674-3 before 6440 the people, 5971 and take 3947-3 with thee of the elders 2205 of Israel; 3478 and thy rod, 4294 wherewith thou smotest 5221-52 the river, 2975 take 3947-3 in thine hand, 3027 and go. 1980-1
17:6 Behold, I will stand 5975-6 before 6440 thee there upon the rock 6697 in Horeb; 2722 and thou shalt smite 5221-52 the rock, 6697 and there shall come water 4325 out 3318-1 of it, that the people 5971 may drink. 8354-1 And Moses 4872 did 6213-4 so in the sight 5869 of the elders 2205 of Israel. 3478
17:7 And he called 7121-4 the name 8034 of the place 4725 Massah, 4532 and Meribah, 4809 because of the chiding 7379 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and because they tempted 5254-15 the LORD, 3068 saying, 559-2 Is 3426 the LORD 3068 among 7130 us, or not?
17:8 Then came 935-4 Amalek, 6002 and fought 3898-11 with Israel 3478 in Rephidim. 7508
17:9 And Moses 4872 said 559-4 unto Joshua, 3091 Choose 977-3 us out men, 582 and go out, 3318-3 fight 3898-10 with Amalek: 6002 to morrow 4279 I will stand 5324-12 on the top 7218 of the hill 1389 with the rod 4294 of God 430 in mine hand. 3027
17:10 So Joshua 3091 did 6213-4 as Moses 4872 had said 559-1 to him, and fought 3898-9 with Amalek: 6002 and Moses, 4872 Aaron, 175 and Hur 2354 went up 5927-1 to the top 7218 of the hill. 1389
17:11 And it came to pass, when Moses 4872 held up 7311-55 his hand, 3027 that Israel 3478 prevailed: 1396-1 and when he let down 5117-55 his hand, 3027 Amalek 6002 prevailed. 1396-1
17:12 But Moses' 4872 hands 3027 [were] heavy; 3515 and they took 3947-4 a stone, 68 and put 7760-4 [it] under him, and he sat 3427-4 thereon; and Aaron 175 and Hur 2354 stayed up 8551-1 his hands, 3027 the one 259 on the one side, and the other 259 on the other side; and his hands 3027 were steady 530 until the going down 935-2 of the sun. 8121
17:13 And Joshua 3091 discomfited 2522-4 Amalek 6002 and his people 5971 with the edge 6310 of the sword. 2719
17:14 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Write 3789-3 this [for] a memorial 2146 in a book, 5612 and rehearse 7760-3 [it] in the ears 241 of Joshua: 3091 for I will utterly 4229-2 put out 4229-4 the remembrance 2143 of Amalek 6002 from under heaven. 8064
17:15 And Moses 4872 built 1129-4 an altar, 4196 and called 7121-4 the name 8034 of it Jehovahnissi: 3068|5251|3071
17:16 For he said, 559-4 Because the LORD 3050 hath sworn 3027 3676 [that] the LORD 3068 [will have] war 4421 with Amalek 6002 from generation 1755 to generation. 1755
18:1 When Jethro, 3503 the priest 3548 of Midian, 4080 Moses' 4872 father in law, 2859-6 heard 8085-4 of all that God 430 had done 6213-1 for Moses, 4872 and for Israel 3478 his people, 5971 [and] that the LORD 3068 had brought Israel 3478 out 3318-52 of Egypt; 4714
18:2 Then Jethro, 3503 Moses' 4872 father in law, 2859-6 took 3947-4 Zipporah, 6855 Moses' 4872 wife, 802 after 310 he had sent her back, 7964
18:3 And her two 8147 sons; 1121 of which the name 8034 of the one 259 [was] Gershom; 1647 for he said, 559-1 I have been an alien 1616 in a strange 5237 land: 776
18:4 And the name 8034 of the other 259 [was] Eliezer; 461 for the God 430 of my father, 1 [said he, was] mine help, 5828 and delivered 5337-55 me from the sword 2719 of Pharaoh: 6547
18:5 And Jethro, 3503 Moses' 4872 father in law, 2859-6 came 935-4 with his sons 1121 and his wife 802 unto Moses 4872 into the wilderness, 4057 where he encamped 2583-6 at the mount 2022 of God: 430
18:6 And he said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 I thy father in law 2859-6 Jethro 3503 am come 935-6 unto thee, and thy wife, 802 and her two 8147 sons 1121 with her.
18:7 And Moses 4872 went out 3318-4 to meet 7125-2 his father in law, 2859-6 and did obeisance, 7812-101 and kissed 5401-4 him; and they asked 7592-4 each 376 other 7453 of [their] welfare; 7965 and they came 935-4 into the tent. 168
18:8 And Moses 4872 told 5608-17 his father in law 2859-6 all that the LORD 3068 had done 6213-1 unto Pharaoh 6547 and to the Egyptians 4714 for Israel's 3478 sake, 182 [and] all the travail 8513 that had come upon 4672-1 them by the way, 1870 and [how] the LORD 3068 delivered 5337-55 them.
18:9 And Jethro 3503 rejoiced 2302-4 for all the goodness 2896 which the LORD 3068 had done 6213-1 to Israel, 3478 whom he had delivered 5337-52 out of the hand 3027 of the Egyptians. 4714
18:10 And Jethro 3503 said, 559-4 Blessed 1288-7 [be] the LORD, 3068 who hath delivered 5337-52 you out of the hand 3027 of the Egyptians, 4714 and out of the hand 3027 of Pharaoh, 6547 who hath delivered 5337-52 the people 5971 from under the hand 3027 of the Egyptians. 4714
18:11 Now I know 3045-1 that the LORD 3068 [is] greater 1419 than all gods: 430 for in the thing 1697 wherein they dealt proudly 2102-1 [he was] above them.
18:12 And Jethro, 3503 Moses' 4872 father in law, 2859-6 took 3947-4 a burnt offering 5930 and sacrifices 2077 for God: 430 and Aaron 175 came, 935-4 and all the elders 2205 of Israel, 3478 to eat 398-2 bread 3899 with Moses' 4872 father in law 2859-6 before 6440 God. 430
18:13 And it came to pass on the morrow, 4283 that Moses 4872 sat 3427-4 to judge 8199-2 the people: 5971 and the people 5971 stood 5975-4 by Moses 4872 from the morning 1242 unto the evening. 6153
18:14 And when Moses' 4872 father in law 2859-6 saw 7200-4 all that he did 6213-6 to the people, 5971 he said, 559-4 What [is] this thing 1697 that thou doest 6213-6 to the people? 5971 why sittest 3427-6 thou thyself alone, and all the people 5971 stand 5324-12 by thee from morning 1242 unto even? 6153
18:15 And Moses 4872 said 559-4 unto his father in law, 2859-6 Because the people 5971 come 935-4 unto me to enquire 1875-2 of God: 430
18:16 When they have a matter, 1697 they come 935-6 unto me; and I judge 8199-1 between one 376 and another, 7453 and I do make [them] know 3045-52 the statutes 2706 of God, 430 and his laws. 8451
18:17 And Moses' 4872 father in law 2859-6 said 559-4 unto him, The thing 1697 that thou doest 6213-6 [is] not good. 2896
18:18 Thou wilt surely 5034-2 wear away, 5034-4 both thou, and this people 5971 that [is] with thee: for this thing 1697 [is] too heavy 3515 for thee; thou art not able 3201-4 to perform 6213-2 it thyself alone.
18:19 Hearken 8085-3 now unto my voice, 6963 I will give thee counsel, 3289-4 and God 430 shall be with thee: Be 1961-3 thou for the people 5971 to God-ward, 4136 430 that thou mayest bring 935-52 the causes 1697 unto God: 430
18:20 And thou shalt teach 2094-52 them 853 ordinances 2706 and laws, 8451 and shalt shew 3045-52 them the way 1870 wherein they must walk, 3212-4 and the work 4639 that they must do. 6213-4
18:21 Moreover thou shalt provide 2372-4 out of all the people 5971 able 2428 men, 582 such as fear 3373 God, 430 men 582 of truth, 571 hating 8130-6 covetousness; 1215 and place 7760-1 [such] over them, [to be] rulers 8269 of thousands, 505 [and] rulers 8269 of hundreds, 3967 rulers 8269 of fifties, 2572 and rulers 8269 of tens: 6235
18:22 And let them judge 8199-1 the people 5971 at all seasons: 6256 and it shall be, [that] every great 1419 matter 1697 they shall bring 935-55 unto thee, but every small 6996 matter 1697 they shall judge: 8199-4 so shall it be easier 7043-54 for thyself, and they shall bear 5375-1 [the burden] with thee.
18:23 If thou shalt do 6213-4 this thing, 1697 and God 430 command 6680-14 thee [so], then thou shalt be able 3201-1 to endure, 5975-2 and all this people 5971 shall also go 935-4 to their place 4725 in peace. 7965
18:24 So Moses 4872 hearkened 8085-4 to the voice 6963 of his father in law, 2859-6 and did 6213-4 all that he had said. 559-1
18:25 And Moses 4872 chose 977-4 able 2428 men 582 out of all Israel, 3478 and made 5414-4 them heads 7218 over the people, 5971 rulers 8269 of thousands, 505 rulers 8269 of hundreds, 3967 rulers 8269 of fifties, 2572 and rulers 8269 of tens. 6235
18:26 And they judged 8199-1 the people 5971 at all seasons: 6256 the hard 7186 causes 1697 they brought 935-55 unto Moses, 4872 but every small 6996 matter 1697 they judged 8199-4 themselves. 1992
18:27 And Moses 4872 let his father in law 2859-6 depart; 7971-17 and he went 3212-4 his way into his own land. 776
19:1 In the third 7992 month, 2320 when the children 1121 of Israel 3478 were gone forth 3318-2 out of the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 the same day 3117 came 935-1 they [into] the wilderness 4057 of Sinai. 5514
19:2 For they were departed 5265-4 from Rephidim, 7508 and were come 935-4 [to] the desert 4057 of Sinai, 5514 and had pitched 2583-4 in the wilderness; 4057 and there Israel 3478 camped 2583-4 before the mount. 2022
19:3 And Moses 4872 went up 5927-1 unto God, 430 and the LORD 3068 called 7121-4 unto him out of the mountain, 2022 saying, 559-2 Thus shalt thou say 559-4 to the house 1004 of Jacob, 3290 and tell 5046-55 the children 1121 of Israel; 3478
19:4 Ye have seen 7200-1 what I did 6213-1 unto the Egyptians, 4714 and [how] I bare 5375-4 you on eagles' 5404 wings, 3671 and brought 935-55 you unto myself.
19:5 Now therefore, if ye will obey 8085-4 my voice 6963 indeed, 8085-2 and keep 8104-1 my covenant, 1285 then ye shall be a peculiar treasure 5459 unto me above all people: 5971 for all the earth 776 [is] mine:
19:6 And ye shall be unto me a kingdom 4467 of priests, 3548 and an holy 6918 nation. 1471 These [are] the words 1697 which thou shalt speak 1696-17 unto the children 1121 of Israel. 3478
19:7 And Moses 4872 came 935-4 and called 7121-4 for the elders 2205 of the people, 5971 and laid 7760-4 before their faces 6440 all these words 1697 which the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 him.
19:8 And all the people 5971 answered 6030-4 together, 3162 and said, 559-4 All that the LORD 3068 hath spoken 1696-14 we will do. 6213-4 And Moses 4872 returned 7725-55 the words 1697 of the people 5971 unto the LORD. 3068
19:9 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Lo, I come 935-6 unto thee in a thick 5645 cloud, 6051 that the people 5971 may hear 8085-4 when I speak 1696-15 with thee, and believe 539-55 thee for ever. 5769 And Moses 4872 told 5046-55 the words 1697 of the people 5971 unto the LORD. 3068
19:10 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Go 3212-3 unto the people, 5971 and sanctify 6942-14 them to day 3117 and to morrow, 4279 and let them wash 3526-14 their clothes, 8071
19:11 And be ready 3559-12 against the third 7992 day: 3117 for the third 7992 day 3117 the LORD 3068 will come down 3381-4 in the sight 5869 of all the people 5971 upon mount 2022 Sinai. 5514
19:12 And thou shalt set bounds 1379-52 unto the people 5971 round about, 5439 saying, 559-2 Take heed 8104-10 to yourselves, [that ye] go [not] up 5927-2 into the mount, 2022 or touch 5060-2 the border 7097 of it: whosoever toucheth 5060-6 the mount 2022 shall be surely 4191-2 put to death: 4191-93
19:13 There shall not an hand 3027 touch 5060-4 it, but he shall surely 5619-2 be stoned, 5619-11 or 176 shot 3384-11 through; 3384-2 whether [it be] beast 929 or 518 man, 376 it shall not live: 2421-4 when the trumpet 3104 soundeth long, 4900-2 they shall come up 5927-4 to the mount. 2022
19:14 And Moses 4872 went down 3381-4 from the mount 2022 unto the people, 5971 and sanctified 6942-17 the people; 5971 and they washed 3526-17 their clothes. 8071
19:15 And he said 559-4 unto the people, 5971 Be 1961-3 ready 3559-12 against the third 7969 day: 3117 come 5066-4 not at [your] wives. 802
19:16 And it came to pass on the third 7992 day 3117 in the morning, 1242 that there were thunders 6963 and lightnings, 1300 and a thick 3515 cloud 6051 upon the mount, 2022 and the voice 6963 of the trumpet 7782 exceeding 3966 loud; 2389 so that all the people 5971 that [was] in the camp 4264 trembled. 2729-4
19:17 And Moses 4872 brought forth 3318-55 the people 5971 out of the camp 4264 to meet 7125-2 with God; 430 and they stood 3320-101 at the nether part 8482 of the mount. 2022
19:18 And mount 2022 Sinai 5514 was altogether on a smoke, 6225-1 because 6440 834 the LORD 3068 descended 3381-1 upon it in fire: 784 and the smoke 6227 thereof ascended 5927-4 as the smoke 6227 of a furnace, 3536 and the whole mount 2022 quaked 2729-4 greatly. 3966
19:19 And when the voice 6963 of the trumpet 7782 sounded long, 1980-6 and waxed louder 2390 and louder, 3966 Moses 4872 spake, 1696-17 and God 430 answered 6030-4 him by a voice. 6963
19:20 And the LORD 3068 came down 3381-4 upon mount 2022 Sinai, 5514 on 413 the top 7218 of the mount: 2022 and the LORD 3068 called 7121-4 Moses 4872 [up] to the top 7218 of the mount; 2022 and Moses 4872 went up. 5927-4
19:21 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Go down, 3381-3 charge 5749-54 the people, 5971 lest they break through 2040-4 unto the LORD 3068 to gaze, 7200-2 and many 7227 of them perish. 5307-1
19:22 And let the priests 3548 also, which come near 5066-12 to the LORD, 3068 sanctify 6942-101 themselves, lest the LORD 3068 break forth 6555-4 upon them.
19:23 And Moses 4872 said 559-4 unto the LORD, 3068 The people 5971 cannot 3808 3201-4 come up 5927-2 to mount 2022 Sinai: 5514 for thou chargedst 5749-52 us, saying, 559-2 Set bounds 1379-54 about the mount, 2022 and sanctify 6942-14 it.
19:24 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto him, Away, 3212-3 get thee down, 3381-3 and thou shalt come up, 5927-1 thou, and Aaron 175 with thee: but let not the priests 3548 and the people 5971 break through 2040-4 to come up 5927-2 unto the LORD, 3068 lest he break forth 6555-4 upon them.
19:25 So Moses 4872 went down 3381-4 unto the people, 5971 and spake 559-4 unto them.
20:1 And God 430 spake 1696-17 all these words, 1697 saying, 559-2
20:2 I [am] the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 which have brought thee out 3318-52 of the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 out of the house 1004 of bondage. 5650
20:3 Thou shalt have no other 312 gods 430 before 6440 me.
20:4 Thou shalt not make 6213-4 unto thee any graven image, 6459 or any likeness 8544 [of any thing] that [is] in heaven 8064 above, 4605 or that 834 [is] in the earth 776 beneath, or that 834 [is] in the water 4325 under the earth: 776
20:5 Thou shalt not bow down 7812-101 thyself to them, nor serve 5647-93 them: for I the LORD 3068 thy God 430 [am] a jealous 7067 God, 410 visiting 6485-6 the iniquity 5771 of the fathers 1 upon the children 1121 unto the third 8029 and fourth 7256 [generation] of them that hate 8130-6 me;
20:6 And shewing 6213-6 mercy 2617 unto thousands 505 of them that love 157-6 me, and keep 8104-6 my commandments. 4687
20:7 Thou shalt not take 5375-4 the name 8034 of the LORD 3068 thy God 430 in vain; 7723 for the LORD 3068 will not hold him guiltless 5352-17 that taketh 5375-4 his name 8034 in vain. 7723
20:8 Remember 2142-2 the sabbath 7676 day, 3117 to keep it holy. 6942-15
20:9 Six 8337 days 3117 shalt thou labour, 5647-4 and do 6213-1 all thy work: 4399
20:10 But the seventh 7637 day 3117 [is] the sabbath 7676 of the LORD 3068 thy God: 430 [in it] thou shalt not do 6213-4 any work, 4399 thou, nor thy son, 1121 nor thy daughter, 1323 thy manservant, 5650 nor thy maidservant, 519 nor thy cattle, 929 nor thy stranger 1616 that [is] within thy gates: 8179
20:11 For [in] six 8337 days 3117 the LORD 3068 made 6213-1 heaven 8064 and earth, 776 the sea, 3220 and all that in them [is], and rested 5117-4 the seventh 7637 day: 3117 wherefore the LORD 3068 blessed 1288-14 the sabbath 7676 day, 3117 and hallowed 6942-17 it.
20:12 Honour 3513-16 thy father 1 and thy mother: 517 that thy days 3117 may be long 748-55 upon the land 127 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 giveth 5414-6 thee.
20:13 Thou shalt not kill. 7523-4
20:14 Thou shalt not commit adultery. 5003-4
20:15 Thou shalt not steal. 1589-4
20:16 Thou shalt not bear 6030-4 false 8267 witness 5707 against thy neighbour. 7453
20:17 Thou shalt not covet 2530-4 thy neighbour's 7453 house, 1004 thou shalt not covet 2530-4 thy neighbour's 7453 wife, 802 nor his manservant, 5650 nor his maidservant, 519 nor his ox, 7794 nor his ass, 2543 nor any thing that [is] thy neighbour's. 7453
20:18 And all the people 5971 saw 7200-6 the thunderings, 6963 and the lightnings, 3940 and the noise 6963 of the trumpet, 7782 and the mountain 2022 smoking: 6226 and when the people 5971 saw 7200-4 [it], they removed, 5128-4 and stood 5975-4 afar off. 7350
20:19 And they said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Speak 1696-16 thou with us, and we will hear: 8085-4 but let not God 430 speak 1696-17 with us, lest we die. 4191-4
20:20 And Moses 4872 said 559-4 unto the people, 5971 Fear 3372-4 not: for God 430 is come 935-1 to 5668 prove 5254-15 you, and that his fear 3374 may be before your faces, 6440 that ye sin 2398-4 not.
20:21 And the people 5971 stood 5975-4 afar off, 7350 and Moses 4872 drew near 5066-8 unto the thick darkness 6205 where God 430 [was].
20:22 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Thus thou shalt say 559-4 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 Ye have seen 7200-1 that I have talked 1696-14 with you from heaven. 8064
20:23 Ye shall not make 6213-4 with me gods 430 of silver, 3701 neither shall ye make 6213-4 unto you gods 430 of gold. 2091
20:24 An altar 4196 of earth 127 thou shalt make 6213-4 unto me, and shalt sacrifice 2076-1 thereon thy burnt offerings, 5930 and thy peace offerings, 8002 thy sheep, 6629 and thine oxen: 1241 in all places 4725 where I record 2142-55 my name 8034 I will come 935-4 unto thee, and I will bless 1288-14 thee.
20:25 And if thou wilt make 6213-4 me an altar 4196 of stone, 68 thou shalt not build 1129-4 it of hewn stone: 1496 for if thou lift up 5130-52 thy tool 2719 upon it, thou hast polluted 2490-17 it.
20:26 Neither shalt thou go up 5927-4 by steps 4609 unto mine altar, 4196 that thy nakedness 6172 be not discovered 1540-11 thereon.
21:1 Now these [are] the judgments 4941 which thou shalt set 7760-4 before 6440 them.
21:2 If thou buy 7069-4 an Hebrew 5680 servant, 5650 six 8337 years 8141 he shall serve: 5647-4 and in the seventh 7637 he shall go out 3318-4 free 2670 for nothing. 2600
21:3 If he came in 935-4 by himself, 1610 he shall go out 3318-4 by himself: 1610 if he were married, 1167 802 then his wife 802 shall go out 3318-1 with him.
21:4 If his master 113 have given 5414-4 him a wife, 802 and she have born 3205-1 him sons 1121 or daughters; 1323 the wife 802 and her children 3206 shall be her master's, 113 and he shall go out 3318-4 by himself. 1610
21:5 And if the servant 5650 shall plainly 559-2 say, 559-4 I love 157-1 my master, 113 my wife, 802 and my children; 1121 I will not go out 3318-4 free: 2670
21:6 Then his master 113 shall bring 5066-52 him unto the judges; 430 he shall also bring 5066-52 him to the door, 1817 or unto the door post; 4201 and his master 113 shall bore 7527-1 his ear 241 through with an aul; 4836 and he shall serve 5647-1 him for ever. 5769
21:7 And if a man 376 sell 4376-4 his daughter 1323 to be a maidservant, 519 she shall not go out 3318-4 as the menservants 5650 do. 3318-2
21:8 If she please not 7451 5869 her master, 113 who hath betrothed 3259-1 her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: 6299-52 to sell 4376-2 her unto a strange 5237 nation 5971 he shall have no power, 4910-4 seeing he hath dealt deceitfully 898-2 with her.
21:9 And if he have betrothed 3259-4 her unto his son, 1121 he shall deal 6213-4 with her after the manner 4941 of daughters. 1323
21:10 If he take 3947-4 him another 312 [wife]; her food, 7607 her raiment, 3682 and her duty of marriage, 5772 shall he not diminish. 1639-4
21:11 And if he do 6213-4 not these three 7969 unto her, then shall she go out 3318-1 free 2600 without money. 3701
21:12 He that smiteth 5221-56 a man, 376 so that he die, 4191-1 shall be surely 4191-2 put to death. 4191-93
21:13 And if a man lie not in wait, 6658-1 but God 430 deliver 579-14 [him] into his hand; 3027 then I will appoint 7760-1 thee a place 4725 whither he shall flee. 5127-4
21:14 But if a man 376 come presumptuously 2102-55 upon his neighbour, 7453 to slay 2026-2 him with guile; 6195 thou shalt take 3947-4 him from mine altar, 4196 that he may die. 4191-2
21:15 And he that smiteth 5221-56 his father, 1 or his mother, 517 shall be surely 4191-2 put to death. 4191-93
21:16 And he that stealeth 1589-6 a man, 376 and selleth 4376-1 him, or if he be found 4672-8 in his hand, 3027 he shall surely 4191-2 be put to death. 4191-93
21:17 And he that curseth 7043-18 his father, 1 or his mother, 517 shall surely 4191-2 be put to death. 4191-93
21:18 And if men 582 strive 7378-4 together, and one 376 smite 5221-52 another 7453 with a stone, 68 or 176 with [his] fist, 106 and he die 4191-4 not, but keepeth 5307-1 [his] bed: 4904
21:19 If he rise 6965-4 again, and walk 1980-98 abroad 2351 upon his staff, 4938 then shall he that smote 5221-56 [him] be quit: 5352-8 only he shall pay 5414-4 [for] the loss of his time, 7674 and shall cause [him] to be thoroughly 7495-15 healed. 7495-17
21:20 And if a man 376 smite 5221-55 his servant, 5650 or his maid, 519 with a rod, 7626 and he die 4191-1 under his hand; 3027 he shall be surely 5358-2 punished. 5358-11
21:21 Notwithstanding, 389 if he continue 5975-4 a day 3117 or two, 3117 he shall not be punished: 5358-93 for he [is] his money. 3701
21:22 If men 582 strive, 5327-11 and hurt 5062-1 a woman 802 with child, 2030 so that her fruit 3206 depart 3318-1 [from her], and yet no mischief 611 follow: he shall be surely 6064-2 punished, 6064-11 according as the woman's 802 husband 1167 will lay 7896-4 upon him; and he shall pay 5414-1 as the judges 6414 [determine].
21:23 And if [any] mischief 611 follow, then thou shalt give 5414-1 life 5315 for life, 5315
21:24 Eye 5869 for eye, 5869 tooth 8127 for tooth, 8127 hand 3027 for hand, 3027 foot 7272 for foot, 7272
21:25 Burning 3555 for burning, 3555 wound 6482 for wound, 6482 stripe 2250 for stripe. 2250
21:26 And if a man 376 smite 5221-55 the eye 5869 of his servant, 5650 or the eye 5869 of his maid, 519 that it perish; 7843-14 he shall let him go 7971-17 free 2670 for his eye's 5869 sake. 8478
21:27 And if he smite out 5307-55 his manservant's 5650 tooth, 8127 or his maidservant's 519 tooth; 8127 he shall let him go 7971-17 free 2670 for his tooth's 8127 sake.
21:28 If an ox 7794 gore 5055-4 a man 376 or a woman, 802 that they die: 4191-1 then the ox 7794 shall be surely 5619-2 stoned, 5619-11 and his flesh 1320 shall not be eaten; 398-11 but the owner 1167 of the ox 7794 [shall be] quit. 5355
21:29 But if the ox 7794 were wont to push 5056 with his horn in time past, 8543 8032 and it hath been testified 5749-90 to his owner, 1167 and he hath not kept 8104-4 him in, but that he hath killed 4191-52 a man 376 or a woman; 802 the ox 7794 shall be stoned, 5619-11 and his owner 1167 also shall be put to death. 4191-93
21:30 If there be laid 7896-93 on him a sum of money, 3724 then he shall give 5414-1 for the ransom 6306 of his life 5315 whatsoever is laid 7896-93 upon him.
21:31 Whether 176 he have gored 5055-4 a son, 1121 or 176 have gored 5055-4 a daughter, 1323 according to this judgment 4941 shall it be done 6213-11 unto him.
21:32 If the ox 7794 shall push 5055-4 a manservant 5650 or a maidservant; 519 he shall give 5414-4 unto their master 113 thirty 7970 shekels 8255 of silver, 3701 and the ox 7794 shall be stoned. 5619-11
21:33 And if a man 376 shall open 6605-4 a pit, 953 or if a man 376 shall dig 3738-4 a pit, 953 and not cover 3680-17 it, and an ox 7794 or an ass 2543 fall 5307-1 therein;
21:34 The owner 1167 of the pit 953 shall make [it] good, 7999-17 [and] give 7725-55 money 3701 unto the owner 1167 of them; and the dead 4191-5 [beast] shall be his.
21:35 And if one man's 376 ox 7794 hurt 5062-4 another's, 7453 7794 that he die; 4191-1 then they shall sell 4376-1 the live 2416 ox, 7794 and divide 2673-1 the money 3701 of it; and the dead 4191-5 [ox] also they shall divide. 2673-4
21:36 Or if it be known 3045-8 that the ox 7794 hath used to push 5056 in time past, 8543 8032 and his owner 1167 hath not kept 8104-4 him in; he shall surely 7999-15 pay 7999-17 ox 7794 for ox; 7794 and the dead 4191-5 shall be his own.
22:1 If a man 376 shall steal 1589-4 an ox, 7794 or a sheep, 7716 and kill 2873-1 it, or sell 4376-1 it; he shall restore 7999-17 five 2568 oxen 1241 for an ox, 7794 and four 702 sheep 6629 for a sheep. 7716
22:2 If a thief 1590 be found 4672-11 breaking up, 4290 and be smitten 5221-90 that he die, 4191-1 [there shall] no blood 1818 [be shed] for him.
22:3 If the sun 8121 be risen 2224-1 upon him, [there shall be] blood 1818 [shed] for him; [for] he should make full 7999-15 restitution; 7999-17 if he have nothing, then he shall be sold 4376-8 for his theft. 1591
22:4 If the theft 1591 be certainly 4672-9 found 4672-11 in his hand 3027 alive, 2416 whether it be ox, 7794 or ass, 2543 or sheep; 7716 he shall restore 7999-17 double. 8147
22:5 If a man 376 shall cause a field 7704 or vineyard 3754 to be eaten, 1197-55 and shall put 7971-14 in his beast, 1165 and shall feed 1197-14 in another man's 312 field; 7704 of the best 4315 of his own field, 7704 and of the best 4315 of his own vineyard, 3754 shall he make restitution. 7999-17
22:6 If fire 784 break out, 3318-4 and catch 4672-1 in thorns, 6975 so that the stacks of corn, 1430 or the standing corn, 7054 or the field, 7704 be consumed 398-8 [therewith]; he that kindled 1197-56 the fire 1200 shall surely 7999-15 make restitution. 7999-17
22:7 If a man 376 shall deliver 5414-4 unto his neighbour 7453 money 3701 or stuff 3627 to keep, 8104-2 and it be stolen 1589-27 out of the man's 376 house; 1004 if the thief 1590 be found, 4672-11 let him pay 7999-17 double. 8147
22:8 If the thief 1590 be not 3808 found, 4672-11 then the master 1167 of the house 1004 shall be brought 7126-8 unto the judges, 430 [to see] whether 3808 he have put 7971-1 his hand 3027 unto his neighbour's 7453 goods. 4399
22:9 For all manner 1697 of trespass, 6588 [whether it be] for ox, 7794 for ass, 2543 for sheep, 7716 for raiment, 8008 [or] for any manner of lost thing, 9 which [another] challengeth 559-4 to be his, the cause 1697 of both parties 8147 shall come 935-4 before the judges; 430 [and] whom the judges 430 shall condemn, 7561-55 he shall pay 7999-17 double 8147 unto his neighbour. 7453
22:10 If a man 376 deliver 5414-4 unto his neighbour 7453 an ass, 2543 or an ox, 7794 or a sheep, 7716 or any beast, 929 to keep; 8104-2 and it die, 4191-1 or be hurt, 7665-8 or driven away, 7617-8 no man seeing 7200-6 [it]:
22:11 [Then] shall an oath 7621 of the LORD 3068 be between them both, 8147 that he hath not put 7971-1 his hand 3027 unto his neighbour's 7453 goods; 4399 and the owner 1167 of it shall accept 3947-1 [thereof], and he shall not make [it] good. 7999-17
22:12 And if it be stolen 1589-2 1589-11 from him, he shall make restitution 7999-17 unto the owner 1167 thereof.
22:13 If it be 2963-2 torn in pieces, 2963-11 [then] let him bring 935-55 it [for] witness, 5707 [and] he shall not make good 7999-17 that which was torn. 2966
22:14 And if a man 376 borrow 7592-4 [ought] of 5973 his neighbour, 7453 and it be hurt, 7665-8 or die, 4191-1 the owner 1167 thereof [being] not with it, he shall surely 7999-15 make [it] good. 7999-17
22:15 [But] if the owner 1167 thereof [be] with it, he shall not make [it] good: 7999-17 if it [be] an hired 7916 [thing], it came 935-1 for his hire. 7939
22:16 And if a man 376 entice 6601-17 a maid 1330 that is not betrothed, 781-27 and lie 7901-1 with her, he shall surely 4117-2 endow 4117-4 her to be his wife. 802
22:17 If her father 1 utterly 3985-15 refuse 3985-17 to give 5414-2 her unto him, he shall pay 8254-4 money 3701 according to the dowry 4119 of virgins. 1330
22:18 Thou shalt not suffer a witch 3784-18 to live. 2421-17
22:19 Whosoever lieth 7901-6 with a beast 929 shall surely 4191-2 be put to death. 4191-93
22:20 He that sacrificeth 2076-6 unto [any] god, 430 save 1115 unto the LORD 3068 only, he shall be utterly destroyed. 2763-93
22:21 Thou shalt neither vex 3238-55 a stranger, 1616 nor oppress 3905-4 him: for ye were strangers 1616 in the land 776 of Egypt. 4714
22:22 Ye shall not afflict 6031-17 any widow, 490 or fatherless child. 3490
22:23 If thou afflict 6031-17 them in any wise, 6031-15 and 518 they cry 6817-4 at all 6817-2 unto me, I will surely 8085-2 hear 8085-4 their cry; 6818
22:24 And my wrath 639 shall wax hot, 2734-1 and I will kill 2026-1 you with the sword; 2719 and your wives 802 shall be widows, 490 and your children 1121 fatherless. 3490
22:25 If thou lend 3867-55 money 3701 to [any of] my people 5971 [that is] poor 6041 by thee, thou shalt not be to him as an usurer, 5383-6 neither shalt thou lay 7760-4 upon him usury. 5392
22:26 If thou at all 2254-2 take thy neighbour's 7453 raiment 8008 to pledge, 2254-4 thou shalt deliver 7725-55 it unto him by that 5704 the sun 8121 goeth down: 935-2
22:27 For that [is] his covering 3682 only, it [is] his raiment 8071 for his skin: 5785 wherein shall he sleep? 7901-4 and it shall come to pass, when he crieth 6817-4 unto me, that I will hear; 8085-1 for I [am] gracious. 2587
22:28 Thou shalt not revile 7043-17 the gods, 430 nor curse 779-4 the ruler 5387 of thy people. 5971
22:29 Thou shalt not delay 309-17 [to offer] the first of thy ripe fruits, 4395 and of thy liquors: 1831 the firstborn 1060 of thy sons 1121 shalt thou give 5414-4 unto me.
22:30 Likewise 3651 shalt thou do 6213-4 with thine oxen, 7794 [and] with thy sheep: 6629 seven 7651 days 3117 it shall be with his dam; 517 on the eighth 8066 day 3117 thou shalt give 5414-4 it me.
22:31 And ye shall be holy 6944 men 582 unto me: neither shall ye eat 398-4 [any] flesh 1320 [that is] torn of beasts 2966 in the field; 7704 ye shall cast 7993-55 it to the dogs. 3611
23:1 Thou shalt not raise 5375-4 a false 7723 report: 8088 put 7896-4 not thine hand 3027 with the wicked 7563 to be an unrighteous 2555 witness. 5707
23:2 Thou shalt not follow 310 a multitude 7227 to [do] evil; 7451 neither shalt thou speak 6030-4 in a cause 7379 to decline 5186-2 after 310 many 7227 to wrest 5186-53 [judgment]:
23:3 Neither shalt thou countenance 1921-4 a poor 1800 man in his cause. 7379
23:4 If thou meet 6293-4 thine enemy's 341-6 ox 7794 or his ass 2543 going astray, 8582-6 thou shalt surely 7725-53 bring it back 7725-55 to him again.
23:5 If thou see 7200-4 the ass 2543 of him that hateth 8130-6 thee lying 7257-6 under his burden, 4853 and wouldest forbear 2308-1 to help 5800-2 him, thou shalt surely 5800-2 help 5800-4 with him.
23:6 Thou shalt not wrest 5186-55 the judgment 4941 of thy poor 34 in his cause. 7379
23:7 Keep thee far 7368-4 from a false 8267 matter; 1697 and the innocent 5355 and righteous 6662 slay 2026-4 thou not: for I will not justify 6663-55 the wicked. 7563
23:8 And thou shalt take 3947-4 no gift: 7810 for the gift 7810 blindeth 5786-17 the wise, 6493 and perverteth 5557-17 the words 1697 of the righteous. 6662
23:9 Also thou shalt not oppress 3905-4 a stranger: 1616 for ye know 3045-1 the heart 5315 of a stranger, 1616 seeing 3588 ye were strangers 1616 in the land 776 of Egypt. 4714
23:10 And six 8337 years 8141 thou shalt sow 2232-4 thy land, 776 and shalt gather 622-1 in the fruits 8393 thereof:
23:11 But the seventh 7637 [year] thou shalt let it rest 8058-4 and lie still; 5203-1 that the poor 34 of thy people 5971 may eat: 398-1 and what they leave 3499 the beasts 2416 of the field 7704 shall eat. 398-4 In like manner thou shalt deal 6213-4 with thy vineyard, 3754 [and] with thy oliveyard. 2132
23:12 Six 8337 days 3117 thou shalt do 6213-4 thy work, 4639 and on the seventh 7637 day 3117 thou shalt rest: 7673-4 that thine ox 7794 and thine ass 2543 may rest, 5117-4 and the son 1121 of thy handmaid, 519 and the stranger, 1616 may be refreshed. 5314-11
23:13 And in all [things] that I have said 559-1 unto you be circumspect: 8104-11 and make no mention 2142-55 of the name 8034 of other 312 gods, 430 neither let it be heard 8085-11 out 5921 of thy mouth. 6310
23:14 Three 7969 times 7272 thou shalt keep a feast 2287-4 unto me in the year. 8141
23:15 Thou shalt keep 8104-4 the feast 2282 of unleavened bread: 4682 (thou shalt eat 398-4 unleavened bread 4682 seven 7651 days, 3117 as I commanded 6680-14 thee, in the time appointed 4150 of the month 2320 Abib; 24 for in it thou camest out 3318-1 from Egypt: 4714 and none shall appear 7200-11 before 6440 me empty:) 7387
23:16 And the feast 2282 of harvest, 7105 the firstfruits 1061 of thy labours, 4639 which thou hast sown 2232-4 in the field: 7704 and the feast 2282 of ingathering, 614 [which is] in the end 3318-2 of the year, 8141 when thou hast gathered 622-2 in thy labours 4639 out of the field. 7704
23:17 Three 7969 times 6471 in the year 8141 all thy males 2138 shall appear 7200-11 before 6440 the Lord 113 GOD. 3068
23:18 Thou shalt not offer 2076-4 the blood 1818 of my sacrifice 2077 with leavened bread; 2557 neither shall the fat 2459 of my sacrifice 2282 remain 3885-4 until the morning. 1242
23:19 The first 7225 of the firstfruits 1061 of thy land 127 thou shalt bring 935-55 into the house 1004 of the LORD 3068 thy God. 430 Thou shalt not seethe 1310-17 a kid 1423 in his mother's 517 milk. 2461
23:20 Behold, I send 7971-6 an Angel 4397 before 6440 thee, to keep 8104-2 thee in the way, 1870 and to bring 935-53 thee into the place 4725 which I have prepared. 3559-52
23:21 Beware 8104-10 of 6440 him, and obey 8085-3 his voice, 6963 provoke 4843-55 him not; for he will not pardon 5375-4 your transgressions: 6588 for my name 8034 [is] in 7130 him.
23:22 But if thou shalt indeed 8085-2 obey 8085-4 his voice, 6963 and do 6213-1 all that I speak; 1696-17 then I will be an enemy 340-1 unto thine enemies, 341-6 and an adversary 6696-1 unto thine adversaries. 6887-6
23:23 For mine Angel 4397 shall go 3212-4 before 6440 thee, and bring 935-52 thee in unto the Amorites, 567 and the Hittites, 2850 and the Perizzites, 6522 and the Canaanites, 3669 the Hivites, 2340 and the Jebusites: 2983 and I will cut them off. 3582-52
23:24 Thou shalt not bow down 7812-101 to their gods, 430 nor serve 5647-93 them, nor do 6213-4 after their works: 4639 but thou shalt utterly 2040-15 overthrow 2040-17 them, and quite 7665-15 break down 7665-17 their images. 4676
23:25 And ye shall serve 5647-1 the LORD 3068 your God, 430 and he shall bless 1288-14 thy bread, 3899 and thy water; 4325 and I will take sickness 4245 away 5493-52 from the midst 7130 of thee.
23:26 There shall nothing cast their young, 7921-18 nor be barren, 6135 in thy land: 776 the number 4557 of thy days 3117 I will fulfil. 4390-17
23:27 I will send 7971-17 my fear 367 before 6440 thee, and will destroy 2000-1 all the people 5971 to whom thou shalt come, 935-4 and I will make 5414-1 all thine enemies 341-6 turn their backs 6203 unto thee.
23:28 And I will send 7971-1 hornets 6880 before 6440 thee, which shall drive out 1644-14 the Hivite, 2340 the Canaanite, 3669 and the Hittite, 2850 from before 6440 thee.
23:29 I will not drive them out 1644-17 from before 6440 thee in one 259 year; 8141 lest the land 776 become desolate, 8077 and the beast 2416 of the field 7704 multiply 7227 against thee.
23:30 By little 4592 and little 4592 I will drive them out 1644-17 from before 6440 thee, until thou be increased, 6509-4 and inherit 5157-1 the land. 776
23:31 And I will set 7896-1 thy bounds 1366 from the Red 5488 sea 3220 even unto the sea 3220 of the Philistines, 6430 and from the desert 4057 unto the river: 5104 for I will deliver 5414-4 the inhabitants 3427-6 of the land 776 into your hand; 3027 and thou shalt drive them out 1644-14 before 6440 thee.
23:32 Thou shalt make 3772-4 no covenant 1285 with them, nor with their gods. 430
23:33 They shall not dwell 3427-4 in thy land, 776 lest they make thee sin 2398-55 against me: for if thou serve 5647-4 their gods, 430 it will surely be a snare 4170 unto thee.
24:1 And he said 559-1 unto Moses, 4872 Come up 5927-3 unto the LORD, 3068 thou, and Aaron, 175 Nadab, 5070 and Abihu, 30 and seventy 7657 of the elders 2205 of Israel; 3478 and worship 7812-98 ye afar off. 7350
24:2 And Moses 4872 alone shall come near 5066-8 the LORD: 3068 but they shall not come nigh; 5066-4 neither shall the people 5971 go up 5927-4 with him.
24:3 And Moses 4872 came 935-4 and told 5608-17 the people 5971 all the words 1697 of the LORD, 3068 and all the judgments: 4941 and all the people 5971 answered 6030-4 with one 259 voice, 6963 and said, 559-4 All the words 1697 which the LORD 3068 hath said 1696-14 will we do. 6213-4
24:4 And Moses 4872 wrote 3789-4 all the words 1697 of the LORD, 3068 and rose up early 7925-55 in the morning, 1242 and builded 1129-4 an altar 4196 under the hill, 2022 and twelve 8147 6240 pillars, 4676 according to the twelve 8147 6240 tribes 7626 of Israel. 3478
24:5 And he sent 7971-4 young men 5288 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 which offered 5927-55 burnt offerings, 5930 and sacrificed 2076-4 peace 8002 offerings 2077 of oxen 6499 unto the LORD. 3068

29:17 And thou shalt cut 5408-17 the ram 352 in pieces, 5409 and wash 7364-1 the inwards 7130 of him, and his legs, 3767 and put 5414-1 [them] unto his pieces, 5409 and unto his head. 7218
29:18 And thou shalt burn 6999-52 the whole ram 352 upon the altar: 4196 it [is] a burnt offering 5930 unto the LORD: 3068 it [is] a sweet 5207 savour, 7381 an offering made by fire 801 unto the LORD. 3068
29:19 And thou shalt take 3947-1 the other 8145 ram; 352 and Aaron 175 and his sons 1121 shall put 5564-1 their hands 3027 upon the head 7218 of the ram. 352
29:20 Then shalt thou kill 7819-1 the ram, 352 and take 3947-1 of his blood, 1818 and put 5414-1 [it] upon the tip 8571 of the right ear 241 of Aaron, 175 and upon the tip 8571 of the right 3233 ear 241 of his sons, 1121 and upon the thumb 931 of their right 3233 hand, 3027 and upon the great toe 931 of their right 3233 foot, 7272 and sprinkle 2236-1 the blood 1818 upon the altar 4196 round about. 5439
29:21 And thou shalt take 3947-1 of the blood 1818 that [is] upon the altar, 4196 and of the anointing 4888 oil, 8081 and sprinkle 5137-52 [it] upon Aaron, 175 and upon his garments, 899 and upon his sons, 1121 and upon the garments 899 of his sons 1121 with him: and he shall be hallowed, 6942-1 and his garments, 899 and his sons, 1121 and his sons' 1121 garments 899 with him.
29:22 Also thou shalt take 3947-1 of the ram 352 the fat 2459 and the rump, 451 and the fat 2459 that covereth 3680-18 the inwards, 7130 and the caul 3508 [above] the liver, 3516 and the two 8147 kidneys, 3629 and the fat 2459 that [is] upon them, and the right 3225 shoulder; 7785 for it [is] a ram 352 of consecration: 4394
29:23 And one 259 loaf 3603 of bread, 3899 and one 259 cake 2471 of oiled 8081 bread, 3899 and one 259 wafer 7550 out of the basket 5536 of the unleavened bread 4682 that [is] before 6440 the LORD: 3068
29:24 And thou shalt put 7760-1 all in the hands 3709 of Aaron, 175 and in the hands 3709 of his sons; 1121 and shalt wave 5130-52 them [for] a wave offering 8573 before 6440 the LORD. 3068
29:25 And thou shalt receive 3947-1 them of their hands, 3027 and burn 6999-52 [them] upon the altar 4196 for a burnt offering, 5930 for a sweet 5207 savour 7381 before 6440 the LORD: 3068 it [is] an offering made by fire 801 unto the LORD. 3068
29:26 And thou shalt take 3947-1 the breast 2373 of the ram 352 of Aaron's 175 consecration, 4394 and wave 5130-52 it [for] a wave offering 8573 before 6440 the LORD: 3068 and it shall be thy part. 4490
29:27 And thou shalt sanctify 6942-14 the breast 2373 of the wave offering, 8573 and the shoulder 7785 of the heave offering, 8641 which is waved, 5130-90 and which is heaved up, 7311-90 of the ram 352 of the consecration, 4394 [even] of [that] which 834 [is] for Aaron, 175 and of [that] which is for his sons: 1121
29:28 And it shall be Aaron's 175 and his sons' 1121 by a statute 2706 for ever 5769 from the children 1121 of Israel: 3478 for it [is] an heave offering: 8641 and it shall be an heave offering 8641 from the children 1121 of Israel 3478 of the sacrifice 2077 of their peace offerings, 8002 [even] their heave offering 8641 unto the LORD. 3068
29:29 And the holy 6944 garments 899 of Aaron 175 shall be his sons' 1121 after 310 him, to be anointed 4888 therein, and to be consecrated 4390-15 3027 in them.
29:30 [And] that son 1121 that is priest 3548 in his stead shall put them on 3847-4 seven 7651 days, 3117 when he cometh 935-4 into the tabernacle 168 of the congregation 4150 to minister 8334-15 in the holy 6944 [place].
29:31 And thou shalt take 3947-4 the ram 352 of the consecration, 4394 and seethe 1310-14 his flesh 1320 in the holy 6918 place. 4725
29:32 And Aaron 175 and his sons 1121 shall eat 398-1 the flesh 1320 of the ram, 352 and the bread 3899 that [is] in the basket, 5536 [by] the door 6607 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation. 4150
29:33 And they shall eat 398-1 those things wherewith the atonement 3722-27 was made, to consecrate 4390-15 3027 [and] to sanctify 6942-15 them: but a stranger 2114-5 shall not eat 398-4 [thereof], because they [are] holy. 6944
29:34 And if ought of the flesh 1320 of the consecrations, 4394 or of the bread, 3899 remain 3498-11 unto the morning, 1242 then thou shalt burn 8313-1 the remainder 3498-12 with fire: 784 it shall not be eaten, 398-11 because it [is] holy. 6944
29:35 And thus shalt thou do 6213-1 unto Aaron, 175 and to his sons, 1121 according to all [things] which I have commanded 6680-14 thee: seven 7651 days 3117 shalt thou consecrate 4390-17 3027 them.
29:36 And thou shalt offer 6213-4 every day 3117 a bullock 6499 [for] a sin offering 2403 for atonement: 3725 and thou shalt cleanse 2398-14 the altar, 4196 when thou hast made an atonement 3722-15 for it, and thou shalt anoint 4886-1 it, to sanctify 6942-15 it.
29:37 Seven 7651 days 3117 thou shalt make an atonement 3722-17 for the altar, 4196 and sanctify 6942-14 it; and it shall be an altar 4196 most 6944 holy: 6944 whatsoever toucheth 5060-6 the altar 4196 shall be holy. 6942-4
29:38 Now this [is that] which thou shalt offer 6213-4 upon the altar; 4196 two 8147 lambs 3532 of the first 1121 year 8141 day 3117 by day 3117 continually. 8548
29:39 The one 259 lamb 3532 thou shalt offer 6213-4 in the morning; 1242 and the other 8145 lamb 3532 thou shalt offer 6213-4 at even: 6153
29:40 And with the one 259 lamb 3532 a tenth deal 6241 of flour 5560 mingled 1101-7 with the fourth 7253 part of an hin 1969 of beaten 3795 oil; 8081 and the fourth 7243 part of an hin 1969 of wine 3196 [for] a drink offering. 5262
29:41 And the other 8145 lamb 3532 thou shalt offer 6213-4 at even, 6153 and shalt do 6213-4 thereto according to the meat offering 4503 of the morning, 1242 and according to the drink offering 5262 thereof, for a sweet 5207 savour, 7381 an offering made by fire 801 unto the LORD. 3068
29:42 [This shall be] a continual 8548 burnt offering 5930 throughout your generations 1755 [at] the door 6607 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation 4150 before 6440 the LORD: 3068 where I will meet 3259-11 you, to speak 1696-15 there unto thee.
29:43 And there I will meet 3259-8 with the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and [the tabernacle] shall be sanctified 6942-8 by my glory. 3519
29:44 And I will sanctify 6942-14 the tabernacle 168 of the congregation, 4150 and the altar: 4196 I will sanctify 6942-17 also both Aaron 175 and his sons, 1121 to minister to me in the priest's office. 3547-15
29:45 And I will dwell 7931-1 among 8432 the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and will be their God. 430
29:46 And they shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD 3068 their God, 430 that brought them forth 3318-52 out of the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 that I may dwell 7931-2 among 8432 them: I [am] the LORD 3068 their God. 430
30:1 And thou shalt make 6213-1 an altar 4196 to burn 4729 incense 7004 upon: [of] shittim 7848 wood 6086 shalt thou make 6213-4 it.
30:2 A cubit 520 [shall be] the length 753 thereof, and a cubit 520 the breadth 7341 thereof; foursquare 7251-7 shall it be: and two cubits 520 [shall be] the height 6967 thereof: the horns 7161 thereof [shall be] of the same.
30:3 And thou shalt overlay 6823-14 it with pure 2889 gold, 2091 the top 1406 thereof, and the sides 7023 thereof round about, 5439 and the horns 7161 thereof; and thou shalt make 6213-1 unto it a crown 2213 of gold 2091 round about. 5439
30:4 And two 8147 golden 2091 rings 2885 shalt thou make 6213-4 to it under the crown 2213 of it, by the two 8147 corners 6763 thereof, upon the two 8147 sides 6654 of it shalt thou make 6213-4 [it]; and they shall be for places 1004 for the staves 905 to bear 5375-2 it withal. 1992
30:5 And thou shalt make 6213-1 the staves 905 [of] shittim 7848 wood, 6086 and overlay 6823-14 them with gold. 2091
30:6 And thou shalt put 5414-1 it before 6440 the vail 6532 that [is] by the ark 727 of the testimony, 5715 before 6440 the mercy seat 3727 that [is] over the testimony, 5715 where I will meet 3259-11 with thee.
30:7 And Aaron 175 shall burn 6999-52 thereon sweet 5561 incense 7004 every morning: 1242 1242 when he dresseth 3190-53 the lamps, 5216 he shall burn incense 6999-55 upon it.
30:8 And when Aaron 175 lighteth 5927-53 the lamps 5216 at even, 6153 he shall burn incense 6999-55 upon it, a perpetual 8548 incense 7004 before 6440 the LORD 3068 throughout your generations. 1755
30:9 Ye shall offer 5927-55 no strange 2114-5 incense 7004 thereon, nor burnt sacrifice, 5930 nor meat offering; 4503 neither shall ye pour 5258-4 drink offering 5262 thereon.
30:10 And Aaron 175 shall make an atonement 3722-14 upon the horns 7161 of it once 259 in a year 8141 with the blood 1818 of the sin offering 2403 of atonements: 3725 once 259 in the year 8141 shall he make atonement 3722-17 upon it throughout your generations: 1755 it [is] most 6944 holy 6944 unto the LORD. 3068
30:11 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2
30:12 When thou takest 5375-4 the sum 7218 of the children 1121 of Israel 3478 after their number, 6485-7 then shall they give 5414-1 every man 376 a ransom 3724 for his soul 5315 unto the LORD, 3068 when thou numberest 6485-2 them; that there be no plague 5063 among them, when [thou] numberest 6485-2 them.
30:13 This they shall give, 5414-4 every one that passeth 5674-6 among 5921 them that are numbered, 6485-7 half 4276 a shekel 8255 after the shekel 8255 of the sanctuary: 6944 (a shekel 8255 [is] twenty 6242 gerahs:) 1626 an half 4276 shekel 8255 [shall be] the offering 8641 of the LORD. 3068
30:14 Every one that passeth 5674-6 among them that are numbered, 6485-7 from twenty 6242 years 8141 old 1121 and above, 4605 shall give 5414-4 an offering 8641 unto the LORD. 3068
30:15 The rich 6223 shall not give more, 7235-55 and the poor 1800 shall not give less 4591-55 than half 4276 a shekel, 8255 when [they] give 5414-2 an offering 8641 unto the LORD, 3068 to make an atonement 3722-15 for your souls. 5315
30:16 And thou shalt take 3947-1 the atonement 3725 money 3701 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and shalt appoint 5414-1 it for the service 5656 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation; 4150 that it may be a memorial 2146 unto the children 1121 of Israel 3478 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 to make an atonement 3722-15 for your souls. 5315
30:17 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2
30:18 Thou shalt also make 6213-1 a laver 3595 [of] brass, 5178 and his foot 3653 [also of] brass, 5178 to wash 7364-2 [withal]: and thou shalt put 5414-1 it between the tabernacle 168 of the congregation 4150 and the altar, 4196 and thou shalt put 5414-1 water 4325 therein.
30:19 For Aaron 175 and his sons 1121 shall wash 7364-1 their hands 3027 and their feet 7272 thereat:
30:20 When they go 935-2 into the tabernacle 168 of the congregation, 4150 they shall wash 7364-4 with water, 4325 that they die 4191-4 not; or when they come near 5066-2 to the altar 4196 to minister, 8334-15 to burn 6999-53 offering made by fire 801 unto the LORD: 3068
30:21 So they shall wash 7364-1 their hands 3027 and their feet, 7272 that they die 4191-4 not: and it shall be a statute 2706 for ever 5769 to them, [even] to him and to his seed 2233 throughout their generations. 1755
30:22 Moreover the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2
30:23 Take 3947-3 thou also unto thee principal 7218 spices, 1314 of pure 1865 myrrh 4753 five 2568 hundred 3967 [shekels], and of sweet 1314 cinnamon 7076 half 4276 so much, [even] two hundred 3967 and fifty 2572 [shekels], and of sweet 1314 calamus 7070 two hundred 3967 and fifty 2572 [shekels],
30:24 And of cassia 6916 five 2568 hundred 3967 [shekels], after the shekel 8255 of the sanctuary, 6944 and of oil 8081 olive 2132 an hin: 1969
30:25 And thou shalt make 6213-1 it an oil 8081 of holy 6944 ointment, 4888 an ointment 7545 compound 4842 after the art 4639 of the apothecary: 7543-6 it shall be an holy 6944 anointing 4888 oil. 8081
30:26 And thou shalt anoint 4886-1 the tabernacle 168 of the congregation 4150 therewith, and the ark 727 of the testimony, 5715
30:27 And the table 7979 and all his vessels, 3627 and the candlestick 4501 and his vessels, 3627 and the altar 4196 of incense, 7004
30:28 And the altar 4196 of burnt offering 5930 with all his vessels, 3627 and the laver 3595 and his foot. 3653
30:29 And thou shalt sanctify 6942-14 them, that they may be most 6944 holy: 6944 whatsoever toucheth 5060-6 them shall be holy. 6942-4
30:30 And thou shalt anoint 4886-4 Aaron 175 and his sons, 1121 and consecrate 6942-14 them, that [they] may minister unto me in the priest's office. 3547-15
30:31 And thou shalt speak 1696-17 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 saying, 559-2 This shall be an holy 6944 anointing 4888 oil 8081 unto me throughout your generations. 1755
30:32 Upon man's 120 flesh 1320 shall it not be poured, 3251-4 neither shall ye make 6213-4 [any other] like it, after the composition 4971 of it: it [is] holy, 6944 [and] it shall be holy 6944 unto you.
30:33 Whosoever 834 376 compoundeth 7543-4 [any] like it, or whosoever putteth 5414-4 [any] of it upon a stranger, 2114-5 shall even be cut off 3772-8 from his people. 5971
30:34 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Take 3947-3 unto thee sweet spices, 5561 stacte, 5198 and onycha, 7827 and galbanum; 2464 [these] sweet spices 5561 with pure 2134 frankincense: 3828 of each 905 shall there be a like 905 [weight]:
30:35 And thou shalt make 6213-1 it a perfume, 7004 a confection 7545 after the art 4639 of the apothecary, 7543-6 tempered 4414-30 together, pure 2889 [and] holy: 6944
30:36 And thou shalt beat 7833-1 [some] of it very small, 1854-53 and put 5414-1 of it before 6440 the testimony 5715 in the tabernacle 168 of the congregation, 4150 where I will meet 3259-11 with thee: it shall be unto you most 6944 holy. 6944
30:37 And [as for] the perfume 7004 which thou shalt make, 6213-4 ye shall not make 6213-4 to yourselves according to the composition 4971 thereof: it shall be unto thee holy 6944 for the LORD. 3068
30:38 Whosoever 834 376 shall make 6213-4 like unto that, to smell 7306-53 thereto, shall even be cut off 3772-8 from his people. 5971
31:1 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2
31:2 See, 7200-3 I have called 7121-1 by name 8034 Bezaleel 1212 the son 1121 of Uri, 221 the son 1121 of Hur, 2354 of the tribe 4294 of Judah: 3063
31:3 And I have filled 4390-17 him with the spirit 7307 of God, 430 in wisdom, 2451 and in understanding, 8394 and in knowledge, 1847 and in all manner of workmanship, 4399
31:4 To devise 2803-2 cunning works, 4284 to work 6213-2 in gold, 2091 and in silver, 3701 and in brass, 5178
31:5 And in cutting 2799 of stones, 68 to set 4390-15 [them], and in carving 2799 of timber, 6086 to work 6213-2 in all manner of workmanship. 4399
31:6 And I, behold, I have given 5414-1 with him Aholiab, 171 the son 1121 of Ahisamach, 294 of the tribe 4294 of Dan: 1835 and in the hearts 3820 of all that are wise 2450 hearted 3820 I have put 5414-1 wisdom, 2451 that they may make 6213-1 all that I have commanded 6680-14 thee;
31:7 The tabernacle 168 of the congregation, 4150 and the ark 727 of the testimony, 5715 and the mercy seat 3727 that [is] thereupon, and all the furniture 3627 of the tabernacle, 168
31:8 And the table 7979 and his furniture, 3627 and the pure 2889 candlestick 4501 with all his furniture, 3627 and the altar 4196 of incense, 7004
31:9 And the altar 4196 of burnt offering 5930 with all his furniture, 3627 and the laver 3595 and his foot, 3653
31:10 And the cloths 899 of service, 8278 and the holy 6944 garments 899 for Aaron 175 the priest, 3548 and the garments 899 of his sons, 1121 to minister in the priest's office, 3547-15
31:11 And the anointing 4888 oil, 8081 and sweet 5561 incense 7004 for the holy 6944 [place]: according to all that I have commanded 6680-14 thee shall they do. 6213-4
31:12 And the LORD 3068 spake 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2
31:13 Speak 1696-16 thou also unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 saying, 559-2 Verily 389 my sabbaths 7676 ye shall keep: 8104-4 for it [is] a sign 226 between me and you throughout your generations; 1755 that [ye] may know 3045-2 that I [am] the LORD 3068 that doth sanctify 6942-18 you.
31:14 Ye shall keep 8104-1 the sabbath 7676 therefore; for it [is] holy 6944 unto you: every one that defileth 2490-18 it shall surely 4191-2 be put to death: 4191-93 for whosoever doeth 6213-6 [any] work 4399 therein, that soul 5315 shall be cut off 3772-8 from among 7130 his people. 5971
31:15 Six 8337 days 3117 may work 4399 be done; 6213-11 but in the seventh 7637 3117 [is] the sabbath 7676 of rest, 7677 holy 6944 to the LORD: 3068 whosoever doeth 6213-6 [any] work 4399 in the sabbath 7676 day, 3117 he shall surely 4191-2 be put to death. 4191-93
31:16 Wherefore the children 1121 of Israel 3478 shall keep 8104-1 the sabbath, 7676 to observe 6213-2 the sabbath 7676 throughout their generations, 1755 [for] a perpetual 5769 covenant. 1285
31:17 It [is] a sign 226 between me and the children 1121 of Israel 3478 for ever: 5769 for [in] six 8337 days 3117 the LORD 3068 made 6213-1 heaven 8064 and earth, 776 and on the seventh 7637 day 3117 he rested, 7673-1 and was refreshed. 5314-11
31:18 And he gave 5414-4 unto Moses, 4872 when he had made an end 3615-15 of communing 1696-15 with him upon mount 2022 Sinai, 5514 two 8147 tables 3871 of testimony, 5715 tables 3871 of stone, 68 written 3789-7 with the finger 676 of God. 430
32:1 And when the people 5971 saw 7200-4 that Moses 4872 delayed 954-14 to come down 3381-2 out of the mount, 2022 the people 5971 gathered themselves together 6950-11 unto Aaron, 175 and said 559-4 unto him, Up, 6965-3 make 6213-3 us gods, 430 which shall go 3212-4 before 6440 us; for [as for] this Moses, 4872 the man 376 that brought us up 5927-52 out of the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 we wot 3045-1 not what is become of him.
32:2 And Aaron 175 said 559-4 unto them, Break off 6561-16 the golden 2091 earrings, 5141 which [are] in the ears 241 of your wives, 802 of your sons, 1121 and of your daughters, 1323 and bring 935-54 [them] unto me.
32:3 And all the people 5971 brake off 6561-101 the golden 2091 earrings 5141 which [were] in their ears, 241 and brought 935-55 [them] unto Aaron. 175
32:4 And he received 3947-4 [them] at their hand, 3027 and fashioned 6696-4 it with a graving tool, 2747 after he had made 6213-4 it a molten 4541 calf: 5695 and they said, 559-4 These [be] thy gods, 430 O Israel, 3478 which brought thee up 5927-52 out of the land 776 of Egypt. 4714
32:5 And when Aaron 175 saw 7200-4 [it], he built 1129-4 an altar 4196 before 6440 it; and Aaron 175 made proclamation, 7121-4 and said, 559-4 To morrow 4279 [is] a feast 2282 to the LORD. 3068
32:6 And they rose up early 7925-55 on the morrow, 4283 and offered 5927-55 burnt offerings, 5930 and brought 5066-55 peace offerings; 8002 and the people 5971 sat down 3427-4 to eat 398-2 and to drink, 8354-2 and rose up 6965-4 to play. 6711-15
32:7 And the LORD 3068 said 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 Go, 3212-3 get thee down; 3381-3 for thy people, 5971 which thou broughtest 5927-52 out of the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 have corrupted 7843-14 [themselves]:
32:8 They have turned aside 5493-1 quickly 4118 out of the way 1870 which I commanded 6680-14 them: they have made 6213-1 them a molten 4541 calf, 5695 and have worshipped 7812-101 it, and have sacrificed 2076-4 thereunto, and said, 559-4 These [be] thy gods, 430 O Israel, 3478 which have brought thee up 5927-52 out of the land 776 of Egypt. 4714
32:9 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 I have seen 7200-1 this people, 5971 and, behold, it [is] a stiffnecked 7186 6203 people: 5971
32:10 Now therefore let me alone, 3240-54 that my wrath 639 may wax hot 2734-4 against them, and that I may consume 3615-17 them: and I will make 6213-4 of thee a great 1419 nation. 1471
32:11 And Moses 4872 besought 2470-17 6440 the LORD 3068 his God, 430 and said, 559-4 LORD, 3068 why doth thy wrath 639 wax hot 2734-4 against thy people, 5971 which thou hast brought forth 3318-52 out of the land 776 of Egypt 4714 with great 1419 power, 3581 and with a mighty 2389 hand? 3027
32:12 Wherefore should the Egyptians 4714 speak, 559-4 and say, 559-2 For mischief 7451 did he bring them out, 3318-52 to slay 2026-2 them in the mountains, 2022 and to consume 3615-15 them from the face 6440 of the earth? 127 Turn 7725-3 from thy fierce 2740 wrath, 639 and repent 5162-10 of this evil 7451 against thy people. 5971
32:13 Remember 2142-3 Abraham, 85 Isaac, 3327 and Israel, 3478 thy servants, 5650 to whom thou swarest 7650-8 by thine own self, and saidst 1696-17 unto them, I will multiply 7235-55 your seed 2233 as the stars 3556 of heaven, 8064 and all this land 776 that I have spoken 559-1 of will I give 5414-4 unto your seed, 2233 and they shall inherit 5157-1 [it] for ever. 5769
32:14 And the LORD 3068 repented 5162-11 of the evil 7451 which he thought 1696-14 to do 6213-2 unto his people. 5971
32:15 And Moses 4872 turned, 6437-4 and went down 3381-4 from the mount, 2022 and the two 8147 tables 3871 of the testimony 5715 [were] in his hand: 3027 the tables 3871 [were] written 3789-7 on both 8147 their sides; 5676 on the one side and on the other [were] they written. 3789-7
32:16 And the tables 3871 [were] the work 4639 of God, 430 and the writing 4385 [was] the writing 4385 of God, 430 graven 2801-7 upon the tables. 3871
32:17 And when Joshua 3091 heard 8085-4 the noise 6963 of the people 5971 as they shouted, 7452 he said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 [There is] a noise 6963 of war 4421 in the camp. 4264
32:18 And he said, 559-4 [It is] not the voice 6963 of [them that] shout 6030-2 for mastery, 1369 neither [is it] the voice 6963 of [them that] cry 6030-2 for being overcome: 2476 [but] the noise 6963 of [them that] sing 6031-15 do I hear. 8085-6
32:19 And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh 7126-1 unto the camp, 4264 that he saw 7200-4 the calf, 5695 and the dancing: 4246 and Moses' 4872 anger 639 waxed hot, 2734-4 and he cast 7993-55 the tables 3871 out of his hands, 3027 and brake 7665-17 them beneath 8478 the mount. 2022
32:20 And he took 3947-4 the calf 5695 which they had made, 6213-1 and burnt 8313-4 [it] in the fire, 784 and ground 2912-4 [it] to powder, 1854-1 and strawed 2219-4 [it] upon 6440 the water, 4325 and made the children 1121 of Israel 3478 drink 8248-55 [of it].
32:21 And Moses 4872 said 559-4 unto Aaron, 175 What did 6213-1 this people 5971 unto thee, that thou hast brought 935-52 so great 1419 a sin 2401 upon them?
32:22 And Aaron 175 said, 559-4 Let not the anger 639 of my lord 113 wax hot: 2734-4 thou knowest 3045-1 the people, 5971 that they [are set] on mischief. 7451
32:23 For they said 559-4 unto me, Make 6213-3 us gods, 430 which shall go 3212-4 before 6440 us: for [as for] this Moses, 4872 the man 376 that brought us up 5927-52 out of the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 we wot 3045-1 not what is become of him.
32:24 And I said 559-4 unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, 2091 let them break [it] off. 6561-100 So they gave 5414-4 [it] me: then I cast 7993-55 it into the fire, 784 and there came out 3318-4 this calf. 5695
32:25 And when Moses 4872 saw 7200-4 that the people 5971 [were] naked; 6544-7 (for Aaron 175 had made them naked 6544-1 unto [their] shame 8103 among their enemies:) 6965-5
32:26 Then Moses 4872 stood 5975-4 in the gate 8179 of the camp, 4264 and said, 559-4 Who [is] on the LORD'S 3068 side? [let him come] unto me. And all the sons 1121 of Levi 3878 gathered 622-11 themselves together unto him.
32:27 And he said 559-4 unto them, Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel, 3478 Put 7760-3 every man 376 his sword 2719 by his side, 3409 [and] go 5674-3 in and out 7725-3 from gate 8179 to gate 8179 throughout the camp, 4264 and slay 2026-3 every man 376 his brother, 251 and every man 376 his companion, 7453 and every man 376 his neighbour. 7138
32:28 And the children 1121 of Levi 3878 did 6213-4 according to the word 1697 of Moses: 4872 and there fell 5307-4 of the people 5971 that day 3117 about three 7969 thousand 505 men. 376
32:29 For Moses 4872 had said, 559-4 Consecrate 3027 yourselves 4390-3 to day 3117 to the LORD, 3068 even 3588 every man 376 upon his son, 1121 and upon his brother; 251 that he may bestow 5414-2 upon you a blessing 1293 this day. 3117
32:30 And it came to pass on the morrow, 4283 that Moses 4872 said 559-4 unto the people, 5971 Ye have sinned 2398-1 a great 1419 sin: 2401 and now I will go up 5927-4 unto the LORD; 3068 peradventure 194 I shall make an atonement 3722-17 for 1157 your sin. 2403
32:31 And Moses 4872 returned 7725-4 unto the LORD, 3068 and said, 559-4 Oh, 577 this people 5971 have sinned 2398-1 a great 1419 sin, 2401 and have made 6213-4 them gods 430 of gold. 2091
32:32 Yet now, if thou wilt forgive 5375-4 their sin--; 2403 and if not, blot 4229-3 me, I pray thee, out of thy book 5612 which thou hast written. 3789-1
32:33 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Whosoever 834 hath sinned 2398-1 against me, him will I blot out 4229-4 of my book. 5612
32:34 Therefore now go, 3212-3 lead 5148-3 the people 5971 unto [the place] of which I have spoken 1696-14 unto thee: behold, mine Angel 4397 shall go 3212-4 before 6440 thee: nevertheless in the day 3117 when I visit 6485-2 I will visit 6485-1 their sin 2403 upon them.
32:35 And the LORD 3068 plagued 5062-4 the people, 5971 because 834 they made 6213-1 the calf, 5695 which Aaron 175 made. 6213-1
33:1 And the LORD 3068 said 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 Depart, 3212-3 [and] go up 5927-3 hence, thou and the people 5971 which thou hast brought up 5927-52 out of the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 unto the land 776 which I sware 7650-8 unto Abraham, 85 to Isaac, 3327 and to Jacob, 3290 saying, 559-2 Unto thy seed 2233 will I give 5414-4 it:
33:2 And I will send 7971-1 an angel 4397 before 6440 thee; and I will drive out 1644-14 the Canaanite, 3669 the Amorite, 567 and the Hittite, 2850 and the Perizzite, 6522 the Hivite, 2340 and the Jebusite: 2983
33:3 Unto a land 776 flowing 2100-6 with milk 2461 and honey: 1706 for I will not go up 5927-4 in the midst 7130 of thee; for thou [art] a stiffnecked 7186 6203 people: 5971 lest I consume 3615-17 thee in the way. 1870
33:4 And when the people 5971 heard 8085-4 these evil 7451 tidings, 1697 they mourned: 56-101 and no man 376 did put 7896-1 on him his ornaments. 5716
33:5 For the LORD 3068 had said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Say 559-3 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 Ye [are] a stiffnecked 7186 6203 people: 5971 I will come up 5927-4 into the midst 7130 of thee in a 259 moment, 7281 and consume 3615-14 thee: therefore now put off 3381-54 thy ornaments 5716 from thee, that I may know 3045-4 what to do 6213-4 unto thee.
33:6 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 stripped 5337-101 themselves of their ornaments 5716 by the mount 2022 Horeb. 2722
33:7 And Moses 4872 took 3947-4 the tabernacle, 168 and pitched 5186-1 it without 2351 the camp, 4264 afar off 7368-53 from the camp, 4264 and called 7121-1 it the Tabernacle 168 of the congregation. 4150 And it came to pass, [that] every one which sought 1245-18 the LORD 3068 went out 3318-4 unto the tabernacle 168 of the congregation, 4150 which [was] without 2351 the camp. 4264
33:8 And it came to pass, when Moses 4872 went out 3318-2 unto the tabernacle, 168 [that] all the people 5971 rose up, 6965-4 and stood 5324-8 every man 376 [at] his tent 168 door, 6607 and looked 5027-52 after 310 Moses, 4872 until he was gone 935-2 into the tabernacle. 168
33:9 And it came to pass, as Moses 4872 entered 935-2 into the tabernacle, 168 the cloudy 6051 pillar 5982 descended, 3381-4 and stood 5975-1 [at] the door 6607 of the tabernacle, 168 and [the LORD] talked 1696-14 with Moses. 4872
33:10 And all the people 5971 saw 7200-1 the cloudy 6051 pillar 5982 stand 5975-6 [at] the tabernacle 168 door: 6607 and all the people 5971 rose up 6965-1 and worshipped, 7812-98 every man 376 [in] his tent 168 door. 6607
33:11 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-14 unto Moses 4872 face 6440 to face, 6440 as a man 376 speaketh 1696-17 unto his friend. 7453 And he turned 7725-1 again into the camp: 4264 but his servant 8334-18 Joshua, 3091 the son 1121 of Nun, 5126 a young man, 5288 departed 4185-55 not out 8432 of the tabernacle. 168
33:12 And Moses 4872 said 559-4 unto the LORD, 3068 See, 7200-3 thou sayest 559-6 unto me, Bring up 5927-54 this people: 5971 and thou hast not let me know 3045-52 whom thou wilt send 7971-4 with me. Yet thou hast said, 559-1 I know 3045-1 thee by name, 8034 and thou hast also found 4672-1 grace 2580 in my sight. 5869
33:13 Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found 4672-1 grace 2580 in thy sight, 5869 shew 3045-54 me now thy way, 1870 that I may know 3045-4 thee, that I may find 4672-4 grace 2580 in thy sight: 5869 and consider 7200-3 that this nation 1471 [is] thy people. 5971
33:14 And he said, 559-4 My presence 6440 shall go 3212-4 [with thee], and I will give thee rest. 5117-52
33:15 And he said 559-4 unto him, If thy presence 6440 go 1980-6 not [with me], carry us not up 5927-55 hence.
33:16 For wherein shall it be known 3045-11 here 645 that I and thy people 5971 have found 4672-1 grace 2580 in thy sight? 5869 [is it] not in that thou goest 3212-2 with us? so shall we be separated, 6395-8 I and thy people, 5971 from all the people 5971 that [are] upon the face 6440 of the earth. 127
33:17 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 I will do 6213-4 this thing 1697 also that thou hast spoken: 1696-14 for thou hast found 4672-1 grace 2580 in my sight, 5869 and I know 3045-4 thee by name. 8034
33:18 And he said, 559-4 I beseech thee, 4994 shew 7200-54 me thy glory. 3519
33:19 And he said, 559-4 I will make all my goodness 2898 pass 5674-55 before 6440 thee, and I will proclaim 7121-1 the name 8034 of the LORD 3068 before 6440 thee; and will be gracious 2603-1 to whom I will be gracious, 2603-4 and will shew mercy 7355-14 on whom I will shew mercy. 7355-17
33:20 And he said, 559-4 Thou canst 3201-4 not see 7200-2 my face: 6440 for there shall no man 120 see 7200-4 me, and live. 2425-1
33:21 And the LORD 3068 said, 559-4 Behold, [there is] a place 4725 by me, and thou shalt stand 5324-8 upon a rock: 6697
33:22 And it shall come to pass, while my glory 3519 passeth by, 5674-2 that I will put 7760-1 thee in a clift 5366 of the rock, 6697 and will cover 5526-1 thee with my hand 3709 while 5704 I pass by: 5674-2
33:23 And I will take away 5493-52 mine hand, 3709 and thou shalt see 7200-1 my back parts: 268 but my face 6440 shall not be seen. 7200-11
34:1 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Hew 6458-3 thee two 8147 tables 3871 of stone 68 like unto the first: 7223 and I will write 3789-1 upon [these] tables 3871 the words 1697 that were in the first 7223 tables, 3871 which thou brakest. 7665-14
34:2 And be ready 3559-12 in the morning, 1242 and come up 5927-1 in the morning 1242 unto mount 2022 Sinai, 5514 and present 5324-8 thyself there to me in the top 7218 of the mount. 2022
34:3 And no man 376 shall come up 5927-4 with thee, neither 408 let any man 376 be seen 7200-11 throughout all the mount; 2022 neither 408 let the flocks 6629 nor herds 1241 feed 7462-4 before 4136 that mount. 2022
34:4 And he hewed 6458-4 two 8147 tables 3871 of stone 68 like unto the first; 7223 and Moses 4872 rose up early 7925-55 in the morning, 1242 and went up 5927-4 unto mount 2022 Sinai, 5514 as the LORD 3068 had commanded 6680-14 him, and took 3947-4 in his hand 3027 the two 8147 tables 3871 of stone. 68
34:5 And the LORD 3068 descended 3381-4 in the cloud, 6051 and stood 3320-101 with him there, and proclaimed 7121-4 the name 8034 of the LORD. 3068
34:6 And the LORD 3068 passed by 5674-4 before him, 6440 and proclaimed, 7121-4 The LORD, 3068 The LORD 3068 God, 410 merciful 7349 and gracious, 2587 longsuffering, 750 639 and abundant 7227 in goodness 2617 and truth, 571
34:7 Keeping 5341-6 mercy 2617 for thousands, 505 forgiving 5375-6 iniquity 5771 and transgression 6588 and sin, 2403 and that will by no means 5352-15 clear 5352-17 [the guilty]; visiting 6485-6 the iniquity 5771 of the fathers 1 upon the children, 1121 and upon the children's 1121 children, 1121 unto the third 8029 and to the fourth 7256 [generation].
34:8 And Moses 4872 made haste, 4116-17 and bowed his head 6915-4 toward the earth, 776 and worshipped. 7812-101
34:9 And he said, 559-4 If now I have found 4672-1 grace 2580 in thy sight, 5869 O Lord, 136 let my Lord, 136 I pray thee, go 3212-4 among 7130 us; for it [is] a stiffnecked 7186 6203 people; 5971 and pardon 5545-1 our iniquity 5771 and our sin, 2403 and take us for thine inheritance. 5157-1
34:10 And he said, 559-4 Behold, I make 3772-6 a covenant: 1285 before all thy people 5971 I will do 6213-4 marvels, 6381-12 such as have not been done 1254-8 in all the earth, 776 nor in any nation: 1471 and all the people 5971 among 7130 which thou [art] shall see 7200-1 the work 4639 of the LORD: 3068 for it [is] a terrible 3372-12 thing that I will do 6213-6 with thee.
34:11 Observe 8104-3 thou that which I command 6680-18 thee this day: 3117 behold, I drive out 1644-6 before 6440 thee the Amorite, 567 and the Canaanite, 3669 and the Hittite, 2850 and the Perizzite, 6522 and the Hivite, 2340 and the Jebusite. 2983
34:12 Take heed 8104-10 to thyself, lest thou make 3772-4 a covenant 1285 with the inhabitants 3427-6 of the land 776 whither thou goest, 935-6 lest it be for a snare 4170 in the midst 7130 of thee:
34:13 But ye shall destroy 5422-4 their altars, 4196 break 7665-17 their images, 4676 and cut down 3772-4 their groves: 842
34:14 For thou shalt worship 7812-101 no other 312 god: 410 for the LORD, 3068 whose name 8034 [is] Jealous, 7067 [is] a jealous 7067 God: 410
34:15 Lest thou make 3772-4 a covenant 1285 with the inhabitants 3427-6 of the land, 776 and they go a whoring 2181-1 after 310 their gods, 430 and do sacrifice 2076-1 unto their gods, 430 and [one] call 7121-1 thee, and thou eat 398-1 of his sacrifice; 2077
34:16 And thou take 3947-1 of their daughters 1323 unto thy sons, 1121 and their daughters 1323 go a whoring 2181-1 after 310 their gods, 430 and make thy sons 1121 go a whoring 2181-52 after 310 their gods. 430
34:17 Thou shalt make 6213-4 thee no molten 4541 gods. 430
34:18 The feast 2282 of unleavened bread 4682 shalt thou keep. 8104-4 Seven 7651 days 3117 thou shalt eat 398-4 unleavened bread, 4682 as I commanded 6680-14 thee, in the time 4150 of the month 2320 Abib: 24 for in the month 2320 Abib 24 thou camest out 3318-1 from Egypt. 4714
34:19 All that openeth 6363 the matrix 7358 [is] mine; and every firstling 6363 among thy cattle, 4735 [whether] ox 7794 or sheep, 7716 [that is male]. 2142-11
34:20 But the firstling 6363 of an ass 2543 thou shalt redeem 6299-4 with a lamb: 7716 and if thou redeem 6299-4 [him] not, then shalt thou break his neck. 6202-1 All the firstborn 1060 of thy sons 1121 thou shalt redeem. 6299-4 And none shall appear 7200-11 before 6440 me empty. 7387
34:21 Six 8337 days 3117 thou shalt work, 5647-4 but on the seventh 7637 day 3117 thou shalt rest: 7673-4 in earing time 2758 and in harvest 7105 thou shalt rest. 7673-4
34:22 And thou shalt observe 6213-4 the feast 2282 of weeks, 7620 of the firstfruits 1061 of wheat 2406 harvest, 7105 and the feast 2282 of ingathering 614 at the year's 8141 end. 8622
34:23 Thrice 6471 7969 in the year 8141 shall all your men children 2138 appear 7200-11 before 6440 the Lord 113 GOD, 3068 the God 430 of Israel. 3478
34:24 For I will cast out 3423-55 the nations 1471 before 6440 thee, and enlarge 7337-52 thy borders: 1366 neither shall any man 376 desire 2530-4 thy land, 776 when thou shalt go up 5927-2 to appear 7200-9 before 6440 the LORD 3068 thy God 430 thrice 6471 7969 in the year. 8141
34:25 Thou shalt not offer 7819-4 the blood 1818 of my sacrifice 2077 with leaven; 2557 neither shall the sacrifice 2077 of the feast 2282 of the passover 6453 be left 3885-4 unto the morning. 1242
34:26 The first 7225 of the firstfruits 1061 of thy land 127 thou shalt bring 935-55 unto the house 1004 of the LORD 3068 thy God. 430 Thou shalt not seethe 1310-17 a kid 1423 in his mother's 517 milk. 2461
34:27 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Write 3789-3 thou these words: 1697 for after the tenor 6310 of these words 1697 I have made 3772-1 a covenant 1285 with thee and with Israel. 3478
34:28 And he was there with the LORD 3068 forty 705 days 3117 and forty 705 nights; 3915 he did neither eat 398-1 bread, 3899 nor drink 8354-1 water. 4325 And he wrote 3789-4 upon the tables 3871 the words 1697 of the covenant, 1285 the ten 6235 commandments. 1697
34:29 And it came to pass, when Moses 4872 came down 3381-2 from mount 2022 Sinai 5514 with the two 8147 tables 3871 of testimony 5715 in Moses' 4872 hand, 3027 when he came down 3381-2 from the mount, 2022 that Moses 4872 wist 3045-1 not that the skin 5785 of his face 6440 shone 7160-1 while he talked 1696-15 with him.
34:30 And when Aaron 175 and all the children 1121 of Israel 3478 saw 7200-4 Moses, 4872 behold, the skin 5785 of his face 6440 shone; 7160-1 and they were afraid 3372-4 to come nigh 5066-2 him.
34:31 And Moses 4872 called 7121-4 unto them; and Aaron 175 and all the rulers 5387 of the congregation 5712 returned 7725-4 unto him: and Moses 4872 talked 1696-17 with them.
34:32 And afterward 310 all the children 1121 of Israel 3478 came nigh: 5066-8 and he gave them in commandment 6680-17 all that the LORD 3068 had spoken 1696-14 with him in mount 2022 Sinai. 5514
34:33 And [till] Moses 4872 had done 3615-17 speaking 1696-15 with them, he put 5414-4 a vail 4533 on his face. 6440
34:34 But when Moses 4872 went in 935-2 before 6440 the LORD 3068 to speak 1696-15 with him, he took the vail 4533 off, 5493-55 until he came out. 3318-2 And he came out, 3318-1 and spake 1696-14 unto the children 1121 of Israel 3478 [that] which he was commanded. 6680-29
34:35 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 saw 7200-1 the face 6440 of Moses, 4872 that the skin 5785 of Moses' 4872 face 6440 shone: 7160-1 and Moses 4872 put the vail 4533 upon his face 6440 again, 7725-52 until he went in 935-2 to speak 1696-15 with him.
35:1 And Moses 4872 gathered all the congregation 5712 of the children 1121 of Israel 3478 together, 6950-55 and said 559-4 unto them, These [are] the words 1697 which the LORD 3068 hath commanded, 6680-14 that [ye] should do 6213-2 them.
35:2 Six 8337 days 3117 shall work 4399 be done, 6213-11 but on the seventh 7637 day 3117 there shall be to you an holy 6944 day, a sabbath 7676 of rest 7677 to the LORD: 3068 whosoever doeth 6213-6 work 4399 therein shall be put to death. 4191-93
35:3 Ye shall kindle 1197-17 no fire 784 throughout your habitations 4186 upon the sabbath 7676 day. 3117
35:4 And Moses 4872 spake 559-4 unto all the congregation 5712 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 saying, 559-2 This [is] the thing 1697 which the LORD 3068 commanded, 6680-14 saying, 559-2
35:5 Take 3947-3 ye from among you an offering 8641 unto the LORD: 3068 whosoever 3605 [is] of a willing 5081 heart, 3820 let him bring 935-55 it, an offering 8641 of the LORD; 3068 gold, 2091 and silver, 3701 and brass, 5178

35:9 And onyx 7718 stones, 68 and stones 68 to be set 4394 for the ephod, 646 and for the breastplate. 2833
35:10 And every wise 2450 hearted 3820 among you shall come, 935-4 and make 6213-4 all that the LORD 3068 hath commanded; 6680-14
35:11 The tabernacle, 4908 his tent, 168 and his covering, 4372 his taches, 7165 and his boards, 7175 his bars, 1280 his pillars, 5982 and his sockets, 134

35:20 And all the congregation 5712 of the children 1121 of Israel 3478 departed 3318-4 from the presence 6440 of Moses. 4872
35:21 And they came, 935-4 every one 376 whose heart 3820 stirred him up, 5375-1 and every one whom 834 his spirit 7307 made willing, 5068-1 [and] they brought 935-52 the LORD'S 3068 offering 8641 to the work 4399 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation, 4150 and for all his service, 5656 and for the holy 6944 garments. 899
35:22 And they came, 935-4 both 5921 men 582 and women, 802 as many as 3605 were willing 5081 hearted, 3820 [and] brought 935-52 bracelets, 2397 and earrings, 5141 and rings, 2885 and tablets, 3558 all jewels 3627 of gold: 2091 and every man 376 that offered 5130-52 [offered] an offering 8573 of gold 2091 unto the LORD. 3068

35:29 The children 1121 of Israel 3478 brought 935-52 a willing offering 5071 unto the LORD, 3068 every man 376 and woman, 802 whose 834 heart 3820 made them willing 5068-1 to bring 935-53 for all manner of work, 4399 which the LORD 3068 had commanded 6680-14 to be made 6213-2 by the hand 3027 of Moses. 4872
35:30 And Moses 4872 said 559-4 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 See, 7200-3 the LORD 3068 hath called 7121-1 by name 8034 Bezaleel 1212 the son 1121 of Uri, 221 the son 1121 of Hur, 2354 of the tribe 4294 of Judah; 3063
35:31 And he hath filled 4390-17 him with the spirit 7307 of God, 430 in wisdom, 2451 in understanding, 8394 and in knowledge, 1847 and in all manner of workmanship; 4399
35:32 And to devise 2803-2 curious works, 4284 to work 6213-2 in gold, 2091 and in silver, 3701 and in brass, 5178
35:33 And in the cutting 2799 of stones, 68 to set 4390-15 [them], and in carving 2799 of wood, 6086 to make 6213-2 any manner of cunning 4284 work. 4399
35:34 And he hath put 5414-1 in his heart 3820 that he may teach, 3384-53 [both] he, and Aholiab, 171 the son 1121 of Ahisamach, 294 of the tribe 4294 of Dan. 1835
35:35 Them hath he filled 4390-14 with wisdom 2451 of heart, 3820 to work 6213-2 all manner of 3605 work, 4399 of the engraver, 2796 and of the cunning workman, 2803-6 and of the embroiderer, 7551-6 in blue, 8504 and in purple, 713 in scarlet, 8144 8438 and in fine linen, 8336 and of the weaver, 707-6 [even] of them that do 6213-6 any work, 4399 and of those that devise 2803-6 cunning work. 4284
36:1 Then wrought 6213-1 Bezaleel 1212 and Aholiab, 171 and every wise 2450 hearted 3820 man, 376 in whom 1992 the LORD 3068 put 5414-1 wisdom 2451 and understanding 8394 to know 3045-2 how to work 6213-2 all manner of work 4399 for the service 5656 of the sanctuary, 6944 according to all that the LORD 3068 had commanded. 6680-14
36:2 And Moses 4872 called 7121-4 Bezaleel 1212 and Aholiab, 171 and every wise 2450 hearted 3820 man, 376 in whose heart 3820 the LORD 3068 had put 5414-1 wisdom, 2451 [even] every one whose heart 3820 stirred him up 5375-1 to come 7126-2 unto the work 4399 to do 6213-2 it:
36:3 And they received 3947-4 of 6440 Moses 4872 all the offering, 8641 which the children 1121 of Israel 3478 had brought 935-52 for the work 4399 of the service 5656 of the sanctuary, 6944 to make 6213-2 it [withal]. And they brought 935-52 yet unto him free offerings 5071 every morning. 1242 1242
36:4 And all the wise men, 2450 that wrought 6213-6 all the work 4399 of the sanctuary, 6944 came 935-4 every man 376 from his work 4399 which they made; 6213-6
36:5 And they spake 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2 The people 5971 bring 935-53 much more 7235-56 than enough 1767 for the service 5656 of the work, 4399 which the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 to make. 6213-2
36:6 And Moses 4872 gave commandment, 6680-17 and they caused it to be proclaimed 6963 5674-55 throughout the camp, 4264 saying, 559-2 Let neither man 376 nor woman 802 make 6213-4 any more work 4399 for the offering 8641 of the sanctuary. 6944 So the people 5971 were restrained 3607-11 from bringing. 935-53
36:7 For the stuff 4399 they had was sufficient 1767 for all the work 4399 to make 6213-2 it, and too much. 3498-53
36:8 And every wise 2450 hearted 3820 man among them that wrought 6213-6 the work 4399 of the tabernacle 4908 made 6213-4 ten 6235 curtains 3407 [of] fine twined 7806-94 linen, 8336 and blue, 8504 and purple, 713 and scarlet: 8144 8438 [with] cherubims 3742 of cunning 2803-6 work 4639 made 6213-1 he them.
36:9 The length 753 of one 259 curtain 3407 [was] twenty 6242 and eight 8083 cubits, 520 and the breadth 7341 of one 259 curtain 3407 four 702 cubits: 520 the curtains 3407 [were] all of one 259 size. 4060
36:10 And he coupled 2266-17 the five 2568 curtains 3407 one 259 unto another: 259 and [the other] five 2568 curtains 3407 he coupled 2266-14 one 259 unto another. 259
36:11 And he made 6213-4 loops 3924 of blue 8504 on the edge 8193 of one 259 curtain 3407 from the selvedge 7098 in the coupling: 4225 likewise he made 6213-1 in the uttermost 7020 side 8193 of [another] curtain, 3407 in the coupling 4225 of the second. 8145
36:12 Fifty 2572 loops 3924 made 6213-1 he in one 259 curtain, 3407 and fifty 2572 loops 3924 made 6213-1 he in the edge 7097 of the curtain 3407 which [was] in the coupling 4225 of the second: 8145 the loops 3924 held 6901-56 one 259 [curtain] to another. 259
36:13 And he made 6213-4 fifty 2572 taches 7165 of gold, 2091 and coupled 2266-17 the curtains 3407 one 259 unto another 259 with the taches: 7165 so it became one 259 tabernacle. 4908
36:14 And he made 6213-4 curtains 3407 [of] goats' 5795 [hair] for the tent 168 over the tabernacle: 4908 eleven 6249 6240 curtains 3407 he made 6213-1 them.
36:15 The length 753 of one 259 curtain 3407 [was] thirty 7970 cubits, 520 and four 702 cubits 520 [was] the breadth 7341 of one 259 curtain: 3407 the eleven 6249 6240 curtains 3407 [were] of one 259 size. 4060
36:16 And he coupled 2266-17 five 2568 curtains 3407 by themselves, and six 8337 curtains 3407 by themselves.
36:17 And he made 6213-4 fifty 2572 loops 3924 upon the uttermost 7020 edge 8193 of the curtain 3407 in the coupling, 4225 and fifty 2572 loops 3924 made 6213-1 he upon the edge 8193 of the curtain 3407 which coupleth 2279 the second. 8145
36:18 And he made 6213-4 fifty 2572 taches 7165 [of] brass 5178 to couple 2266-15 the tent 168 together, that it might be one. 259
36:19 And he made 6213-4 a covering 4372 for the tent 168 [of] rams' 352 skins 5785 dyed red, 119-30 and a covering 4372 [of] badgers' 8476 skins 5785 above 4605 [that].
36:20 And he made 6213-4 boards 7175 for the tabernacle 4908 [of] shittim 7848 wood, 6086 standing up. 5975-6
36:21 The length 753 of a board 7175 [was] ten 6235 cubits, 520 and the breadth 7341 of a 259 board 7175 one cubit 520 and a half. 2677
36:22 One 259 board 7175 had two 8147 tenons, 3027 equally distant 7947-30 one 259 from 413 another: 259 thus did he make 6213-1 for all the boards 7175 of the tabernacle. 4908
36:23 And he made 6213-4 boards 7175 for the tabernacle; 4908 twenty 6242 boards 7175 for the south 5045 side 6285 southward: 8486
36:24 And forty 705 sockets 134 of silver 3701 he made 6213-1 under the twenty 6242 boards; 7175 two 8147 sockets 134 under one 259 board 7175 for his two 8147 tenons, 3027 and two 8147 sockets 134 under another 259 board 7175 for his two 8147 tenons. 3027
36:25 And for the other 8145 side 6763 of the tabernacle, 4908 [which is] toward the north 6828 corner, 6285 he made 6213-1 twenty 6242 boards, 7175
36:26 And their forty 705 sockets 134 of silver; 3701 two 8147 sockets 134 under one 259 board, 7175 and two 8147 sockets 134 under another 259 board. 7175
36:27 And for the sides 3411 of the tabernacle 4908 westward 3220 he made 6213-1 six 8337 boards. 7175
36:28 And two 8147 boards 7175 made 6213-1 he for the corners 4742 of the tabernacle 4908 in the two sides. 3411

39:15 And they made 6213-4 upon the breastplate 2833 chains 8333 at the ends, 1383 [of] wreathen 5688 work 4639 [of] pure 2889 gold. 2091
39:16 And they made 6213-4 two 8147 ouches 4865 [of] gold, 2091 and two 8147 gold 2091 rings; 2885 and put 5414-4 the two 8147 rings 2885 in the two 8147 ends 7098 of the breastplate. 2833
39:17 And they put 5414-4 the two 8147 wreathen chains 5688 of gold 2091 in the two 8147 rings 2885 on the ends 7098 of the breastplate. 2833
39:18 And the two 8147 ends 7098 of the two 8147 wreathen chains 5688 they fastened 5414-1 in the two 8147 ouches, 4865 and put 5414-4 them on the shoulderpieces 3802 of the ephod, 646 before 4136 it. 6440
39:19 And they made 6213-4 two 8147 rings 2885 of gold, 2091 and put 7760-4 [them] on the two 8147 ends 7098 of the breastplate, 2833 upon the border 8193 of it, which [was] on the side 5676 of the ephod 646 inward. 1004
39:20 And they made 6213-4 two 8147 [other] golden 2091 rings, 2885 and put 5414-4 them on the two 8147 sides 3802 of the ephod 646 underneath, 4295 toward 4136 the forepart 6440 of it, over against 5980 the [other] coupling 4225 thereof, above 4605 the curious girdle 2805 of the ephod. 646
39:21 And they did bind 7405-4 the breastplate 2833 by his rings 2885 unto the rings 2885 of the ephod 646 with a lace 6616 of blue, 8504 that it might be above the curious girdle 2805 of the ephod, 646 and that the breastplate 2833 might not be loosed 2118-11 from the ephod; 646 as the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses. 4872
39:22 And he made 6213-4 the robe 4598 of the ephod 646 [of] woven 707-6 work, 4639 all 3632 [of] blue. 8504
39:23 And [there was] an hole 6310 in the midst 8432 of the robe, 4598 as the hole 6310 of an habergeon, 8473 [with] a band 8193 round about 5439 the hole, 6310 that it should not rend. 7167-11
39:24 And they made 6213-4 upon the hems 7757 of the robe 4598 pomegranates 7416 [of] blue, 8504 and purple, 713 and scarlet, 8144 8438 [and] twined 7806-94 [linen].
39:25 And they made 6213-4 bells 6472 [of] pure 2889 gold, 2091 and put 5414-4 the bells 6472 between 8432 the pomegranates 7416 upon the hem 7757 of the robe, 4598 round about 5439 between 8432 the pomegranates; 7416
39:26 A bell 6472 and a pomegranate, 7416 a bell 6472 and a pomegranate, 7416 round about 5439 the hem 7757 of the robe 4598 to minister 8334-15 [in]; as the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses. 4872
39:27 And they made 6213-4 coats 3801 [of] fine linen 8336 [of] woven 707-6 work 4639 for Aaron, 175 and for his sons, 1121
39:28 And a mitre 4701 [of] fine linen, 8336 and goodly 6287 bonnets 4021 [of] fine linen, 8336 and linen 906 breeches 4370 [of] fine twined 7806-94 linen, 8336
39:29 And a girdle 73 [of] fine twined 7806-94 linen, 8336 and blue, 8504 and purple, 713 and scarlet, 8144 8438 [of] needlework; 7551-6 4639 as the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses. 4872
39:30 And they made 6213-4 the plate 6731 of the holy 6944 crown 5145 [of] pure 2889 gold, 2091 and wrote 3789-4 upon it a writing, 4385 [like to] the engravings 6603 of a signet, 2368 HOLINESS 6944 TO THE LORD. 3068
39:31 And they tied 5414-4 unto it a lace 6616 of blue, 8504 to fasten 5414-2 [it] on high 4605 upon the mitre; 4701 as the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses. 4872
39:32 Thus was all the work 5656 of the tabernacle 4908 of the tent 168 of the congregation 4150 finished: 3615-4 and the children 1121 of Israel 3478 did 6213-4 according to all that the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses, 4872 so did 6213-1 they.
39:33 And they brought 935-55 the tabernacle 4908 unto Moses, 4872 the tent, 168 and all his furniture, 3627 his taches, 7165 his boards, 7175 his bars, 1280 and his pillars, 5982 and his sockets, 134
39:34 And the covering 4372 of rams' 352 skins 5785 dyed red, 119-30 and the covering 4372 of badgers' 8476 skins, 5785 and the vail 6532 of the covering, 4539

39:37 The pure 2889 candlestick, 4501 [with] the lamps 5216 thereof, [even with] the lamps 5216 to be set in order, 4634 and all the vessels 3627 thereof, and the oil 8081 for light, 3974
39:38 And the golden 2091 altar, 4196 and the anointing 4888 oil, 8081 and the sweet 5561 incense, 7004 and the hanging 4539 for the tabernacle 168 door, 6607
39:39 The brasen 5178 altar, 4196 and his grate 4345 of brass, 5178 his staves, 905 and all his vessels, 3627 the laver 3595 and his foot, 3653
39:40 The hangings 7050 of the court, 2691 his pillars, 5982 and his sockets, 134 and the hanging 4539 for the court 2691 gate, 8179 his cords, 4340 and his pins, 3489 and all the vessels 3627 of the service 5656 of the tabernacle, 4908 for the tent 168 of the congregation, 4150
39:41 The cloths 899 of service 8278 to do service 8334-15 in the holy 6944 [place], and the holy 6944 garments 899 for Aaron 175 the priest, 3548 and his sons' 1121 garments, 899 to minister in the priest's office. 3547-15
39:42 According to all that the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses, 4872 so the children 1121 of Israel 3478 made 6213-1 all the work. 5656
39:43 And Moses 4872 did look 7200-4 upon all the work, 4399 and, behold, they had done 6213-1 it as the LORD 3068 had commanded, 6680-14 even so 3651 had they done 6213-1 it: and Moses 4872 blessed 1288-17 them.
40:1 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2
40:2 On the first 259 day 3117 of the first 7223 month 2320 2320 shalt thou set up 6965-55 the tabernacle 4908 of the tent 168 of the congregation. 4150
40:3 And thou shalt put 7760-1 therein 8033 the ark 727 of the testimony, 5715 and cover 5526-1 the ark 727 with the vail. 6532
40:4 And thou shalt bring in 935-52 the table, 7979 and set in order 6186-1 the things that are to be set in order 6187 upon it; and thou shalt bring in 935-52 the candlestick, 4501 and light 5927-52 the lamps 5216 thereof.
40:5 And thou shalt set 5414-1 the altar 4196 of gold 2091 for the incense 7004 before 6440 the ark 727 of the testimony, 5715 and put 7760-1 the hanging 4539 of the door 6607 to the tabernacle. 4908
40:6 And thou shalt set 5414-1 the altar 4196 of the burnt offering 5930 before 6440 the door 6607 of the tabernacle 4908 of the tent 168 of the congregation. 4150
40:7 And thou shalt set 5414-1 the laver 3595 between the tent 168 of the congregation 4150 and the altar, 4196 and shalt put 5414-1 water 4325 therein.
40:8 And thou shalt set up 7760-1 the court 2691 round about, 5439 and hang up 5414-1 the hanging 4539 at the court 2691 gate. 8179
40:9 And thou shalt take 3947-1 the anointing 4888 oil, 8081 and anoint 4886-1 the tabernacle, 4908 and all that [is] therein, and shalt hallow 6942-14 it, and all the vessels 3627 thereof: and it shall be holy. 6944
40:10 And thou shalt anoint 4886-1 the altar 4196 of the burnt offering, 5930 and all his vessels, 3627 and sanctify 6942-14 the altar: 4196 and it shall be an altar 4196 most 6944 holy. 6944
40:11 And thou shalt anoint 4886-1 the laver 3595 and his foot, 3653 and sanctify 6942-14 it.
40:12 And thou shalt bring 7126-52 Aaron 175 and his sons 1121 unto the door 6607 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation, 4150 and wash 7364-1 them with water. 4325
40:13 And thou shalt put 3847-52 upon Aaron 175 the holy 6944 garments, 899 and anoint 4886-1 him, and sanctify 6942-14 him; that he may minister unto me in the priest's office. 3547-14
40:14 And thou shalt bring 7126-55 his sons, 1121 and clothe 3847-52 them with coats: 3801
40:15 And thou shalt anoint 4886-1 them, as thou didst anoint 4886-1 their father, 1 that they may minister unto me in the priest's office: 3547-14 for their anointing 4888 shall surely be an everlasting 5769 priesthood 3550 throughout their generations. 1755
40:16 Thus did 6213-4 Moses: 4872 according to all that the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 him, so did 6213-1 he.
40:17 And it came to pass in the first 7223 month 2320 in the second 8145 year, 8141 on the first 259 [day] of the month, 2320 [that] the tabernacle 4908 was reared up. 6965-90
40:18 And Moses 4872 reared up 6965-55 the tabernacle, 4908 and fastened 5414-4 his sockets, 134 and set up 7760-4 the boards 7175 thereof, and put 5414-4 in the bars 1280 thereof, and reared up 6965-55 his pillars. 5982
40:19 And he spread abroad 6566-4 the tent 168 over the tabernacle, 4908 and put 7760-4 the covering 4372 of the tent 168 above 4605 upon it; as the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses. 4872
40:20 And he took 3947-4 and put 5414-4 the testimony 5715 into the ark, 727 and set 7760-4 the staves 905 on the ark, 727 and put 5414-4 the mercy seat 3727 above 4605 upon the ark: 727
40:21 And he brought 935-55 the ark 727 into the tabernacle, 4908 and set up 7760-4 the vail 6532 of the covering, 4539 and covered 5526-55 the ark 727 of the testimony; 5715 as the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses. 4872
40:22 And he put 5414-4 the table 7979 in the tent 168 of the congregation, 4150 upon the side 3409 of the tabernacle 4908 northward, 6828 without 2351 the vail. 6532
40:23 And he set 6187 the bread 3899 in order 6186-4 upon it before 6440 the LORD; 3068 as the LORD 3068 had commanded 6680-14 Moses. 4872
40:24 And he put 7760-4 the candlestick 4501 in the tent 168 of the congregation, 4150 over against 5227 the table, 7979 on the side 3409 of the tabernacle 4908 southward. 5045
40:25 And he lighted 5927-55 the lamps 5216 before 6440 the LORD; 3068 as the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses. 4872
40:26 And he put 7760-4 the golden 2091 altar 4196 in the tent 168 of the congregation 4150 before 6440 the vail: 6532
40:27 And he burnt 6999-55 sweet 5561 incense 7004 thereon; as the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses. 4872
40:28 And he set up 7760-4 the hanging 4539 [at] the door 6607 of the tabernacle. 4908
40:29 And he put 7760-1 the altar 4196 of burnt offering 5930 [by] the door 6607 of the tabernacle 4908 of the tent 168 of the congregation, 4150 and offered 5927-55 upon it the burnt offering 5930 and the meat offering; 4503 as the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses. 4872
40:30 And he set 7760-4 the laver 3595 between the tent 168 of the congregation 4150 and the altar, 4196 and put 5414-4 water 4325 there, to wash 7364-2 [withal].
40:31 And Moses 4872 and Aaron 175 and his sons 1121 washed 7364-1 their hands 3027 and their feet 7272 thereat:
40:32 When they went 935-2 into the tent 168 of the congregation, 4150 and when they came near 7126-2 unto the altar, 4196 they washed; 7364-4 as the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses. 4872
40:33 And he reared up 6965-55 the court 2691 round about 5439 the tabernacle 4908 and the altar, 4196 and set 5414-4 up the hanging 4539 of the court 2691 gate. 8179 So Moses 4872 finished 3615-17 the work. 4399
40:34 Then a cloud 6051 covered 3680-17 the tent 168 of the congregation, 4150 and the glory 3519 of the LORD 3068 filled 4390-1 the tabernacle. 4908
40:35 And Moses 4872 was not able 3201-1 to enter 935-2 into the tent 168 of the congregation, 4150 because the cloud 6051 abode 7931-1 thereon, and the glory 3519 of the LORD 3068 filled 4390-1 the tabernacle. 4908
40:36 And when the cloud 6051 was taken up 5927-9 from over 5921 the tabernacle, 4908 the children 1121 of Israel 3478 went onward 5265-4 in all their journeys: 4550
40:37 But if the cloud 6051 were not taken up, 5927-11 then they journeyed 5265-4 not till the day 3117 that it was taken up. 5927-9
40:38 For the cloud 6051 of the LORD 3068 [was] upon the tabernacle 4908 by day, 3119 and fire 784 was on it by night, 3915 in the sight 5869 of all the house 1004 of Israel, 3478 throughout all their journeys. 4550
