1:1 In the beginning 7225 God 430 created 1254-1 853 the heaven 8064 and 853 the earth. 776
1:2 And the earth 776 was 1961-1 without form, 8414 and void; 922 and darkness 2822 [was] upon the face 6440 of the deep. 8415 And the Spirit 7307 of God 430 moved 7363-18 upon 5921 the face 6440 of the waters. 4325
1:3 And God 430 said, 559-4 Let there be 1961-4 light: 216 and there was 1961-4 light. 216
1:4 And God 430 saw 7200-4 853 the light, 216 that 3588 [it was] good: 2896 and God 430 divided 914-55 996 the light 216 from 996 the darkness. 2822
1:5 And God 430 called 7121-4 the light 216 Day, 3117 and the darkness 2822 he called 7121-1 Night. 3915 And the evening 6153 and the morning 1242 were the first 259 day. 3117
1:6 And God 430 said, 559-4 Let there be a firmament 7549 in the midst 8432 of the waters, 4325 and let it divide 914-56 the waters 4325 from the waters. 4325
1:7 And God 430 made 6213-4 the firmament, 7549 and divided 914-55 the waters 4325 which 834 [were] under 8478 the firmament 7549 from the waters 4325 which 834 [were] above 5921 the firmament: 7549 and it was so. 3651
1:8 And God 430 called 7121-4 the firmament 7549 Heaven. 8064 And the evening 6153 and the morning 1242 were the second 8145 day. 3117
1:9 And God 430 said, 559-4 Let the waters 4325 under the heaven 8064 be gathered together 6960-11 unto 413 one 259 place, 4725 and let the dry 3004 [land] appear: 7200-11 and it was so.
1:10 And God 430 called 7121-4 the dry 3004 [land] Earth; 776 and the gathering together 4723 of the waters 4325 called 7121-1 he Seas: 3220 and God 430 saw 7200-4 that [it was] good. 2896
1:11 And God 430 said, 559-4 Let the earth 776 bring forth 1876-55 grass, 1877 the herb 6212 yielding 2232-56 seed, 2233 [and] the fruit 6529 tree 6086 yielding 6213-6 fruit 6529 after his kind, 4327 whose 834 seed 2233 [is] in itself, upon the earth: 776 and it was so.
1:12 And the earth 776 brought forth 3318-55 grass, 1877 [and] herb 6212 yielding 2232-56 seed 2233 after his kind, 4327 and the tree 6086 yielding 6213-6 fruit, 6529 whose seed 2233 [was] in itself, after his kind: 4327 and God 430 saw 7200-4 that [it was] good. 2896
1:13 And the evening 6153 and the morning 1242 were the third 7992 day. 3117
1:14 And God 430 said, 559-4 Let there be lights 3974 in the firmament 7549 of the heaven 8064 to divide 914-53 the day 3117 from the night; 3915 and let them be for signs, 226 and for seasons, 4150 and for days, 3117 and years: 8141
1:15 And let them be for lights 3974 in the firmament 7549 of the heaven 8064 to give light 215-53 upon the earth: 776 and it was so.
1:16 And God 430 made 6213-4 two 8147 great 1419 lights; 3974 the greater 1419 light 3974 to rule 4475 the day, 3117 and the lesser 6996 light 3974 to rule 4475 the night: 3915 [he made] the stars 3556 also.
1:17 And God 430 set 5414-4 them in the firmament 7549 of the heaven 8064 to give light 215-53 upon the earth, 776
1:18 And to rule 4910-2 over the day 3117 and over the night, 3915 and to divide 914-53 the light 216 from the darkness: 2822 and God 430 saw 7200-4 that [it was] good. 2896
1:19 And the evening 6153 and the morning 1242 were the fourth 7243 day. 3117
1:20 And God 430 said, 559-4 Let the waters 4325 bring forth abundantly 8317-4 the moving creature 8318 that hath 5315 life, 2416 and fowl 5775 [that] may fly 5774-34 above 5921 the earth 776 in the open 6440 firmament 7549 of heaven. 8064
1:21 And God 430 created 1254-4 great 1419 whales, 8577 and every living 2416 creature 5315 that moveth, 7430-6 which the waters 4325 brought forth abundantly, 8317-1 after their kind, 4327 and every winged 3671 fowl 5775 after his kind: 4327 and God 430 saw 7200-4 that [it was] good. 2896
1:22 And God 430 blessed 1288-17 them, saying, 559-2 Be fruitful, 6509-3 and multiply, 7235-3 and fill 4390-3 the waters 4325 in the seas, 3220 and let fowl 5775 multiply 7235-4 in the earth. 776
1:23 And the evening 6153 and the morning 1242 were the fifth 2549 day. 3117
1:24 And God 430 said, 559-4 Let the earth 776 bring forth 3318-55 the living 2416 creature 5315 after his kind, 4327 cattle, 929 and creeping thing, 7431 and beast 2416 of the earth 776 after his kind: 4327 and it was so.
1:25 And God 430 made 6213-4 the beast 2416 of the earth 776 after his kind, 4327 and cattle 929 after their kind, 4327 and every thing that creepeth 7431 upon the earth 127 after his kind: 4327 and God 430 saw 7200-4 that [it was] good. 2896
1:26 And God 430 said, 559-4 Let us make 6213-4 man 120 in our image, 6754 after our likeness: 1823 and let them have dominion 7287-4 over the fish 1710 of the sea, 3220 and over the fowl 5775 of the air, 8064 and over the cattle, 929 and over all the earth, 776 and over every creeping thing 7431 that creepeth 7430-6 upon the earth. 776
1:27 So God 430 created 1254-4 man 120 in his [own] image, 6754 in the image 6754 of God 430 created 1254-1 he him; male 2145 and female 5347 created 1254-1 he them.
1:28 And God 430 blessed 1288-17 them, and God 430 said 559-4 unto them, Be fruitful, 6509-3 and multiply, 7235-3 and replenish 4390-3 the earth, 776 and subdue it: 3533-3 and have dominion 7287-3 over the fish 1710 of the sea, 3220 and over the fowl 5775 of the air, 8064 and over every living thing 2416 that moveth 7430-6 upon the earth. 776
1:29 And God 430 said, 559-4 Behold, 2009 I have given 5414-1 you every herb 6212 bearing 2232-6 seed, 2233 which [is] upon the face 6440 of all the earth, 776 and every tree, 6086 in the which [is] the fruit 6529 of a tree 6086 yielding 2232-6 seed; 2233 to you it shall be 1961-4 for meat. 402
1:30 And to every beast 2416 of the earth, 776 and to every fowl 5775 of the air, 8064 and to every thing that creepeth 7430-6 upon the earth, 776 wherein [there is] life, 2416 5315 [I have given] every green 3418 herb 6212 for meat: 402 and it was so.
1:31 And God 430 saw 7200-4 every thing that 834 he had made, 6213-1 and, behold, [it was] very 3966 good. 2896 And the evening 6153 and the morning 1242 were the sixth 8345 day. 3117
2:1 Thus the heavens 8064 and the earth 776 were finished, 3615-29 and all the host 6635 of them.
2:2 And on the seventh 7637 day 3117 God 430 ended 3615-17 his work 4399 which he had made; 6213-1 and he rested 7673-4 on the seventh 7637 day 3117 from all his work 4399 which he had made. 6213-1
2:3 And God 430 blessed 1288-17 the seventh 7637 day, 3117 and sanctified 6942-17 it: because that 3588 in it he had rested 7673-1 from all his work 4399 which God 430 created 1254-1 and made. 6213-2
2:4 These 428 [are] the generations 8435 of the heavens 8064 and of the earth 776 when they were created, 1254-9 in the day 3117 that the LORD 3068 God 430 made 6213-2 the earth 776 and the heavens, 8064
2:5 And every plant 7880 of the field 7704 before 2962 it was in the earth, 776 and every herb 6212 of the field 7704 before 2962 it grew: 6779-4 for 3588 the LORD 3068 God 430 had not 3808 caused it to rain 4305-52 upon the earth, 776 and [there was] not 369 a man 120 to till 5647-2 the ground. 127
2:6 But there went up 5927-4 a mist 108 from 4480 the earth, 776 and watered 8248-52 the whole face 6440 of the ground. 127
2:7 And the LORD 3068 God 430 formed 3335-4 man 120 [of] the dust 6083 of 4480 the ground, 127 and breathed 5301-4 into his nostrils 639 the breath 5397 of life; 2416 and man 120 became a living 2416 soul. 5315
2:8 And the LORD 3068 God 430 planted 5193-4 a garden 1588 eastward 6924 in Eden; 5731 and there 8033 he put 7760-4 the man 120 whom 834 he had formed. 3335-1
2:9 And out of 4480 the ground 127 made the LORD 3068 God 430 to grow 6779-55 every tree 6086 that is pleasant 2530-12 to the sight, 4758 and good 2896 for food; 3978 the tree 6086 of life 2416 also in the midst 8432 of the garden, 1588 and the tree 6086 of knowledge 1847 of good 2896 and evil. 7451
2:10 And a river 5104 went out 3318-6 of Eden 5731 to water 8248-53 the garden; 1588 and from thence it was parted, 6504-11 and became into four 702 heads. 7218
2:11 The name 8034 of the first 259 [is] Pison: 6376 that 1931 [is] it which compasseth 5437-6 the whole land 776 of Havilah, 2341 where 834 [there is] gold; 2091
2:12 And the gold 2091 of that 1931 land 776 [is] good: 2896 there [is] bdellium 916 and the onyx 7718 stone. 68
2:13 And the name 8034 of the second 8145 river 5104 [is] Gihon: 1521 the same [is] it that compasseth 5437-6 the whole land 776 of Ethiopia. 3568
2:14 And the name 8034 of the third 7992 river 5104 [is] Hiddekel: 2313 that [is] it which goeth 1980-6 toward the east 6926 of Assyria. 804 And the fourth 7243 river 5104 [is] Euphrates. 6578
2:15 And the LORD 3068 God 430 took 3947-4 the man, 120 and put 3240-55 him into the garden 1588 of Eden 5731 to dress 5647-2 it and to keep 8104-2 it.
2:16 And the LORD 3068 God 430 commanded 6680-17 the man, 120 saying, 559-2 Of every tree 6086 of the garden 1588 thou mayest freely 398-2 eat: 398-4
2:17 But of the tree 6086 of the knowledge 1847 of good 2896 and evil, 7451 thou shalt not eat 398-4 of it: for in the day 3117 that thou eatest 398-2 thereof thou shalt surely 4191-2 die. 4191-4
2:18 And the LORD 3068 God 430 said, 559-4 [It is] not good 2896 that the man 120 should be 1961-2 alone; I will make 6213-4 him an help 5828 meet for him.
2:19 And out of the ground 127 the LORD 3068 God 430 formed 3335-4 every beast 2416 of the field, 7704 and every fowl 5775 of the air; 8064 and brought 935-55 [them] unto Adam 120 to see 7200-2 what he would call 7121-4 them: and whatsoever Adam 120 called 7121-4 every living 2416 creature, 5315 that 1931 [was] the name 8034 thereof.
2:20 And Adam 120 gave 7121-4 names 8034 to all cattle, 929 and to the fowl 5775 of the air, 8064 and to every beast 2416 of the field; 7704 but for Adam 120 there was not found 4672-1 an help 5828 meet for him.
2:21 And the LORD 3068 God 430 caused a deep sleep 8639 to fall 5307-55 upon Adam, 120 and he slept: 3462-4 and he took 3947-4 one 259 of his ribs, 6763 and closed up 5462-4 the flesh 1320 instead thereof;
2:22 And the rib, 6763 which the LORD 3068 God 430 had taken 3947-1 from man, 120 made 1129-4 he a woman, 802 and brought 935-55 her unto the man. 120
2:23 And Adam 120 said, 559-4 This 2063 [is] now 6471 bone 6106 of my bones, 6106 and flesh 1320 of my flesh: 1320 she 2063 shall be called 7121-11 Woman, 802 because she 3588 was taken 3947-27 out of Man. 376
2:24 Therefore 3651 shall a man 376 leave 5800-4 his father 1 and his mother, 517 and shall cleave 1692-1 unto his wife: 802 and they shall be one 259 flesh. 1320
2:25 And they were both 8147 naked, 6174 the man 120 and his wife, 802 and were not ashamed. 954-113
3:1 Now the serpent 5175 was 1961-1 more subtil 6175 than any beast 2416 of the field 7704 which the LORD 3068 God 430 had made. 6213-1 And he said 559-4 unto the woman, 802 Yea, 637 hath God 430 said, 559-1 Ye shall not eat 398-4 of every tree 6086 of the garden? 1588
3:2 And the woman 802 said 559-4 unto the serpent, 5175 We may eat 398-4 of the fruit 6529 of the trees 6086 of the garden: 1588
3:3 But of the fruit 6529 of the tree 6086 which [is] in the midst 8432 of the garden, 1588 God 430 hath said, 559-1 Ye shall not eat 398-4 of it, neither shall ye touch 5060-4 it, lest 6435 ye die. 4191-4
3:4 And the serpent 5175 said 559-4 unto the woman, 802 Ye shall not surely 4191-2 die: 4191-4
3:5 For God 430 doth know 3045-6 that in the day 3117 ye eat 398-2 thereof, then your eyes 5869 shall be opened, 6491-8 and ye shall be as gods, 430 knowing 3045-6 good 2896 and evil. 7451
3:6 And when the woman 802 saw 7200-4 that the tree 6086 [was] good 2896 for food, 3978 and that it 1931 [was] pleasant 8378 to the eyes, 5869 and a tree 6086 to be desired 2530-12 to make [one] wise, 7919-53 she took 3947-4 of the fruit 6529 thereof, and did eat, 398-4 and gave 5414-4 also 1571 unto her husband 376 with her; and he did eat. 398-4
3:7 And the eyes 5869 of them both 8147 were opened, 6491-11 and they knew 3045-4 that they 1992 [were] naked; 5903 and they sewed fig 8384 leaves 5929 together, 8609-4 and made 6213-4 themselves aprons. 2290
3:8 And they heard 8085-4 the voice 6963 of the LORD 3068 God 430 walking 1980-102 in the garden 1588 in the cool 7307 of the day: 3117 and Adam 120 and his wife 802 hid 2244-101 themselves from the presence 6440 of the LORD 3068 God 430 amongst 8432 the trees 6086 of the garden. 1588
3:9 And the LORD 3068 God 430 called 7121-4 unto Adam, 120 and said 559-4 unto him, Where [art] thou? 335
3:10 And he said, 559-4 I heard 8085-1 thy voice 6963 in the garden, 1588 and I was afraid, 3372-4 because I 595 [was] naked; 5903 and I hid 2244-11 myself.
3:11 And he said, 559-4 Who 4310 told 5046-52 thee that thou [wast] naked? 5903 Hast thou eaten 398-1 of the tree, 6086 whereof I commanded 6680-14 thee that thou shouldest not 1115 eat? 398-2
3:12 And the man 120 said, 559-4 The woman 802 whom thou gavest 5414-1 [to be] with me, 5978 she 1931 gave 5414-1 me of the tree, 6086 and I did eat. 398-4
3:13 And the LORD 3068 God 430 said 559-4 unto the woman, 802 What [is] this [that] thou hast done? 6213-1 And the woman 802 said, 559-4 The serpent 5175 beguiled 5377-52 me, and I did eat. 398-4
3:14 And the LORD 3068 God 430 said 559-4 unto the serpent, 5175 Because thou hast done 6213-1 this, thou 859 [art] cursed 779-7 above all cattle, 929 and above every beast 2416 of the field; 7704 upon thy belly 1512 shalt thou go, 3212-4 and dust 6083 shalt thou eat 398-4 all the days 3117 of thy life: 2416
3:15 And I will put 7896-4 enmity 342 between thee and the woman, 802 and between thy seed 2233 and her seed; 2233 it shall bruise 7779-4 thy head, 7218 and thou shalt bruise 7779-4 his heel. 6119
3:16 Unto the woman 802 he said, 559-1 I will greatly 7235-53 multiply 7235-55 thy sorrow 6093 and thy conception; 2032 in sorrow 6089 thou shalt bring forth 3205-4 children; 1121 and thy desire 8669 [shall be] to thy husband, 376 and he shall rule 4910-4 over thee.
3:17 And unto Adam 120 he said, 559-1 Because thou hast hearkened 8085-1 unto the voice 6963 of thy wife, 802 and hast eaten 398-4 of the tree, 6086 of which 834 I commanded 6680-14 thee, saying, 559-2 Thou shalt not eat 398-4 of it: cursed 779-7 [is] the ground 127 for thy sake; in sorrow 6093 shalt thou eat 398-4 [of] it all 3605 the days 3117 of thy life; 2416
3:18 Thorns 6975 also and thistles 1863 shall it bring forth 6779-55 to thee; and thou shalt eat 398-1 the herb 6212 of the field; 7704
3:19 In the sweat 2188 of thy face 639 shalt thou eat 398-4 bread, 3899 till 5704 thou return 7725-2 unto the ground; 127 for out of it wast thou taken: 3947-27 for dust 6083 thou 859 [art], and unto dust 6083 shalt thou return. 7725-4
3:20 And Adam 120 called 7121-4 his wife's 802 name 8034 Eve; 2332 because she was the mother 517 of all living. 2416
3:21 Unto Adam 120 also and to his wife 802 did the LORD 3068 God 430 make 6213-4 coats 3801 of skins, 5785 and clothed 3847-55 them.
3:22 And the LORD 3068 God 430 said, 559-4 Behold, 2005 the man 120 is become as one 259 of us, to know 3045-2 good 2896 and evil: 7451 and now, lest he put forth 7971-4 his hand, 3027 and take 3947-1 also of the tree 6086 of life, 2416 and eat, 398-1 and live 2425-1 for ever: 5769
3:23 Therefore the LORD 3068 God 430 sent him forth 7971-17 from the garden 1588 of Eden, 5731 to till 5647-2 the ground 127 from whence he was taken. 3947-27
3:24 So he drove out 1644-17 the man; 120 and he placed 7931-55 at the east 6924 of the garden 1588 of Eden 5731 Cherubims, 3742 and a flaming 3858 sword 2719 which turned every way, 2015-102 to keep 8104-2 the way 1870 of the tree 6086 of life. 2416
4:1 And Adam 120 knew 3045-1 853 Eve 2332 his wife; 802 and she conceived, 2029-4 and bare 3205-4 853 Cain, 7014 and said, 559-4 I have gotten 7069-1 a man 376 from 854 the LORD. 3068
4:2 And she again 3254-55 bare 3205-2 his brother 251 Abel. 1893 And Abel 1893 was a keeper 7462-6 of sheep, 6629 but Cain 7014 was a tiller 5647-6 of the ground. 127
4:3 And in process 7093 of time 3117 it came to pass, that Cain 7014 brought 935-55 of the fruit 6529 of the ground 127 an offering 4503 unto the LORD. 3068
4:4 And Abel, 1893 he 1931 also brought 935-52 of the firstlings 1062 of his flock 6629 and of the fat 2459 thereof. And the LORD 3068 had respect 8159-4 unto Abel 1893 and to his offering: 4503
4:5 But unto Cain 7014 and to his offering 4503 he had not respect. 8159-1 And Cain 7014 was very 3966 wroth, 2734-4 and his countenance 6440 fell. 5307-4
4:6 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Cain, 7014 Why art thou wroth? 2734-1 and why is thy countenance 6440 fallen? 5307-1
4:7 If 518 thou doest well, 3190-55 shalt thou not be accepted? 7613 and if thou doest not well, 3190-55 sin 2403 lieth 7257-6 at the door. 6607 And unto thee [shall be] his desire, 8669 and thou shalt rule 4910-4 over him.
4:8 And Cain 7014 talked 559-4 with 413 Abel 1893 his brother: 251 and it came to pass, when they were in the field, 7704 that Cain 7014 rose up 6965-4 against 413 Abel 1893 his brother, 251 and slew him. 2026-4
4:9 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Cain, 7014 Where 335 [is] Abel 1893 thy brother? 251 And he said, 559-4 I know 3045-1 not: [Am] I my brother's 251 keeper? 8104-6
4:10 And he said, 559-4 What 4100 hast thou done? 6213-1 the voice 6963 of thy brother's 251 blood 1818 crieth 6817-6 unto me from the ground. 127
4:11 And now [art] thou cursed 779-7 from the earth, 127 which hath opened 6475-1 her mouth 6310 to receive 3947-2 thy brother's 251 blood 1818 from thy hand; 3027
4:12 When 3588 thou tillest 5647-4 the ground, 127 it shall not henceforth 3254-55 yield 5414-2 unto thee her strength; 3581 a fugitive 5128-5 and a vagabond 5110-6 shalt thou be in the earth. 776
4:13 And Cain 7014 said 559-4 unto the LORD, 3068 My punishment 5771 [is] greater 1419 than I can bear. 5375-2
4:14 Behold, thou hast driven me out 1644-14 this day 3117 from 5921 the face 6440 of the earth; 127 and from thy face 6440 shall I be hid; 5641-11 and I shall be a fugitive 5128-5 and a vagabond 5110-6 in the earth; 776 and it shall come to pass, 1961-1 [that] every one that findeth 4672-6 me shall slay me. 2026-4
4:15 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto him, Therefore 3651 whosoever slayeth 2026-6 Cain, 7014 vengeance 5358-93 shall be taken on him sevenfold. 7659 And the LORD 3068 set 7760-4 a mark 226 upon Cain, 7014 lest 1115 any finding 4672-6 him should kill 5221-53 him.
4:16 And Cain 7014 went out 3318-4 from the presence 6440 of the LORD, 3068 and dwelt 3427-4 in the land 776 of Nod, 5113 on the east 6926 of Eden. 5731
4:17 And Cain 7014 knew 3045-4 his wife; 802 and she conceived, 2029-4 and bare 3205-4 Enoch: 2585 and he builded 1129-6 a city, 5892 and called 7121-4 the name 8034 of the city, 5892 after the name 8034 of his son, 1121 Enoch. 2585
4:18 And unto Enoch 2585 was born 3205-11 Irad: 5897 and Irad 5897 begat 3205-1 Mehujael: 4232 and Mehujael 4232 begat 3205-1 Methusael: 4967 and Methusael 4967 begat 3205-1 Lamech. 3929
4:19 And Lamech 3929 took 3947-4 unto him two 8147 wives: 802 the name 8034 of the one 259 [was] Adah, 5711 and the name 8034 of the other 8145 Zillah. 6741
4:20 And Adah 5711 bare 3205-4 Jabal: 2989 he was the father 1 of such as dwell 3427-6 in tents, 168 and [of such as have] cattle. 4735
4:21 And his brother's 251 name 8034 [was] Jubal: 3106 he was the father 1 of all such as handle 8610-6 the harp 3658 and organ. 5748
4:22 And Zillah, 6741 she also bare 3205-1 Tubalcain, 8423 an instructer 3913-7 of every artificer 2794 in brass 5178 and iron: 1270 and the sister 269 of Tubalcain 8423 [was] Naamah. 5279
4:23 And Lamech 3929 said 559-4 unto his wives, 802 Adah 5711 and Zillah, 6741 Hear 8085-3 my voice; 6963 ye wives 802 of Lamech, 3929 hearken 238-54 unto my speech: 565 for I have slain 2026-1 a man 376 to my wounding, 6482 and a young man 3206 to my hurt. 2250
4:24 If 3588 Cain 7014 shall be avenged 5358-93 sevenfold, 7659 truly Lamech 3929 seventy 7657 and sevenfold. 7651
4:25 And Adam 120 knew 3045-4 his wife 802 again; 5750 and she bare 3205-4 a son, 1121 and called 7121-4 his name 8034 Seth: 8352 For God, 430 [said she], hath appointed 7896-1 me another 312 seed 2233 instead 8478 of Abel, 1893 whom 3588 Cain 7014 slew. 2026-1
4:26 And to Seth, 8352 to him 1931 also there was born 3205-27 a son; 1121 and he called 7121-4 his name 8034 Enos: 583 then began men 2490-90 to call 7121-2 upon the name 8034 of the LORD. 3068
5:1 This 2088 [is] the book 5612 of the generations 8435 of Adam. 120 In the day 3117 that God 430 created 1254-2 man, 120 in the likeness 1823 of God 430 made 6213-1 he him;
5:2 Male 2145 and female 5347 created 1254-1 he them; and blessed 1288-17 them, and called 7121-4 their name 8034 Adam, 120 in the day 3117 when they were created. 1254-9

6:1 And it came to pass, when men 120 began 2490-52 to multiply 7231-2 on 5921 the face 6440 of the earth, 127 and daughters 1323 were born 3205-27 unto them,
6:2 That the sons 1121 of God 430 saw 7200-4 the daughters 1323 of men 120 that they 2007 [were] fair; 2896 and they took 3947-4 them wives 802 of all which they chose. 977-1
6:3 And the LORD 3068 said, 559-4 My spirit 7307 shall not always 5769 strive 1777-4 with man, 120 for that he also 1571 [is] flesh: 1320 7683-2 yet his days 3117 shall be an hundred 3967 and twenty 6242 years. 8141
6:4 There were giants 5303 in the earth 776 in those 1992 days; 3117 and also after 310 that, 3651 when 834 the sons 1121 of God 430 came in 935-4 unto the daughters 1323 of men, 120 and they bare 3205-1 [children] to them, the same 1992 [became] mighty men 1368 which [were] of old, 5769 men 582 of renown. 8034
6:5 And GOD 3068 saw 7200-4 that the wickedness 7451 of man 120 [was] great 7227 in the earth, 776 and [that] every imagination 3336 of the thoughts 4284 of his heart 3820 [was] only 7535 evil 7451 continually. 3117
6:6 And it repented 5162-11 the LORD 3068 that he had made 6213-1 man 120 on the earth, 776 and it grieved 6087-101 him at 413 his heart. 3820
6:7 And the LORD 3068 said, 559-4 I will destroy 4229-4 man 120 whom I have created 1254-1 from the face 6440 of the earth; 127 both man, 120 and 5704 beast, 929 and the creeping thing, 7431 and the fowls 5775 of the air; 8064 for it repenteth 5162-8 me that I have made 6213-1 them.
6:8 But Noah 5146 found 4672-1 grace 2580 in the eyes 5869 of the LORD. 3068
6:9 These [are] the generations 8435 of Noah: 5146 Noah 5146 was a just 6662 man 376 [and] perfect 8549 in his generations, 1755 [and] Noah 5146 walked 1980-98 with God. 430
6:10 And Noah 5146 begat 3205-55 three 7969 sons, 1121 Shem, 8035 Ham, 2526 and Japheth. 3315
6:11 The earth 776 also was corrupt 7843-11 before 6440 God, 430 and the earth 776 was filled 4390-11 with violence. 2555
6:12 And God 430 looked 7200-4 upon the earth, 776 and, behold, it was corrupt; 7843-8 for all flesh 1320 had corrupted 7843-52 his way 1870 upon the earth. 776
6:13 And God 430 said 559-4 unto Noah, 5146 The end 7093 of all flesh 1320 is come 935-1 before 6440 me; for the earth 776 is filled 4390-1 with violence 2555 through 6440 them; and, behold, I will destroy 7843-56 them with 854 the earth. 776
6:14 Make 6213-3 thee an ark 8392 of gopher 1613 wood; 6086 rooms 7064 shalt thou make 6213-4 in 854 the ark, 8392 and shalt pitch 3722-1 it within 1004 and without 2351 with pitch. 3724
6:15 And this [is the fashion] which thou shalt make 6213-4 it [of]: The length 753 of the ark 8392 [shall be] three 7969 hundred 3967 cubits, 520 the breadth 7341 of it fifty 2572 cubits, 520 and the height 6967 of it thirty 7970 cubits. 520
6:16 A window 6672 shalt thou make 6213-4 to the ark, 8392 and in a cubit 520 shalt thou finish 3615-17 it above; 4605 and the door 6607 of the ark 8392 shalt thou set 7760-4 in the side 6654 thereof; [with] lower, 8482 second, 8145 and third 7992 [stories] shalt thou make 6213-4 it.
6:17 And, behold, 2009 I, 589 even I, do bring 935-56 a flood 3999 of waters 4325 upon the earth, 776 to destroy 7843-15 all flesh, 1320 wherein [is] the breath 7307 of life, 2416 from under 8478 heaven; 8064 [and] every thing 3605 that [is] in the earth 776 shall die. 1478-4
6:18 But with thee will I establish 6965-52 my covenant; 1285 and thou shalt come 935-1 into 413 the ark, 8392 thou, 859 and thy sons, 1121 and thy wife, 802 and thy sons' 1121 wives 802 with thee.
6:19 And of every living thing 2416 of all flesh, 1320 two 8147 of every [sort] shalt thou bring 935-55 into the ark, 8392 to keep [them] alive 2421-53 with thee; they shall be male 2145 and female. 5347
6:20 Of fowls 5775 after their kind, 4327 and of cattle 929 after their kind, 4327 of every creeping thing 7431 of the earth 127 after his kind, 4327 two 8147 of every [sort] shall come 935-4 unto thee, to keep [them] alive. 2421-53
6:21 And take 3947-3 thou unto thee of all food 3978 that is eaten, 398-11 and thou shalt gather 622-1 [it] to thee; and it shall be for food 402 for thee, and for them.
6:22 Thus did 6213-4 Noah; 5146 according to all that God 430 commanded 6680-14 him, so did 6213-1 he.
7:1 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Noah, 5146 Come 935-3 thou and all thy house 1004 into the ark; 8392 for thee have I seen 7200-1 righteous 6662 before 6440 me in this 2088 generation. 1755
7:2 Of every clean 2889 beast 929 thou shalt take 3947-4 to thee by sevens, 7651 7651 the male 376 and his female: 802 and of beasts 929 that [are] not clean 2889 1931 by two, 8147 the male 376 and his female. 802
7:3 Of fowls 5775 also of the air 8064 by sevens, 7651 7651 the male 2145 and the female; 5347 to keep seed 2233 alive 2421-15 upon the face 6440 of all the earth. 776
7:4 For yet 5750 seven 7651 days, 3117 and I will cause it to rain 4305-56 upon the earth 776 forty 705 days 3117 and forty 705 nights; 3915 and every 3605 living substance 3351 that I have made 6213-1 will I destroy 4229-1 from off 5921 the face 6440 of the earth. 127
7:5 And Noah 5146 did 6213-4 according unto all that the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 him.
7:6 And Noah 5146 [was] six 8337 hundred 3967 years 8141 old 1121 when the flood 3999 of waters 4325 was upon the earth. 776
7:7 And Noah 5146 went in, 935-4 and his sons, 1121 and his wife, 802 and his sons' 1121 wives 802 with him, into the ark, 8392 because of 6440 the waters 4325 of the flood. 3999
7:8 Of clean 2889 beasts, 929 and of beasts 929 that [are] not clean, 2889 and of fowls, 5775 and of every thing that creepeth 7430-6 upon the earth, 127
7:9 There went in 935-1 two 8147 and two 8147 unto Noah 5146 into the ark, 8392 the male 2145 and the female, 5347 as 834 God 430 had commanded 6680-14 Noah. 5146
7:10 And it came to pass after seven 7651 days, 3117 that the waters 4325 of the flood 3999 were upon the earth. 776
7:11 In the 8141 six 8337 hundredth 3967 year 8141 of Noah's 5146 life, 2416 in the second 8145 month, 2320 the seventeenth 7651 6240 day 3117 of the month, 2320 the same 2088 day 3117 were all the fountains 4599 of the great 7227 deep 8415 broken up, 1234-8 and the windows 699 of heaven 8064 were opened. 6605-8
7:12 And the rain 1653 was upon the earth 776 forty 705 days 3117 and forty 705 nights. 3915
7:13 In the selfsame 6106 day 3117 entered 935-1 Noah, 5146 and Shem, 8035 and Ham, 2526 and Japheth, 3315 the sons 1121 of Noah, 5146 and Noah's 5146 wife, 802 and the three 7969 wives 802 of his sons 1121 with them, into the ark; 8392
7:14 They, 1992 and every beast 2416 after his kind, 4327 and all the cattle 929 after their kind, 4327 and every creeping thing 7431 that creepeth 7430-6 upon the earth 776 after his kind, 4327 and every fowl 5775 after his kind, 4327 every bird 6833 of every sort. 3671
7:15 And they went in 935-4 unto Noah 5146 into the ark, 8392 two 8147 and two 8147 of all flesh, 1320 wherein 834 [is] the breath 7307 of life. 2416
7:16 And they that went in, 935-6 went in 935-1 male 2145 and female 5347 of all flesh, 1320 as God 430 had commanded 6680-14 him: and the LORD 3068 shut 5462-4 him in.
7:17 And the flood 3999 was forty 705 days 3117 upon the earth; 776 and the waters 4325 increased, 7235-4 and bare up 5375-4 the ark, 8392 and it was lift up 7311-4 above the earth. 776
7:18 And the waters 4325 prevailed, 1396-4 and were increased 7235-4 greatly 3966 upon the earth; 776 and the ark 8392 went 3212-4 upon the face 6440 of the waters. 4325
7:19 And the waters 4325 prevailed 1396-1 exceedingly 3966 3966 upon the earth; 776 and all the high 1364 hills, 2022 that [were] under 8478 the whole heaven, 8064 were covered. 3680-29
7:20 Fifteen 6240 2568 cubits 520 upward 4605 did the waters 4325 prevail; 1396-1 and the mountains 2022 were covered. 3680-29
7:21 And all flesh 1320 died 1478-4 that moved 7430-6 upon the earth, 776 both of fowl, 5775 and of cattle, 929 and of beast, 2416 and of every creeping thing 8318 that creepeth 8317-6 upon the earth, 776 and every man: 120
7:22 All in whose nostrils 639 [was] the breath 5397 7307 of life, 2416 of all that [was] in the dry 2724 [land], died. 4191-1
7:23 And every living substance 3351 was destroyed 4229-11 which was upon the face 6440 of the ground, 127 both man, 120 and cattle, 929 and the creeping things, 7431 and the fowl 5775 of the heaven; 8064 and they were destroyed 4229-11 from the earth: 776 and Noah 5146 only 389 remained 7604-11 [alive], and they that 834 [were] with him in the ark. 8392
7:24 And the waters 4325 prevailed 1396-4 upon the earth 776 an hundred 3967 and fifty 2572 days. 3117
8:1 And God 430 remembered 2142-4 Noah, 5146 and every living thing, 2416 and all the cattle 929 that [was] with him in the ark: 8392 and God 430 made a wind 7307 to pass 5674-55 over 5921 the earth, 776 and the waters 4325 asswaged; 7918-4
8:2 The fountains 4599 also of the deep 8415 and the windows 699 of heaven 8064 were stopped, 5534-11 and the rain 1653 from heaven 8064 was restrained; 3607-11
8:3 And the waters 4325 returned 7725-4 from off the earth 776 continually: 1980-2 7725-2 and after the end 7097 of the hundred 3967 and fifty 2572 days 3117 the waters 4325 were abated. 2637-4
8:4 And the ark 8392 rested 5117-4 in the seventh 7637 month, 2320 on the seventeenth 6240 7651 day 3117 of the month, 2320 upon the mountains 2022 of Ararat. 780
8:5 And the waters 4325 decreased 2637-2 continually 1980-2 until 5704 the tenth 6224 month: 2320 in the tenth 6224 [month], on the first 259 [day] of the month, 2320 were the tops 7218 of the mountains 2022 seen. 7200-8
8:6 And it came to pass at the end 7093 of forty 705 days, 3117 that Noah 5146 opened 6605-4 the window 2474 of the ark 8392 which he had made: 6213-1
8:7 And he sent forth 7971-17 a raven, 6158 which went forth 3318-4 to 3318-2 and fro, 7725-2 until the waters 4325 were dried up 3001-2 from off the earth. 776
8:8 Also he sent forth 7971-17 a dove 3123 from him, to see 7200-2 if the waters 4325 were abated 7043-1 from off the face 6440 of the ground; 127
8:9 But the dove 3123 found 4672-1 no rest 4494 for the sole 3709 of her foot, 7272 and she returned 7725-4 unto him into the ark, 8392 for the waters 4325 [were] on the face 6440 of the whole earth: 776 then he put forth 7971-4 his hand, 3027 and took her, 3947-4 and pulled her in 935-55 unto him into the ark. 8392
8:10 And he stayed 2342-4 yet other 312 seven 7651 days; 3117 and again 3254-55 he sent forth 7971-15 the dove 3123 out of the ark; 8392
8:11 And the dove 3123 came in 935-4 to him in the evening; 6256 6153 and, lo, in her mouth 6310 [was] an olive 2132 leaf 5929 pluckt off: 2965 so Noah 5146 knew 3045-4 that the waters 4325 were abated 7043-1 from off the earth. 776
8:12 And he stayed 3176-11 yet other 312 seven 7651 days; 3117 and sent forth 7971-17 the dove; 3123 which returned 7725-2 not again 3254-1 unto him any more. 5750
8:13 And it came to pass in the six 8337 hundredth 3967 and first 259 year, 8141 in the first 7223 [month], the first 259 [day] of the month, 2320 the waters 4325 were dried up 2717-1 from off the earth: 776 and Noah 5146 removed 5493-55 the covering 4372 of the ark, 8392 and looked, 7200-4 and, behold, the face 6440 of the ground 127 was dry. 2717-1
8:14 And in the second 8145 month, 2320 on the seven 7651 and twentieth 6242 day 3117 of the month, 2320 was the earth 776 dried. 3001-1
8:15 And God 430 spake 1696-17 unto Noah, 5146 saying, 559-2
8:16 Go forth 3318-3 of the ark, 8392 thou, and thy wife, 802 and thy sons, 1121 and thy sons' 1121 wives 802 with thee.
8:17 Bring forth 3318-54 with thee every living thing 2416 that [is] with thee, of all flesh, 1320 [both] of fowl, 5775 and of cattle, 929 and of every creeping thing 7431 that creepeth 7430-6 upon the earth; 776 that they may breed abundantly 8317-1 in the earth, 776 and be fruitful, 6509-1 and multiply 7235-1 upon the earth. 776
8:18 And Noah 5146 went forth, 3318-4 and his sons, 1121 and his wife, 802 and his sons' 1121 wives 802 with him:
8:19 Every beast, 2416 every creeping thing, 7431 and every fowl, 5775 [and] whatsoever 3605 creepeth 7430-6 upon the earth, 776 after their kinds, 4940 went forth 3318-1 out of the ark. 8392
8:20 And Noah 5146 builded 1129-4 an altar 4196 unto the LORD; 3068 and took 3947-4 of every clean 2889 beast, 929 and of every clean 2889 fowl, 5775 and offered 5927-55 burnt offerings 5930 on the altar. 4196
8:21 And the LORD 3068 smelled 7306-55 a sweet 5207 savour; 7381 and the LORD 3068 said 559-4 in 413 his heart, 3820 I will not again 3254-55 curse 7043-15 the ground 127 any more for man's 120 sake; 5668 for the imagination 3336 of man's 120 heart 3820 [is] evil 7451 from his youth; 5271 neither will I again 3254-55 smite 5221-53 any more every thing living, 2416 as I have done. 6213-1
8:22 While the earth 776 remaineth, 3117 seedtime 2233 and harvest, 7105 and cold 7120 and heat, 2527 and summer 7019 and winter, 2779 and day 3117 and night 3915 shall not cease. 7673-4
9:1 And God 430 blessed 1288-17 Noah 5146 and his sons, 1121 and said 559-4 unto them, Be fruitful, 6509-3 and multiply, 7235-3 and replenish 4390-3 the earth. 776
9:2 And the fear of you 4172 and the dread of you 2844 shall be upon every beast 2416 of the earth, 776 and upon every fowl 5775 of the air, 8064 upon all that moveth 7430-4 [upon] the earth, 127 and upon all the fishes 1709 of the sea; 3220 into your hand 3027 are they delivered. 5414-8
9:3 Every moving thing 7431 that liveth 2416 shall be meat 402 for you; even as the green 3418 herb 6212 have I given 5414-1 you all things.
9:4 But 389 flesh 1320 with the life 5315 thereof, [which is] the blood 1818 thereof, shall ye not eat. 398-4
9:5 And surely 389 your blood 1818 of your lives 5315 will I require; 1875-4 at the hand 3027 of every beast 2416 will I require it, 1875-4 and at the hand 3027 of man; 120 at the hand 3027 of every man's 376 brother 251 will I require 1875-4 the life 5315 of man. 120
9:6 Whoso sheddeth 8210-6 man's 120 blood, 1818 by man 120 shall his blood 1818 be shed: 8210-11 for in the image 6754 of God 430 made 6213-1 he man. 120
9:7 And you, be ye fruitful, 6509-3 and multiply; 7235-3 bring forth abundantly 8317-3 in the earth, 776 and multiply 7235-3 therein.
9:8 And God 430 spake 559-4 unto Noah, 5146 and to his sons 1121 with him, saying, 559-2
9:9 And I, behold, I establish 6965-56 my covenant 1285 with you, and with your seed 2233 after 310 you;
9:10 And with every living 2416 creature 5315 that [is] with you, of the fowl, 5775 of the cattle, 929 and of every beast 2416 of the earth 776 with you; from all that go out 3318-6 of the ark, 8392 to every beast 2416 of the earth. 776
9:11 And I will establish 6965-52 my covenant 1285 with you; neither shall all flesh 1320 be cut off 3772-11 any more by the waters 4325 of a flood; 3999 neither shall there any more be a flood 3999 to destroy 7843-15 the earth. 776
9:12 And God 430 said, 559-4 This [is] the token 226 of the covenant 1285 which I 589 make 5414-6 between me and you and every living 2416 creature 5315 that [is] with you, for perpetual 5769 generations: 1755
9:13 I do set 5414-1 my bow 7198 in the cloud, 6051 and it shall be for a token 226 of a covenant 1285 between me and the earth. 776
9:14 And it shall come to pass, when I bring 6049-15 a cloud 6051 over the earth, 776 that the bow 7198 shall be seen 7200-8 in the cloud: 6051
9:15 And I will remember 2142-1 my covenant, 1285 which [is] between me and you and every living 2416 creature 5315 of all flesh; 1320 and the waters 4325 shall no more 5750 become a flood 3999 to destroy 7843-15 all flesh. 1320
9:16 And the bow 7198 shall be in the cloud; 6051 and I will look 7200-1 upon it, that I may remember 2142-2 the everlasting 5769 covenant 1285 between 996 God 430 and 996 every living 2416 creature 5315 of all flesh 1320 that [is] upon the earth. 776
9:17 And God 430 said 559-4 unto Noah, 5146 This [is] the token 226 of the covenant, 1285 which I have established 6965-52 between me and all flesh 1320 that [is] upon the earth. 776
9:18 And the sons 1121 of Noah, 5146 that went forth 3318-6 of the ark, 8392 were Shem, 8035 and Ham, 2526 and Japheth: 3315 and Ham 2526 1931 [is] the father 1 of Canaan. 3667
9:19 These [are] the three 7969 sons 1121 of Noah: 5146 and of them was the whole earth 776 overspread. 5310-1
9:20 And Noah 5146 began 2490-55 [to be] an husbandman, 376 127 and he planted 5193-4 a vineyard: 3754
9:21 And he drank 8354-4 of the wine, 3196 and was drunken; 7937-4 and he was uncovered 1540-101 within 8432 his tent. 168
9:22 And Ham, 2526 the father 1 of Canaan, 3667 saw 7200-4 the nakedness 6172 of his father, 1 and told 5046-55 his two 8147 brethren 251 without. 2351
9:23 And Shem 8035 and Japheth 3315 took 3947-4 a garment, 8071 and laid 7760-4 [it] upon both 8147 their shoulders, 7926 and went 3212-4 backward, 322 and covered 3680-17 the nakedness 6172 of their father; 1 and their faces 6440 [were] backward, 322 and they saw 7200-1 not their father's 1 nakedness. 6172
9:24 And Noah 5146 awoke 3364-4 from his wine, 3196 and knew 3045-4 what his younger 6996 son 1121 had done 6213-1 unto him.
9:25 And he said, 559-4 Cursed 779-7 [be] Canaan; 3667 a servant 5650 of servants 5650 shall he be unto his brethren. 251
9:26 And he said, 559-4 Blessed 1288-7 [be] the LORD 3068 God 430 of Shem; 8035 and Canaan 3667 shall be 1961-4 his servant. 5650
9:27 God 430 shall enlarge 6601-55 Japheth, 3315 and he shall dwell 7931-4 in the tents 168 of Shem; 8035 and Canaan 3667 shall be his servant. 5650
9:28 And Noah 5146 lived 2421-4 after 310 the flood 3999 three 7969 hundred 3967 8141 and fifty 2572 years. 8141
9:29 And all the days 3117 of Noah 5146 were nine 8672 hundred 3967 8141 and fifty 2572 years: 8141 and he died. 4191-4
10:1 Now these [are] the generations 8435 of the sons 1121 of Noah, 5146 Shem, 8035 Ham, 2526 and Japheth: 3315 and unto them were sons 1121 born 3205-11 after 310 the flood. 3999
10:2 The sons 1121 of Japheth; 3315 Gomer, 1586 and Magog, 4031 and Madai, 4074 and Javan, 3120 and Tubal, 8422 and Meshech, 4902 and Tiras. 8494
10:3 And the sons 1121 of Gomer; 1586 Ashkenaz, 813 and Riphath, 7384 and Togarmah. 8425
10:4 And the sons 1121 of Javan; 3120 Elishah, 473 and Tarshish, 8659 Kittim, 3794 and Dodanim. 1721
10:5 By these were the isles 339 of the Gentiles 1471 divided 6504-8 in their lands; 776 every one 376 after his tongue, 3956 after their families, 4940 in their nations. 1471
10:6 And the sons 1121 of Ham; 2526 Cush, 3568 and Mizraim, 4714 and Phut, 6316 and Canaan. 3667
10:7 And the sons 1121 of Cush; 3568 Seba, 5434 and Havilah, 2341 and Sabtah, 5454 and Raamah, 7484 and Sabtecha: 5455 and the sons 1121 of Raamah; 7484 Sheba, 7614 and Dedan. 1719
10:8 And Cush 3568 begat 3205-1 Nimrod: 5248 he began 2490-52 to be 1961-2 a mighty one 1368 in the earth. 776
10:9 He was a mighty 1368 hunter 6718 before 6440 the LORD: 3068 wherefore 3651 it is said, 559-11 Even as Nimrod 5248 the mighty 1368 hunter 6718 before 6440 the LORD. 3068
10:10 And the beginning 7225 of his kingdom 4467 was Babel, 894 and Erech, 751 and Accad, 390 and Calneh, 3641 in the land 776 of Shinar. 8152
10:11 Out of that land 776 went forth 3318-1 Asshur, 804 and builded 1129-4 Nineveh, 5210 and the city 5892 Rehoboth, 7344 and Calah, 3625
10:12 And Resen 7449 between Nineveh 5210 and Calah: 3625 the same [is] a great 1419 city. 5892
10:13 And Mizraim 4714 begat 3205-1 Ludim, 3866 and Anamim, 6047 and Lehabim, 3853 and Naphtuhim, 5320
10:14 And Pathrusim, 6625 and Casluhim, 3695 (out of whom came 3318-1 Philistim,) 6430 and Caphtorim. 3732
10:15 And Canaan 3667 begat 3205-1 Sidon 6721 his firstborn, 1060 and Heth, 2845
10:16 And the Jebusite, 2983 and the Amorite, 567 and the Girgasite, 1622
10:17 And the Hivite, 2340 and the Arkite, 6208 and the Sinite, 5513
10:18 And the Arvadite, 721 and the Zemarite, 6786 and the Hamathite: 2577 and afterward 310 were the families 4940 of the Canaanites 3669 spread abroad. 6327-8
10:19 And the border 1366 of the Canaanites 3669 was from Sidon, 6721 as thou comest 935-2 to Gerar, 1642 unto Gaza; 5804 as thou goest, 935-2 unto Sodom, 5467 and Gomorrah, 6017 and Admah, 126 and Zeboim, 6636 even unto Lasha. 3962
10:20 These [are] the sons 1121 of Ham, 2526 after their families, 4940 after their tongues, 3956 in their countries, 776 [and] in their nations. 1471
10:21 Unto Shem 8035 also, the father 1 of all the children 1121 of Eber, 5677 the brother 251 of Japheth 3315 the elder, 1419 even to him were [children] born. 3205-27
10:22 The children 1121 of Shem; 8035 Elam, 5867 and Asshur, 804 and Arphaxad, 775 and Lud, 3865 and Aram. 758
10:23 And the children 1121 of Aram; 758 Uz, 5780 and Hul, 2343 and Gether, 1666 and Mash. 4851
10:24 And Arphaxad 775 begat 3205-1 Salah; 7974 and Salah 7974 begat 3205-1 Eber. 5677
10:25 And unto Eber 5677 were born 3205-27 two 8147 sons: 1121 the name 8034 of one 259 [was] Peleg; 6389 for in his days 3117 was the earth 776 divided; 6385-8 and his brother's 251 name 8034 [was] Joktan. 3355
10:26 And Joktan 3355 begat 3205-1 Almodad, 486 and Sheleph, 8026 and Hazarmaveth, 2700 and Jerah, 3392
10:27 And Hadoram, 1913 and Uzal, 187 and Diklah, 1853
10:28 And Obal, 5745 and Abimael, 39 and Sheba, 7614
10:29 And Ophir, 211 and Havilah, 2341 and Jobab: 3103 all these [were] the sons 1121 of Joktan. 3355
10:30 And their dwelling 4186 was from Mesha, 4852 as thou goest 935-2 unto Sephar 5611 a mount 2022 of the east. 6924
10:31 These [are] the sons 1121 of Shem, 8035 after their families, 4940 after their tongues, 3956 in their lands, 776 after their nations. 1471
10:32 These [are] the families 4940 of the sons 1121 of Noah, 5146 after their generations, 8435 in their nations: 1471 and by these were the nations 1471 divided 6504-8 in the earth 776 after 310 the flood. 3999
11:1 And the whole earth 776 was of one 259 language, 8193 and of one 259 speech. 1697
11:2 And it came to pass, as they journeyed 5265-2 from the east, 6924 that they found 4672-4 a plain 1237 in the land 776 of Shinar; 8152 and they dwelt 3427-4 there.
11:3 And they said 559-4 one 376 to another, 7453 Go to, 3051-3 let us make 3835-4 brick, 3843 and burn 8313-4 them throughly. 8316 And they had brick 3843 for stone, 68 and slime 2564 had 1961-1 they for morter. 2563
11:4 And they said, 559-4 Go to, 3051-3 let us build 1129-4 us a city 5892 and a tower, 4026 whose top 7218 [may reach] unto heaven; 8064 and let us make 6213-4 us a name, 8034 lest we be scattered 6327-4 abroad upon the face 6440 of the whole earth. 776
11:5 And the LORD 3068 came down 3381-4 to see 7200-2 the city 5892 and the tower, 4026 which the children 1121 of men 120 builded. 1129-1
11:6 And the LORD 3068 said, 559-4 Behold, the people 5971 [is] one, 259 and they have all one 259 language; 8193 and this they begin 2490-53 to do: 6213-2 and now nothing 3808 3605 will be restrained 1219-11 from them, which they have imagined 2161-4 to do. 6213-2
11:7 Go to, 3051-3 let us go down, 3381-4 and there confound 1101-4 their language, 8193 that 834 they may not understand 8085-4 one 376 another's 7453 speech. 8193
11:8 So the LORD 3068 scattered 6327-55 them abroad from thence 8033 upon the face 6440 of all the earth: 776 and they left off 2308-4 to build 1129-2 the city. 5892
11:9 Therefore is the name 8034 of it called 7121-1 Babel; 894 because the LORD 3068 did there confound 1101-1 the language 8193 of all the earth: 776 and from thence did the LORD 3068 scatter 6327-52 them abroad upon the face 6440 of all the earth. 776
11:10 These [are] the generations 8435 of Shem: 8035 Shem 8035 [was] an hundred 3967 years 8141 old, 1121 and begat 3205-55 Arphaxad 775 two years 8141 after 310 the flood: 3999
11:11 And Shem 8035 lived 2421-4 after 310 he begat 3205-53 Arphaxad 775 five 2568 hundred 3967 years, 8141 and begat 3205-55 sons 1121 and daughters. 1323
11:12 And Arphaxad 775 lived 2425-1 five 2568 and thirty 7970 years, 8141 and begat 3205-55 Salah: 7974
11:13 And Arphaxad 775 lived 2421-4 after 310 he begat 3205-53 Salah 7974 four 702 hundred 3967 8141 and three 7969 years, 8141 and begat 3205-55 sons 1121 and daughters. 1323
11:14 And Salah 7974 lived 2425-1 thirty 7970 years, 8141 and begat 3205-55 Eber: 5677
11:15 And Salah 7974 lived 2421-4 after 310 he begat 3205-53 Eber 5677 four 702 hundred 3967 8141 and three 7969 years, 8141 and begat 3205-55 sons 1121 and daughters. 1323
11:16 And Eber 5677 lived 2421-4 four 702 and thirty 7970 years, 8141 and begat 3205-55 Peleg: 6389
11:17 And Eber 5677 lived 2421-4 after 310 he begat 3205-53 Peleg 6389 four 702 hundred 3967 8141 and thirty 7970 years, 8141 and begat 3205-55 sons 1121 and daughters. 1323
11:18 And Peleg 6389 lived 2421-4 thirty 7970 years, 8141 and begat 3205-55 Reu: 7466
11:19 And Peleg 6389 lived 2421-4 after 310 he begat 3205-53 Reu 7466 two hundred 3967 8141 and nine 8672 years, 8141 and begat 3205-55 sons 1121 and daughters. 1323
11:20 And Reu 7466 lived 2421-4 two 8147 and thirty 7970 years, 8141 and begat 3205-55 Serug: 8286
11:21 And Reu 7466 lived 2421-4 after 310 he begat 3205-53 Serug 8286 two hundred 3967 8141 and seven 7651 years, 8141 and begat 3205-55 sons 1121 and daughters. 1323
11:22 And Serug 8286 lived 2421-4 thirty 7970 years, 8141 and begat 3205-55 Nahor: 5152
11:23 And Serug 8286 lived 2421-4 after 310 he begat 3205-53 Nahor 5152 two hundred 3967 years, 8141 and begat 3205-55 sons 1121 and daughters. 1323
11:24 And Nahor 5152 lived 2421-4 nine 8672 and twenty 6242 years, 8141 and begat 3205-55 Terah: 8646
11:25 And Nahor 5152 lived 2421-4 after 310 he begat 3205-53 Terah 8646 an hundred 3967 8141 and nineteen 6240 8672 years, 8141 and begat 3205-55 sons 1121 and daughters. 1323
11:26 And Terah 8646 lived 2421-4 seventy 7657 years, 8141 and begat 3205-55 Abram, 87 Nahor, 5152 and Haran. 2039
11:27 Now these [are] the generations 8435 of Terah: 8646 Terah 8646 begat 3205-52 Abram, 87 Nahor, 5152 and Haran; 2039 and Haran 2039 begat 3205-52 Lot. 3876
11:28 And Haran 2039 died 4191-4 before 6440 his father 1 Terah 8646 in the land 776 of his nativity, 4138 in Ur 218 of the Chaldees. 3778
11:29 And Abram 87 and Nahor 5152 took 3947-4 them wives: 802 the name 8034 of Abram's 87 wife 802 [was] Sarai; 8297 and the name 8034 of Nahor's 5152 wife, 802 Milcah, 4435 the daughter 1323 of Haran, 2039 the father 1 of Milcah, 4435 and the father 1 of Iscah. 3252
11:30 But Sarai 8297 was barren; 6135 she [had] no child. 2056
11:31 And Terah 8646 took 3947-4 Abram 87 his son, 1121 and Lot 3876 the son 1121 of Haran 2039 his son's 1121 son, 1121 and Sarai 8297 his daughter in law, 3618 his son 1121 Abram's 87 wife; 802 and they went forth 3318-4 with them from Ur 218 of the Chaldees, 3778 to go 3212-2 into the land 776 of Canaan; 3667 and they came 935-4 unto Haran, 2771 and dwelt 3427-4 there.
11:32 And the days 3117 of Terah 8646 were two hundred 3967 8141 and five 2568 years: 8141 and Terah 8646 died 4191-4 in Haran. 2771
12:1 Now the LORD 3068 had said 559-4 unto Abram, 87 Get 3212-3 thee out of thy country, 776 and from thy kindred, 4138 and from thy father's 1 house, 1004 unto a land 776 that I will shew 7200-55 thee:
12:2 And I will make 6213-4 of thee a great 1419 nation, 1471 and I will bless 1288-17 thee, and make thy name 8034 great; 1431-17 and thou shalt be a blessing: 1293
12:3 And I will bless 1288-17 them that bless 1288-18 thee, and curse 779-4 him that curseth 7043-18 thee: and in thee shall all families 4940 of the earth 127 be blessed. 1288-8
12:4 So Abram 87 departed, 3212-4 as the LORD 3068 had spoken 1696-14 unto him; and Lot 3876 went 3212-4 with him: and Abram 87 [was] seventy 7657 8141 and five 2568 years 8141 old 1121 when he departed 3318-2 out of Haran. 2771
12:5 And Abram 87 took 3947-4 Sarai 8297 his wife, 802 and Lot 3876 his brother's 251 son, 1121 and all their substance 7399 that they had gathered, 7408-1 and the souls 5315 that they had gotten 6213-1 in Haran; 2771 and they went forth 3318-4 to go 3212-2 into the land 776 of Canaan; 3667 and into the land 776 of Canaan 3667 they came. 935-4
12:6 And Abram 87 passed 5674-4 through the land 776 unto the place 4725 of Sichem, 7927 unto the plain 436 of Moreh. 4176 And the Canaanite 3669 [was] then 227 in the land. 776
12:7 And the LORD 3068 appeared 7200-11 unto Abram, 87 and said, 559-4 Unto thy seed 2233 will I give 5414-4 this 2063 land: 776 and there builded 1129-4 he an altar 4196 unto the LORD, 3068 who appeared 7200-12 unto him.
12:8 And he removed 6275-55 from thence unto a mountain 2022 on the east 6924 of Bethel, 1008 and pitched 5186-4 his tent, 168 [having] Bethel 1008 on the west, 3220 and Hai 5857 on the east: 6924 and there he builded 1129-4 an altar 4196 unto the LORD, 3068 and called 7121-4 upon the name 8034 of the LORD. 3068
12:9 And Abram 87 journeyed, 5265-4 going 1980-2 on still 5265-2 toward the south. 5045
12:10 And there was a famine 7458 in the land: 776 and Abram 87 went down 3381-4 into Egypt 4714 to sojourn 1481-2 there; for the famine 7458 [was] grievous 3515 in the land. 776
12:11 And it came to pass, when 834 he was come near 7126-52 to enter into 935-2 Egypt, 4714 that he said 559-4 unto Sarai 8297 his wife, 802 Behold 2009 now, 4994 I know 3045-1 that thou [art] a fair 3303 woman 802 to look upon: 4758
12:12 Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians 4713 shall see 7200-4 thee, that they shall say, 559-1 This [is] his wife: 802 and they will kill 2026-1 me, but they will save thee alive. 2421-17
12:13 Say, 559-3 I pray thee, 4994 thou [art] my sister: 269 that 4616 it may be well 3190-4 with me for thy sake; and my soul 5315 shall live 2421-1 because of thee. 1558
12:14 And it came to pass, that, when Abram 87 was come 935-2 into Egypt, 4714 the Egyptians 4713 beheld 7200-4 the woman 802 that she [was] very 3966 fair. 3303
12:15 The princes 8269 also of Pharaoh 6547 saw 7200-4 her, and commended 1984-17 her before 413 Pharaoh: 6547 and the woman 802 was taken 3947-93 into Pharaoh's 6547 house. 1004
12:16 And he entreated 3190-52 Abram 87 well for her sake: and he had sheep, 6629 and oxen, 1241 and he asses, 2543 and menservants, 5650 and maidservants, 8198 and she asses, 860 and camels. 1581
12:17 And the LORD 3068 plagued 5060-17 Pharaoh 6547 and his house 1004 with great 1419 plagues 5061 because of 1697 Sarai 8297 Abram's 87 wife. 802
12:18 And Pharaoh 6547 called 7121-4 Abram, 87 and said, 559-4 What [is] this [that] thou hast done 6213-1 unto me? why didst thou not tell 5046-52 me that she [was] thy wife? 802
12:19 Why saidst 559-1 thou, She [is] my sister? 269 so I might have taken 3947-4 her to me to wife: 802 now therefore behold thy wife, 802 take 3947-3 [her], and go 3212-3 thy way.
12:20 And Pharaoh 6547 commanded 6680-17 [his] men 582 concerning him: and they sent him away, 7971-17 and his wife, 802 and all that he had.
13:1 And Abram 87 went up 5927-4 out of Egypt, 4714 he, and his wife, 802 and all that he had, and Lot 3876 with him, into the south. 5045
13:2 And Abram 87 [was] very 3966 rich 3513-1 in cattle, 4735 in silver, 3701 and in gold. 2091
13:3 And he went 3212-4 on his journeys 4550 from the south 5045 even to Bethel, 1008 unto the place 4725 where his tent 168 had been 1961-1 at the beginning, 8462 between Bethel 1008 and Hai; 5857
13:4 Unto the place 4725 of the altar, 4196 which he had made 6213-1 there at the first: 7223 and there Abram 87 called 7121-4 on the name 8034 of the LORD. 3068
13:5 And Lot 3876 also, which went 1980-6 with 854 Abram, 87 had flocks, 6629 and herds, 1241 and tents. 168
13:6 And the land 776 was not able to bear 5375-1 them, that they might dwell 3427-2 together: 3162 for their substance 7399 was great, 7227 so that they could 3201-1 not dwell 3427-2 together. 3162
13:7 And there was a strife 7379 between the herdmen 7462-6 of Abram's 87 cattle 4735 and the herdmen 7462-6 of Lot's 3876 cattle: 4735 and the Canaanite 3669 and the Perizzite 6522 dwelled 3427-6 then in the land. 776
13:8 And Abram 87 said 559-4 unto Lot, 3876 Let there be 1961-4 no 408 strife, 4808 I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen 7462-6 and thy herdmen; 7462-6 for we 582 [be] brethren. 251
13:9 [Is] not the whole land 776 before 6440 thee? separate 6504-10 thyself, I pray thee, from me: if [thou wilt take] the left hand, 8040 then I will go to the right; 3231-55 or if [thou depart] to the right hand, 3225 then I will go to the left. 8041-55
13:10 And Lot 3876 lifted up 5375-4 his eyes, 5869 and beheld 7200-4 all the plain 3603 of Jordan, 3383 that it [was] well watered 4945 every where, before 6440 the LORD 3068 destroyed 7843-15 Sodom 5467 and Gomorrah, 6017 [even] as the garden 1588 of the LORD, 3068 like the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 as thou comest 935-2 unto Zoar. 6820
13:11 Then Lot 3876 chose 977-4 him all the plain 3603 of Jordan; 3383 and Lot 3876 journeyed 5265-4 east: 6924 and they separated 6504-11 themselves the one 376 from the other. 251
13:12 Abram 87 dwelled 3427-1 in the land 776 of Canaan, 3667 and Lot 3876 dwelled 3427-1 in the cities 5892 of the plain, 3603 and pitched [his] tent 167-4 toward 5704 Sodom. 5467
13:13 But the men 582 of Sodom 5467 [were] wicked 7451 and sinners 2400 before the LORD 3068 exceedingly. 3966
13:14 And the LORD 3068 said 559-1 unto Abram, 87 after 310 that Lot 3876 was separated 6504-9 from him, Lift up 5375-3 now thine eyes, 5869 and look 7200-3 from the place 4725 where thou art northward, 6828 and southward, 5045 and eastward, 6924 and westward: 3220
13:15 For all the land 776 which thou seest, 7200-6 to thee will I give 5414-4 it, and to thy seed 2233 for 5704 ever. 5769
13:16 And I will make 7760-1 thy seed 2233 as the dust 6083 of the earth: 776 so that 834 if a man 376 can 3201-4 number 4487-2 the dust 6083 of the earth, 776 [then] shall thy seed 2233 also be numbered. 4487-11
13:17 Arise, 6965-3 walk 1980-100 through the land 776 in the length 753 of it and in the breadth 7341 of it; for I will give 5414-4 it unto thee.
13:18 Then Abram 87 removed [his] tent, 167-4 and came 935-4 and dwelt 3427-4 in the plain 436 of Mamre, 4471 which [is] in Hebron, 2275 and built 1129-4 there an altar 4196 unto the LORD. 3068
14:1 And it came to pass in the days 3117 of Amraphel 569 king 4428 of Shinar, 8152 Arioch 746 king 4428 of Ellasar, 495 Chedorlaomer 3540 king 4428 of Elam, 5867 and Tidal 8413 king 4428 of nations; 1471
14:2 [That these] made 6213-1 war 4421 with 854 Bera 1298 king 4428 of Sodom, 5467 and with Birsha 1306 king 4428 of Gomorrah, 6017 Shinab 8134 king 4428 of Admah, 126 and Shemeber 8038 king 4428 of Zeboiim, 6636 and the king 4428 of Bela, 1106 which is 1931 Zoar. 6820
14:3 All these were joined together 2266-1 in the vale 6010 of Siddim, 7708 which is 1931 the salt 4417 sea. 3220
14:4 Twelve 6240 8147 years 8141 they served 5647-1 853 Chedorlaomer, 3540 and in the thirteenth 7969 6240 year 8141 they rebelled. 4775-1
14:5 And in the fourteenth 6240 702 year 8141 came 935-1 Chedorlaomer, 3540 and the kings 4428 that [were] with him, and smote 5221-55 the Rephaims 7497 in Ashteroth Karnaim, 6255 and the Zuzims 2104 in Ham, 1990 and the Emims 368 in Shaveh Kiriathaim, 7741
14:6 And the Horites 2752|2753 in their mount 2042 Seir, 8165 unto Elparan, 364 which [is] by 5921 the wilderness. 4057
14:7 And they returned, 7725-4 and came 935-4 to 413 Enmishpat, 5880 which [is] Kadesh, 6946 and smote 5221-55 all the country 7704 of the Amalekites, 6003 and also the Amorites, 567 that dwelt 3427-6 in Hazezontamar. 2688
14:8 And there went out 3318-4 the king 4428 of Sodom, 5467 and the king 4428 of Gomorrah, 6017 and the king 4428 of Admah, 126 and the king 4428 of Zeboiim, 6636 and the king 4428 of Bela 1106 (the same 1931 [is] Zoar;) 6820 and they joined 6186-4 battle 4421 with them in the vale 6010 of Siddim; 7708
14:9 With Chedorlaomer 3540 the king 4428 of Elam, 5867 and with Tidal 8413 king 4428 of nations, 1471 and Amraphel 569 king 4428 of Shinar, 8152 and Arioch 746 king 4428 of Ellasar; 495 four 702 kings 4428 with five. 2568
14:10 And the vale 6010 of Siddim 7708 [was full of] slimepits; 875 875 2564 and the kings 4428 of Sodom 5467 and Gomorrah 6017 fled, 5127-4 and fell 5307-4 there; and they that remained 7604-12 fled 5127-1 to the mountain. 2022
14:11 And they took 3947-4 all the goods 7399 of Sodom 5467 and Gomorrah, 6017 and all their victuals, 400 and went their way. 3212-4
14:12 And they took 3947-4 Lot, 3876 Abram's 87 brother's 251 son, 1121 who dwelt 3427-6 in Sodom, 5467 and his goods, 7399 and departed. 3212-4
14:13 And there came 935-4 one that had escaped, 6412 and told 5046-55 Abram 87 the Hebrew; 5680 for he dwelt 7931-6 in the plain 436 of Mamre 4471 the Amorite, 567 brother 251 of Eshcol, 812 and brother 251 of Aner: 6063 and these [were] confederate 1167 1285 with Abram. 87
14:14 And when Abram 87 heard 8085-4 that his brother 251 was taken captive, 7617-8 he armed 7324-55 his trained 2593 [servants], born 3211 in his own house, 1004 three 7969 hundred 3967 and eighteen, 6240 8083 and pursued 7291-4 [them] unto Dan. 1835
14:15 And he divided 2505-11 himself against them, he and his servants, 5650 by night, 3915 and smote 5221-55 them, and pursued 7291-4 them unto Hobah, 2327 which [is] on the left hand 8040 of Damascus. 1834
14:16 And he brought back 7725-55 all the goods, 7399 and also brought again 7725-52 his brother 251 Lot, 3876 and his goods, 7399 and the women 802 also, and the people. 5971
14:17 And the king 4428 of Sodom 5467 went out 3318-4 to meet 7125-2 him after 310 his return 7725-2 from the slaughter 5221-53 of Chedorlaomer, 3540 and of the kings 4428 that [were] with him, at the valley 6010 of Shaveh, 7740 which 1931 [is] the king's 4428 dale. 6010
14:18 And Melchizedek 4442 king 4428 of Salem 8004 brought forth 3318-52 bread 3899 and wine: 3196 and he [was] the priest 3548 of the most high 5945 God. 410
14:19 And he blessed 1288-17 him, and said, 559-4 Blessed 1288-7 [be] Abram 87 of the most high 5945 God, 410 possessor 7069-6 of heaven 8064 and earth: 776
14:20 And blessed 1288-7 be the most high 5945 God, 410 which hath delivered 4042-14 thine enemies 6862 into thy hand. 3027 And he gave 5414-4 him tithes 4643 of all.
14:21 And the king 4428 of Sodom 5467 said 559-4 unto Abram, 87 Give 5414-3 me the persons, 5315 and take 3947-3 the goods 7399 to thyself.
14:22 And Abram 87 said 559-4 to the king 4428 of Sodom, 5467 I have lift up 7311-52 mine hand 3027 unto the LORD, 3068 the most high 5945 God, 410 the possessor 7069-6 of heaven 8064 and earth, 776
14:23 That I will not 518 [take] from a thread 2339 even to a shoelatchet, 5275 8288 and that I will not 518 take 3947-4 any thing that [is] thine, lest thou shouldest say, 559-4 I have made Abram 87 rich: 6238-52
14:24 Save 1107 only that which 834 the young men 5288 have eaten, 398-1 and the portion 2506 of the men 582 which went 1980-1 with me, 854 Aner, 6063 Eshcol, 812 and Mamre; 4471 let them 1992 take 3947-4 their portion. 2506
15:1 After 310 these things 1697 the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came 1961-1 unto Abram 87 in a vision, 4236 saying, 559-2 Fear 3372-4 not, Abram: 87 I [am] thy shield, 4043 [and] thy exceeding 3966 great 7235-53 reward. 7939
15:2 And Abram 87 said, 559-4 Lord 136 GOD, 3069 what wilt thou give 5414-4 me, seeing I go 1980-6 childless, 6185 and the steward 1121 4943 of my house 1004 [is] this 1931 Eliezer 461 of Damascus? 1834
15:3 And Abram 87 said, 559-4 Behold, to me thou hast given 5414-1 no 3808 seed: 2233 and, lo, one born 1121 in my house 1004 is mine heir. 3423-6
15:4 And, behold, the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 [came] unto him, saying, 559-2 This shall not be thine heir; 3423-4 but he that shall come forth 3318-4 out of thine own bowels 4578 shall be thine heir. 3423-4
15:5 And he brought him forth 3318-55 abroad, 2351 and said, 559-4 Look 5027-54 now toward heaven, 8064 and tell 5608-3 the stars, 3556 if thou be able 3201-4 to number 5608-2 them: and he said 559-4 unto him, So 3541 shall thy seed 2233 be.
15:6 And he believed 539-52 in the LORD; 3068 and he counted 2803-4 it to him for righteousness. 6666
15:7 And he said 559-4 unto him, I [am] the LORD 3068 that brought thee out 3318-52 of Ur 218 of the Chaldees, 3778 to give 5414-2 thee this land 776 to inherit 3423-2 it.
15:8 And he said, 559-4 Lord 136 GOD, 3069 whereby 4100 shall I know 3045-4 that I shall inherit 3423-4 it?
15:9 And he said 559-4 unto him, Take 3947-3 me an heifer 5697 of three years old, 8027-30 and a she goat 5795 of three years old, 8027-30 and a ram 352 of three years old, 8027-30 and a turtledove, 8449 and a young pigeon. 1469
15:10 And he took 3947-4 unto him all these, and divided 1334-17 them in the midst, 8432 and laid 5414-4 each 376 piece 1335 one against 7125-2 another: 7453 but the birds 6833 divided 1334-1 he not.
15:11 And when the fowls 5861 came down 3381-4 upon the carcases, 6297 Abram 87 drove them away. 5380-55
15:12 And when the sun 8121 was going down, 935-2 a deep sleep 8639 fell 5307-1 upon Abram; 87 and, lo, an horror 367 of great 1419 darkness 2825 fell 5307-6 upon him.
15:13 And he said 559-4 unto Abram, 87 Know 3045-4 of a surety 3045-2 that thy seed 2233 shall be a stranger 1616 in a land 776 [that is] not theirs, and shall serve 5647-1 them; and they shall afflict 6031-14 them four 702 hundred 3967 years; 8141
15:14 And also that nation, 1471 whom they shall serve, 5647-4 will I judge: 1777-6 and afterward 310 3651 shall they come out 3318-4 with great 1419 substance. 7399
15:15 And thou shalt go 935-4 to thy fathers 1 in peace; 7965 thou shalt be buried 6912-11 in a good 2896 old age. 7872
15:16 But in the fourth 7243 generation 1755 they shall come hither 2008 again: 7725-4 for the iniquity 5771 of the Amorites 567 [is] not yet 2008 full. 8003
15:17 And it came to pass, that, when the sun 8121 went down, 935-1 and it was dark, 5939 behold a smoking 6227 furnace, 8574 and a burning 784 lamp 3940 that passed 5674-1 between 996 those pieces. 1506
15:18 In the same 1931 day 3117 the LORD 3068 made 3772-1 a covenant 1285 with Abram, 87 saying, 559-2 Unto thy seed 2233 have I given 5414-1 this land, 776 from the river 5104 of Egypt 4714 unto the great 1419 river, 5104 the river 5104 Euphrates: 6578
15:19 The Kenites, 7017 and the Kenizzites, 7074 and the Kadmonites, 6935
15:20 And the Hittites, 2850 and the Perizzites, 6522 and the Rephaims, 7497
15:21 And the Amorites, 567 and the Canaanites, 3669 and the Girgashites, 1622 and the Jebusites. 2983
16:1 Now Sarai 8297 Abram's 87 wife 802 bare 3205-1 him no 3808 children: and she had an handmaid, 8198 an Egyptian, 4713 whose name 8034 [was] Hagar. 1904
16:2 And Sarai 8297 said 559-4 unto Abram, 87 Behold now, the LORD 3068 hath restrained 6113-1 me from bearing: 3205-2 I pray thee, go in 935-3 unto my maid; 8198 it may be 194 that I may obtain children 1129-11 by her. And Abram 87 hearkened 8085-4 to the voice 6963 of Sarai. 8297
16:3 And Sarai 8297 Abram's 87 wife 802 took 3947-4 Hagar 1904 her maid 8198 the Egyptian, 4713 after 7093 Abram 87 had dwelt 3427-2 ten 6235 years 8141 in the land 776 of Canaan, 3667 and gave 5414-4 her to her husband 376 Abram 87 to be his wife. 802
16:4 And he went in 935-4 unto Hagar, 1904 and she conceived: 2029-4 and when she saw 7200-4 that she had conceived, 2029-1 her mistress 1404 was despised 7043-4 in her eyes. 5869
16:5 And Sarai 8297 said 559-4 unto Abram, 87 My wrong 2555 [be] upon thee: I have given 5414-1 my maid 8198 into thy bosom; 2436 and when she saw 7200-4 that she had conceived, 2029-1 I was despised 7043-4 in her eyes: 5869 the LORD 3068 judge 8199-4 between me and thee.
16:6 But Abram 87 said 559-4 unto Sarai, 8297 Behold, thy maid 8198 [is] in thy hand; 3027 do 6213-3 to her as it pleaseth 2896 thee. 5869 And when Sarai 8297 dealt hardly 6031-17 with her, she fled 1272-4 from her face. 6440
16:7 And the angel 4397 of the LORD 3068 found 4672-4 her by a fountain 5869 of water 4325 in the wilderness, 4057 by the fountain 5869 in the way 1870 to Shur. 7793
16:8 And he said, 559-4 Hagar, 1904 Sarai's 8297 maid, 8198 whence 335 camest 935-1 thou? and whither wilt thou go? 3212-4 And she said, 559-4 I flee 1272-6 from the face 6440 of my mistress 1404 Sarai. 8297
16:9 And the angel 4397 of the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto her, Return 7725-3 to thy mistress, 1404 and submit 6031-100 thyself under her hands. 3027
16:10 And the angel 4397 of the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto her, I will multiply 7235-55 thy seed 2233 exceedingly, 7235-53 that it shall not be numbered 5608-11 for multitude. 7230
16:11 And the angel 4397 of the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto her, Behold, 2009 thou [art] with child, 2030 and shalt bear 3205-6 a son, 1121 and shalt call 7121-1 his name 8034 Ishmael; 3458 because the LORD 3068 hath heard 8085-1 thy affliction. 6040
16:12 And he will be a wild 6501 man; 120 his hand 3027 [will be] against every man, and every man's hand 3027 against him; and he shall dwell 7931-4 in the presence 6440 of all his brethren. 251
16:13 And she called 7121-4 the name 8034 of the LORD 3068 that spake 1696-6 unto her, Thou God 410 seest me: 7210 for she said, 559-1 Have I also here 1988 looked 7200-1 after 310 him that seeth me? 7210
16:14 Wherefore the well 875 was called 7121-1 Beerlahairoi; 875|2416|7203|883 behold, [it is] between Kadesh 6946 and Bered. 1260
16:15 And Hagar 1904 bare 3205-4 Abram 87 a son: 1121 and Abram 87 called 7121-4 his son's 1121 name, 8034 which Hagar 1904 bare, 3205-1 Ishmael. 3458
16:16 And Abram 87 [was] fourscore 8084 8141 and six 8337 years 8141 old, 1121 when Hagar 1904 bare 3205-2 Ishmael 3458 to Abram. 87
17:1 And when Abram 87 was ninety 8673 8141 years 8141 old 1121 and nine, 8672 the LORD 3068 appeared 7200-11 to Abram, 87 and said 559-4 unto him, I [am] the Almighty 7706 God; 410 walk 1980-100 before 6440 me, and be thou perfect. 8549
17:2 And I will make 5414-4 my covenant 1285 between me and thee, and will multiply 7235-55 thee exceedingly. 3966 3966
17:3 And Abram 87 fell 5307-4 on his face: 6440 and God 430 talked 1696-17 with him, saying, 559-2
17:4 As for me, 589 behold, my covenant 1285 [is] with thee, and thou shalt be a father 1 of many 1995 nations. 1471
17:5 Neither shall thy name 8034 any more be called 7121-11 Abram, 87 but thy name 8034 shall be Abraham; 85 for a father 1 of many 1995 nations 1471 have I made 5414-1 thee.
17:6 And I will make thee exceeding 3966 3966 fruitful, 6509-52 and I will make 5414-1 nations 1471 of thee, and kings 4428 shall come out 3318-4 of thee.
17:7 And I will establish 6965-52 my covenant 1285 between me and thee and thy seed 2233 after 310 thee in their generations 1755 for an everlasting 5769 covenant, 1285 to be a God 430 unto thee, and to thy seed 2233 after 310 thee.
17:8 And I will give 5414-1 unto thee, and to thy seed 2233 after 310 thee, the land 776 wherein thou art a stranger, 4033 all the land 776 of Canaan, 3667 for an everlasting 5769 possession; 272 and I will be their God. 430
17:9 And God 430 said 559-4 unto Abraham, 85 Thou shalt keep 8104-4 my covenant 1285 therefore, thou, and thy seed 2233 after 310 thee in their generations. 1755
17:10 This [is] my covenant, 1285 which ye shall keep, 8104-4 between me and you and thy seed 2233 after 310 thee; Every man child 2145 among you shall be circumcised. 4135-9
17:11 And ye shall circumcise 5243-1 the flesh 1320 of your foreskin; 6190 and it shall be a token 226 of the covenant 1285 betwixt me and you.
17:12 And he that is eight 8083 days 3117 old 1121 shall be circumcised 4135-11 among you, every man child 2145 in your generations, 1755 he that is born 3211 in the house, 1004 or bought 4736 with money 3701 of any stranger, 1121 5236 which [is] not of thy seed. 2233
17:13 He that is born 3211 in thy house, 1004 and he that is bought 4736 with thy money, 3701 must needs 4135-9 be circumcised: 4135-11 and my covenant 1285 shall be in your flesh 1320 for an everlasting 5769 covenant. 1285
17:14 And the uncircumcised 6189 man child 2145 whose 834 flesh 1320 of his foreskin 6190 is not circumcised, 4135-11 that soul 5315 shall be cut off 3772-8 from his people; 5971 he hath broken 6565-52 my covenant. 1285
17:15 And God 430 said 559-4 unto Abraham, 85 As for Sarai 8297 thy wife, 802 thou shalt not call 7121-4 her name 8034 Sarai, 8297 but 3588 Sarah 8283 [shall] her name 8034 [be].
17:16 And I will bless 1288-14 her, and give 5414-1 thee a son 1121 also of her: yea, I will bless 1288-14 her, and she shall be [a mother] of nations; 1471 kings 4428 of people 5971 shall be of her.
17:17 Then Abraham 85 fell 5307-4 upon his face, 6440 and laughed, 6711-4 and said 559-4 in his heart, 3820 Shall [a child] be born 3205-11 unto him that is an hundred 3967 years 8141 old? 1121 and shall Sarah, 8283 that is ninety 8673 years 8141 old, 1323 bear? 3205-4
17:18 And Abraham 85 said 559-4 unto God, 430 O that 3863 Ishmael 3458 might live 2421-4 before 6440 thee!
17:19 And God 430 said, 559-4 Sarah 8283 thy wife 802 shall bear 3205-6 thee a son 1121 indeed; 61 and thou shalt call 7121-1 his name 8034 Isaac: 3327 and I will establish 6965-52 my covenant 1285 with him for an everlasting 5769 covenant, 1285 [and] with his seed 2233 after 310 him.
17:20 And as for Ishmael, 3458 I have heard 8085-1 thee: Behold, I have blessed 1288-14 him, and will make him fruitful, 6509-52 and will multiply 7235-52 him exceedingly; 3966 3966 twelve 6240 8147 princes 5387 shall he beget, 3205-55 and I will make 5414-1 him a great 1419 nation. 1471
17:21 But my covenant 1285 will I establish 6965-55 with Isaac, 3327 which Sarah 8283 shall bear 3205-4 unto thee at this set time 4150 in the next 312 year. 8141
17:22 And he left off 3615-17 talking 1696-15 with him, and God 430 went up 5927-4 from Abraham. 85
17:23 And Abraham 85 took 3947-4 Ishmael 3458 his son, 1121 and all that were born 3211 in his house, 1004 and all that were bought 4736 with his money, 3701 every male 2145 among the men 582 of Abraham's 85 house; 1004 and circumcised 4135-4 the flesh 1320 of their foreskin 6190 in the selfsame 6106 day, 3117 as God 430 had said 1696-14 unto him.
17:24 And Abraham 85 [was] ninety 8673 years 8141 old 1121 and nine, 8672 when he was circumcised 4135-9 in the flesh 1320 of his foreskin. 6190
17:25 And Ishmael 3458 his son 1121 [was] thirteen 6240 7969 years 8141 old, 1121 when he was circumcised 4135-9 in the flesh 1320 of his foreskin. 6190
17:26 In the selfsame 6106 day 3117 was Abraham 85 circumcised, 4135-8 and Ishmael 3458 his son. 1121
17:27 And all the men 582 of his house, 1004 born 3211 in the house, 1004 and bought 4736 with money 3701 of the stranger, 1121 5236 were circumcised 4135-8 with him.
18:1 And the LORD 3068 appeared 7200-11 unto him in the plains 436 of Mamre: 4471 and he sat 3427-6 in the tent 168 door 6607 in the heat 2527 of the day; 3117
18:2 And he lift up 5375-4 his eyes 5869 and looked, 7200-4 and, lo, three 7969 men 582 stood 5324-12 by him: and when he saw 7200-4 [them], he ran 7323-4 to meet 7125-2 them from the tent 168 door, 6607 and bowed 7812-101 himself toward the ground, 776
18:3 And said, 559-4 My Lord, 136 if now I have found 4672-1 favour 2580 in thy sight, 5869 pass not away, 5674-4 I pray thee, from thy servant: 5650
18:4 Let a little 4592 water, 4325 I pray you, 4994 be fetched, 3947-93 and wash 7364-3 your feet, 7272 and rest 8172-10 yourselves under the tree: 6086
18:5 And I will fetch 3947-4 a morsel 6595 of bread, 3899 and comfort 5582-3 ye your hearts; 3820 after 310 that ye shall pass on: 5674-4 for therefore are ye come 5674-1 to 5921 your servant. 5650 And they said, 559-4 So do, 6213-4 as thou hast said. 1696-14
18:6 And Abraham 85 hastened 4116-17 into the tent 168 unto Sarah, 8283 and said, 559-4 Make ready quickly 4116-16 three 7969 measures 5429 of fine 5560 meal, 7058 knead 3888-3 [it], and make 6213-3 cakes 5692 upon the hearth.
18:7 And Abraham 85 ran 7323-1 unto the herd, 1241 and fetcht 3947-4 a calf 1121 1241 tender 7390 and good, 2896 and gave 5414-4 [it] unto a young man; 5288 and he hasted 4116-17 to dress 6213-2 it.
18:8 And he took 3947-4 butter, 2529 and milk, 2461 and the calf 1121 1241 which he had dressed, 6213-1 and set 5414-4 [it] before 6440 them; and he stood 5975-6 by them under the tree, 6086 and they did eat. 398-4
18:9 And they said 559-4 unto him, Where 346 [is] Sarah 8283 thy wife? 802 And he said, 559-4 Behold, in the tent. 168
18:10 And he said, 559-4 I will certainly 7725-2 return 7725-4 unto thee according to the time 6256 of life; 2416 and, lo, Sarah 8283 thy wife 802 shall have a son. 1121 And Sarah 8283 heard 8085-6 [it] in the tent 168 door, 6607 which [was] behind 310 him.
18:11 Now Abraham 85 and Sarah 8283 [were] old 2205 [and] well stricken 935-6 in age; 3117 [and] it ceased 2308-1 to be with Sarah 8283 after the manner 734 of women. 802
18:12 Therefore Sarah 8283 laughed 6711-4 within 7130 herself, saying, 559-2 After 310 I am waxed old 1086-2 shall I have pleasure, 5730 my lord 113 being old 2204-1 also?
18:13 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Abraham, 85 Wherefore 4100 did Sarah 8283 laugh, 6711-1 saying, 559-2 Shall I of a surety 552 bear 3205-4 a child, which 589 am old? 2204-1
18:14 Is any thing 1697 too hard 6381-11 for the LORD? 3068 At the time appointed 4150 I will return 7725-4 unto thee, according to the time 6256 of life, 2416 and Sarah 8283 shall have a son. 1121
18:15 Then Sarah 8283 denied, 3584-17 saying, 559-2 I laughed 6711-1 not; for she was afraid. 3372-1 And he said, 559-4 Nay; 3808 but thou didst laugh. 6711-1
18:16 And the men 582 rose up 6965-4 from thence, and looked 8259-55 toward 6440 Sodom: 5467 and Abraham 85 went 1980-6 with them to bring them on the way. 7971-15
18:17 And the LORD 3068 said, 559-1 Shall I hide 3680-18 from Abraham 85 that thing which 834 I do; 6213-6
18:18 Seeing that Abraham 85 shall surely become a great 1419 and mighty 6099 nation, 1471 and all the nations 1471 of the earth 776 shall be blessed 1288-8 in him?
18:19 For I know 3045-1 him, that 834 he will command 6680-17 his children 1121 and his household 1004 after 310 him, and they shall keep 8104-1 the way 1870 of the LORD, 3068 to do 6213-2 justice 6666 and judgment; 4941 that the LORD 3068 may bring 935-53 upon Abraham 85 that which he hath spoken 1696-14 of him.
18:20 And the LORD 3068 said, 559-4 Because the cry 2201 of Sodom 5467 and Gomorrah 6017 is great, 7227 and because their sin 2403 is very 3966 grievous; 3513-1
18:21 I will go down 3381-4 now, and see 7200-4 whether they have done 6213-1 altogether 3617 according to the cry 6818 of it, which is come 935-6 unto me; and if not, I will know. 3045-4
18:22 And the men 582 turned their faces 6437-4 from thence, and went 3212-4 toward Sodom: 5467 but Abraham 85 stood 5975-6 yet 5750 before 6440 the LORD. 3068
18:23 And Abraham 85 drew near, 5066-4 and said, 559-4 Wilt thou also destroy 5595-4 the righteous 6662 with 5973 the wicked? 7563
18:24 Peradventure there be 3426 fifty 2572 righteous 6662 within 8432 the city: 5892 wilt thou also destroy 5595-4 and not spare 5375-4 the place 4725 for 4616 the fifty 2572 righteous 6662 that [are] therein? 7130
18:25 That be far 2486 from thee to do 6213-2 after this manner, 1697 to slay 4191-53 the righteous 6662 with the wicked: 7563 and that the righteous 6662 should be as the wicked, 7563 that be far 2486 from thee: Shall not the Judge 8199-6 of all the earth 776 do 6213-4 right? 4941
18:26 And the LORD 3068 said, 559-4 If I find 4672-4 in Sodom 5467 fifty 2572 righteous 6662 within 8432 the city, 5892 then I will spare 5375-1 all the place 4725 for their sakes.
18:27 And Abraham 85 answered 6030-4 and said, 559-4 Behold now, I have taken upon me 2974-52 to speak 1696-15 unto the Lord, 136 which 595 [am but] dust 6083 and ashes: 665
18:28 Peradventure there shall lack 2637-4 five 2568 of the fifty 2572 righteous: 66 2 wilt thou destroy 7843-55 all the city 5892 for [lack of] five? 2568 And he said, 559-4 If I find 4672-4 there forty 705 and five, 2568 I will not destroy 7843-55 [it].
18:29 And he spake 1696-15 unto him yet again, 3254-55 and said, 559-4 Peradventure there shall be forty 705 found 4672-11 there. And he said, 559-4 I will not do 6213-4 [it] for forty's 705 sake.
18:30 And he said 559-4 [unto him], Oh 4994 let not the Lord 136 be angry, 2734-4 and I will speak: 1696-17 Peradventure there shall thirty 7970 be found 4672-11 there. And he said, 559-4 I will not do 6213-4 [it], if I find 4672-4 thirty 7970 there.
18:31 And he said, 559-4 Behold now, I have taken upon me 2974-52 to speak 1696-15 unto the Lord: 136 Peradventure there shall be twenty 6242 found 4672-11 there. And he said, 559-4 I will not destroy 7843-55 [it] for twenty's 6242 sake.
18:32 And he said, 559-4 Oh let not the Lord 136 be angry, 2734-4 and I will speak 1696-17 yet but 389 this once: 6471 Peradventure ten 6235 shall be found 4672-11 there. And he said, 559-4 I will not destroy 7843-55 [it] for ten's 6235 sake.
18:33 And the LORD 3068 went his way, 3212-4 as soon as 834 he had left 3615-14 communing 1696-15 with Abraham: 85 and Abraham 85 returned 7725-1 unto his place. 4725
19:1 And there came 935-4 two 8147 angels 4397 to Sodom 5467 at even; 6153 and Lot 3876 sat 3427-6 in the gate 8179 of Sodom: 5467 and Lot 3876 seeing 7200-4 [them] rose up 6965-4 to meet 7125-2 them; and he bowed 7812-101 himself with his face 639 toward the ground; 776
19:2 And he said, 559-4 Behold now, my lords, 113 turn in, 5493-3 I pray you, into your servant's 5650 house, 1004 and tarry all night, 3885-3 and wash 7364-3 your feet, 7272 and ye shall rise up early, 7925-52 and go 1980-1 on your ways. 1870 And they said, 559-4 Nay; but we will abide in the street 7339 all night. 3885-4
19:3 And he pressed 6484-4 upon them greatly; 3966 and they turned in 5493-4 unto him, and entered 935-4 into his house; 1004 and he made 6213-4 them a feast, 4960 and did bake 644-1 unleavened bread, 4682 and they did eat. 398-4
19:4 But before they lay down, 7901-4 the men 582 of the city, 5892 [even] the men 582 of Sodom, 5467 compassed the house 1004 round, 5437-8 both old 2205 and young, 5288 all the people 5971 from every quarter: 7097
19:5 And they called 7121-4 unto Lot, 3876 and said 559-4 unto him, Where [are] the men 582 which came in 935-1 to thee this night? 3915 bring them out 3318-54 unto us, that we may know 3045-4 them.
19:6 And Lot 3876 went out 3318-4 at the door 6607 unto them, and shut 5462-1 the door 1817 after 310 him,
19:7 And said, 559-4 I pray you, brethren, 251 do not so wickedly. 7489-55
19:8 Behold now, I have two 8147 daughters 1323 which have not known 3045-1 man; 376 let me, I pray you, bring them out 3318-55 unto you, and do 6213-3 ye to them as [is] good 2896 in your eyes: 5869 only unto these 411 men 582 do 6213-4 nothing; 408 1697 for therefore came 935-1 they under the shadow 6738 of my roof. 6982
19:9 And they said, 559-4 Stand 5066-3 back. 1973 And they said 559-4 [again], This one 259 [fellow] came in 935-1 to sojourn, 1481-2 and he will needs 8199-2 be a judge: 8199-4 now will we deal worse 7489-55 with thee, than with them. And they pressed 6484-4 sore 3966 upon the man, 376 [even] Lot, 3876 and came near 5066-4 to break 7665-2 the door. 1817
19:10 But the men 582 put forth 7971-4 their hand, 3027 and pulled 935-55 Lot 3876 into the house 1004 to them, and shut 5462-1 to the door. 1817
19:11 And they smote 5221-52 the men 582 that [were] at the door 6607 of the house 1004 with blindness, 5575 both small 6996 and great: 1419 so that they wearied 3811-4 themselves to find 4672-2 the door. 6607
19:12 And the men 582 said 559-4 unto Lot, 3876 Hast thou here 6311 any 4310 besides? son in law, 2860 and thy sons, 1121 and thy daughters, 1323 and whatsoever 834 thou hast in the city, 5892 bring [them] out 3318-54 of this place: 4725
19:13 For we 587 will destroy 7843-56 853 this place, 4725 because the cry 6818 of them is waxen great 1431-1 before 854 the face 6440 of the LORD; 3068 and the LORD 3068 hath sent 7971-17 us to destroy 7843-15 it.
19:14 And Lot 3876 went out, 3318-4 and spake 1696-17 unto his sons in law, 2860 which married 3947-6 his daughters, 1323 and said, 559-4 Up, 6965-3 get you out 3318-3 of this place; 4725 for the LORD 3068 will destroy 7843-56 this city. 5892 But he seemed as one that mocked 6711-18 unto 5869 his sons in law. 2860
19:15 And when 3644 the morning 7837 arose, 5927-1 then the angels 4397 hastened 213-55 Lot, 3876 saying, 559-2 Arise, 6965-3 take 3947-3 thy wife, 802 and thy two 8147 daughters, 1323 which are here; 4672-12 lest thou be consumed 5595-11 in the iniquity 5771 of the city. 5892
19:16 And while he lingered, 4102-118 the men 582 laid hold 2388-55 upon his hand, 3027 and upon the hand 3027 of his wife, 802 and upon the hand 3027 of his two 8147 daughters; 1323 the LORD 3068 being merciful 2551 unto him: and they brought him forth, 3318-55 and set him 3240-55 without 2351 the city. 5892
19:17 And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth 3318-53 abroad, 2351 that he said, 559-4 Escape 4422-10 for 5921 thy life; 5315 look 5027-55 not behind 310 thee, neither stay 5975-4 thou in all the plain; 3603 escape 4422-10 to the mountain, 2022 lest thou be consumed. 5595-11
19:18 And Lot 3876 said 559-4 unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord: 113
19:19 Behold now, thy servant 5650 hath found 4672-1 grace 2580 in thy sight, 5869 and thou hast magnified 1431-55 thy mercy, 2617 which thou hast shewed 6213-1 unto me 5978 in saving 2421-53 my life; 5315 and I cannot 3808 3201-4 escape 4422-9 to the mountain, 2022 lest some evil 7451 take 1692-4 me, and I die: 4191-1
19:20 Behold now, this city 5892 [is] near 7138 to flee 5127-2 unto, and it 1931 [is] a little one: 4705 Oh, let me escape 4422-11 thither, ([is] it not a little one?) 4705 and my soul 5315 shall live. 2421-4
19:21 And he said 559-4 unto him, See, 2009 I have accepted 5375-1 thee 6440 concerning this thing 1697 also, that I will not overthrow 2015-2 this city, 5892 for the which 834 thou hast spoken. 1696-14
19:22 Haste 4116-16 thee, escape 4422-10 thither; for I cannot 3808 3201-4 do 6213-2 any thing 1697 till thou be come 935-2 thither. Therefore the name 8034 of the city 5892 was called 7121-1 Zoar. 6820
19:23 The sun 8121 was risen 3318-1 upon the earth 776 when Lot 3876 entered 935-1 into Zoar. 6820
19:24 Then the LORD 3068 rained 4305-52 upon Sodom 5467 and upon Gomorrah 6017 brimstone 1614 and fire 784 from the LORD 3068 out of heaven; 8064
19:25 And he overthrew 2015-4 those 411 cities, 5892 and all the plain, 3603 and all the inhabitants 3427-6 of the cities, 5892 and that which grew 6780 upon the ground. 127
19:26 But his wife 802 looked 5027-55 back from behind 310 him, and she became a pillar 5333 of salt. 4417
19:27 And Abraham 85 gat up early 7925-55 in the morning 1242 to the place 4725 where he stood 5975-1 before 6440 the LORD: 3068
19:28 And he looked 8259-55 toward 6440 Sodom 5467 and Gomorrah, 6017 and toward 6440 all the land 776 of the plain, 3603 and beheld, 7200-4 and, lo, the smoke 7008 of the country 776 went up 5927-1 as the smoke 7008 of a furnace. 3536
19:29 And it came to pass, when God 430 destroyed 7843-15 the cities 5892 of the plain, 3603 that God 430 remembered 2142-4 Abraham, 85 and sent 7971-17 Lot 3876 out of the midst 8432 of the overthrow, 2018 when he overthrew 2015-2 the cities 5892 in the which 2004 Lot 3876 dwelt. 3427-1
19:30 And Lot 3876 went up 5927-4 out of Zoar, 6820 and dwelt 3427-4 in the mountain, 2022 and his two 8147 daughters 1323 with him; for he feared 3372-1 to dwell 3427-2 in Zoar: 6820 and he dwelt 3427-4 in a cave, 4631 he and his two 8147 daughters. 1323
19:31 And the firstborn 1067 said 559-4 unto the younger, 6810 Our father 1 [is] old, 2204-1 and [there is] not a man 376 in the earth 776 to come in 935-2 unto us after the manner 1870 of all the earth: 776
19:32 Come, 3212-3 let us make our father 1 drink 8248-55 wine, 3196 and we will lie 7901-4 with him, that we may preserve 2421-17 seed 2233 of our father. 1
19:33 And they made their father 1 drink 8248-55 wine 3196 that night: 3915 and the firstborn 1067 went in, 935-4 and lay 7901-4 with her father; 1 and he perceived 3045-1 not when she lay down, 7901-2 nor when she arose. 6965-2
19:34 And it came to pass on the morrow, 4283 that the firstborn 1067 said 559-4 unto the younger, 6810 Behold, I lay 7901-1 yesternight 570 with my father: 1 let us make him drink 8248-55 wine 3196 this night 3915 also; and go thou in, 935-3 [and] lie 7901-3 with him, that we may preserve 2421-17 seed 2233 of our father. 1
19:35 And they made their father 1 drink 8248-55 wine 3196 that 1931 night 3915 also: and the younger 6810 arose, 6965-4 and lay 7901-4 with him; and he perceived 3045-1 not when she lay down, 7901-2 nor when she arose. 6965-2
19:36 Thus were both 8147 the daughters 1323 of Lot 3876 with child 2029-4 by their father. 1
19:37 And the firstborn 1067 bare 3205-4 a son, 1121 and called 7121-4 his name 8034 Moab: 4124 the same 1931 [is] the father 1 of the Moabites 4124 unto this day. 3117
19:38 And the younger, 6810 she also bare 3205-1 a son, 1121 and called 7121-4 his name 8034 Benammi: 1151 the same [is] the father 1 of the children 1121 of Ammon 5983 unto this day. 3117
20:1 And Abraham 85 journeyed 5265-4 from thence toward the south 5045 country, 776 and dwelled 3427-4 between Kadesh 6946 and Shur, 7793 and sojourned 1481-4 in Gerar. 1642
20:2 And Abraham 85 said 559-4 of 413 Sarah 8283 his wife, 802 She [is] my sister: 269 and Abimelech 40 king 4428 of Gerar 1642 sent, 7971-4 and took 3947-4 Sarah. 8283
20:3 But God 430 came 935-4 to Abimelech 40 in a dream 2472 by night, 3915 and said 559-4 to him, Behold, thou [art but] a dead man, 4191-5 for the woman 802 which thou hast taken; 3947-1 for she [is] a man's 1167 wife. 1166-7
20:4 But Abimelech 40 had not come near 7126-1 her: and he said, 559-4 Lord, 136 wilt thou slay 2026-4 also a righteous 6662 nation? 1471
20:5 Said 559-1 he not unto me, She 1931 [is] my sister? 269 and she, 1931 even 1571 she herself 1931 said, 559-1 He [is] my brother: 251 in the integrity 8537 of my heart 3824 and innocency 5356 of my hands 3709 have I done 6213-1 this.
20:6 And God 430 said 559-4 unto him in a dream, 2472 Yea, 1571 I know 3045-1 that thou didst 6213-1 this in the integrity 8537 of thy heart; 3824 for I also withheld 2820-4 thee from sinning 2398-2 against me: therefore suffered 5414-1 I thee not to touch 5060-2 her.
20:7 Now therefore restore 7725-54 the man 376 [his] wife; 802 for he [is] a prophet, 5030 and he shall pray 6419-101 for thee, 1157 and thou shalt live: 2421-3 and if thou restore 7725-56 [her] not, know 3045-3 thou that thou shalt surely 4191-2 die, 4191-4 thou, and all that [are] thine.
20:8 Therefore Abimelech 40 rose early 7925-55 in the morning, 1242 and called 7121-4 all his servants, 5650 and told 1696-17 all these things 1697 in their ears: 241 and the men 582 were sore 3966 afraid. 3372-4
20:9 Then Abimelech 40 called 7121-4 Abraham, 85 and said 559-4 unto him, What hast thou done 6213-1 unto us? and what have I offended 2398-1 thee, that thou hast brought 935-52 on me and on my kingdom 4467 a great 1419 sin? 2401 thou hast done 6213-1 deeds 4639 unto me that ought not to be done. 6213-11
20:10 And Abimelech 40 said 559-4 unto Abraham, 85 What 4100 sawest 7200-1 thou, that thou hast done 6213-1 this thing? 1697
20:11 And Abraham 85 said, 559-4 Because I thought, 559-1 Surely 7535 the fear 3374 of God 430 [is] not in this place; 4725 and they will slay me 2026-1 for my wife's 802 sake. 1697
20:12 And yet indeed 546 [she is] my sister; 269 she [is] the daughter 1323 of my father, 1 but not the daughter 1323 of my mother; 517 and she became my wife. 802
20:13 And it came to pass, when God 430 caused me to wander 8582-52 from my father's 1 house, 1004 that I said 559-4 unto her, This [is] thy kindness 2617 which thou shalt shew 6213-4 unto me; at every place 4725 whither we shall come, 935-4 say 559-3 of me, He [is] my brother. 251
20:14 And Abimelech 40 took 3947-4 sheep, 6629 and oxen, 1241 and menservants, 5650 and womenservants, 8198 and gave 5414-4 [them] unto Abraham, 85 and restored 7725-55 him Sarah 8283 his wife. 802
20:15 And Abimelech 40 said, 559-4 Behold, my land 776 [is] before 6440 thee: dwell 3427-3 where it pleaseth 2896 thee. 5869
20:16 And unto Sarah 8283 he said, 559-1 Behold, I have given 5414-1 thy brother 251 a thousand 505 [pieces] of silver: 3701 behold, he [is] to thee a covering 3682 of the eyes, 5869 unto all that [are] with thee, and with all [other]: thus she was reproved. 3198-12
20:17 So Abraham 85 prayed 6419-101 unto God: 430 and God 430 healed 7495-4 Abimelech, 40 and his wife, 802 and his maidservants; 519 and they bare 3205-4 [children].
20:18 For the LORD 3068 had fast 6113-2 closed up 6113-1 all the wombs 7358 of the house 1004 of Abimelech, 40 because 1697 of Sarah 8283 Abraham's 85 wife. 802
21:1 And the LORD 3068 visited 6485-1 Sarah 8283 as he had said, 559-1 and the LORD 3068 did 6213-4 unto Sarah 8283 as he had spoken. 1696-14
21:2 For Sarah 8283 conceived, 2029-4 and bare 3205-4 Abraham 85 a son 1121 in his old age, 2208 at the set time 4150 of which God 430 had spoken 1696-14 to him.
21:3 And Abraham 85 called 7121-4 the name 8034 of his son 1121 that was born 3205-12 unto him, whom Sarah 8283 bare 3205-1 to him, Isaac. 3327
21:4 And Abraham 85 circumcised 4135-4 his son 1121 Isaac 3327 being eight 8083 days 3117 old, 1121 as God 430 had commanded 6680-14 him.
21:5 And Abraham 85 was an hundred 3967 years 8141 old, 1121 when his son 1121 Isaac 3327 was born 3205-9 unto him.
21:6 And Sarah 8283 said, 559-4 God 430 hath made 6213-1 me to laugh, 6712 [so that] all that hear 8085-6 will laugh 6711-4 with me.
21:7 And she said, 559-4 Who would have said 4448-14 unto Abraham, 85 that Sarah 8283 should have given children 1121 suck? 3243-52 for I have born 3205-1 [him] a son 1121 in his old age. 2208
21:8 And the child 3206 grew, 1431-4 and was weaned: 1580-11 and Abraham 85 made 6213-4 a great 1419 feast 4960 the [same] day 3117 that Isaac 3327 was weaned. 1580-9
21:9 And Sarah 8283 saw 7200-4 the son 1121 of Hagar 1904 the Egyptian, 4713 which she had born 3205-1 unto Abraham, 85 mocking. 6711-18
21:10 Wherefore she said 559-4 unto Abraham, 85 Cast out 1644-16 this bondwoman 519 and her son: 1121 for the son 1121 of this bondwoman 519 shall not be heir 3423-4 with my son, 1121 [even] with Isaac. 3327
21:11 And the thing 1697 was very 3966 grievous 3415-4 in Abraham's 85 sight 5869 because 182 of his son. 1121
21:12 And God 430 said 559-4 unto Abraham, 85 Let it not be grievous 3415-4 in thy sight 5869 because of the lad, 5288 and because of thy bondwoman; 519 in all that Sarah 8283 hath said 559-4 unto thee, hearken 8085-3 unto her voice; 6963 for in Isaac 3327 shall thy seed 2233 be called. 7121-11
21:13 And also of the son 1121 of the bondwoman 519 will I make 7760-4 a nation, 1471 because he [is] thy seed. 2233
21:14 And Abraham 85 rose up early 7925-55 in the morning, 1242 and took 3947-4 bread, 3899 and a bottle 2573 of water, 4325 and gave 5414-4 [it] unto Hagar, 1904 putting 7760-1 [it] on her shoulder, 7926 and the child, 3206 and sent her away: 7971-17 and she departed, 3212-4 and wandered 8582-4 in the wilderness 4057 of Beersheba. 884
21:15 And the water 4325 was spent 3615-4 in 4480 the bottle, 2573 and she cast 7993-55 the child 3206 under one 259 of the shrubs. 7880
21:16 And she went, 3212-4 and sat her down 3427-4 over against 5048 [him] a good way off, 7368-53 as it were a bowshot: 2909-18 7198 for she said, 559-1 Let me not see 7200-4 the death 4194 of the child. 3206 And she sat 3427-4 over against [him], and lift up 5375-4 her voice, 6963 and wept. 1058-4
21:17 And God 430 heard 8085-4 the voice 6963 of the lad; 5288 and the angel 4397 of God 430 called 7121-4 to Hagar 1904 out of heaven, 8064 and said 559-4 unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? 1904 fear 3372-4 not; for God 430 hath heard 8085-1 the voice 6963 of the lad 5288 where he [is].
21:18 Arise, 6965-3 lift up 5375-3 the lad, 5288 and hold 2388-54 him in thine hand; 3027 for I will make 7760-4 him a great 1419 nation. 1471
21:19 And God 430 opened 6491-4 her eyes, 5869 and she saw 7200-4 a well 875 of water; 4325 and she went, 3212-4 and filled 4390-17 the bottle 2573 with water, 4325 and gave the lad 5288 drink. 8248-55
21:20 And God 430 was with the lad; 5288 and he grew, 1431-4 and dwelt 3427-4 in the wilderness, 4057 and became an archer. 7235-6 7199
21:21 And he dwelt 3427-4 in the wilderness 4057 of Paran: 6290 and his mother 517 took 3947-4 him a wife 802 out of the land 776 of Egypt. 4714
21:22 And it came to pass at that time, 6256 that Abimelech 40 and Phichol 6369 the chief captain 8269 of his host 6635 spake 559-4 unto Abraham, 85 saying, 559-2 God 430 [is] with thee in all that thou doest: 6213-6
21:23 Now therefore swear 7650-10 unto me here 2008 by God 430 that thou wilt not deal falsely 8266-4 with me, nor with my son, 5209 nor with my son's son: 5220 [but] according to the kindness 2617 that I have done 6213-1 unto thee, thou shalt do 6213-4 unto me, and to the land 776 wherein thou hast sojourned. 1481-1
21:24 And Abraham 85 said, 559-4 I will swear. 7650-11
21:25 And Abraham 85 reproved 3198-52 Abimelech 40 because 182 of a well 875 of water, 4325 which Abimelech's 40 servants 5650 had violently taken away. 1497-1
21:26 And Abimelech 40 said, 559-4 I wot 3045-1 not who hath done 6213-1 this thing: 1697 neither 3808 didst thou tell 5046-52 me, neither 3808 yet heard 8085-1 I [of it], but 1115 to day. 3117
21:27 And Abraham 85 took 3947-4 sheep 6629 and oxen, 1241 and gave 5414-4 them unto Abimelech; 40 and both 8147 of them made 3772-4 a covenant. 1285
21:28 And Abraham 85 set 5324-55 seven 7651 ewe lambs 3535 of the flock 6629 by themselves.
21:29 And Abimelech 40 said 559-4 unto Abraham, 85 What 2008 [mean] these seven 7651 ewe lambs 3535 which thou hast set 5324-52 by themselves?
21:30 And he said, 559-4 For [these] seven 7651 ewe lambs 3535 shalt thou take 3947-4 of my hand, 3027 that 5668 they may be a witness 5713 unto me, that I have digged 2658-1 this well. 875
21:31 Wherefore he called 7121-1 that place 4725 Beersheba; 884 because there they sware 7650-8 both 8147 of them.
21:32 Thus they made 3772-4 a covenant 1285 at Beersheba: 884 then Abimelech 40 rose up, 6965-4 and Phichol 6369 the chief captain 8269 of his host, 6635 and they returned 7725-4 into the land 776 of the Philistines. 6430
21:33 And [Abraham] planted 5193-4 a grove 815 in Beersheba, 884 and called 7121-4 there on the name 8034 of the LORD, 3068 the everlasting 5769 God. 410
21:34 And Abraham 85 sojourned 1481-4 in the Philistines' 6430 land 776 many 7227 days. 3117
22:1 And it came to pass after 310 these things, 1697 that God 430 did tempt 5254-14 Abraham, 85 and said 559-4 unto him, Abraham: 85 and he said, 559-4 Behold, [here] I [am].
22:2 And he said, 559-4 Take 3947-3 now thy son, 1121 thine only 3173 [son] Isaac, 3327 whom thou lovest, 157-1 and get 3212-3 thee into the land 776 of Moriah; 4179 and offer 5927-54 him there for a burnt offering 5930 upon one 259 of the mountains 2022 which I will tell 559-4 thee of.
22:3 And Abraham 85 rose up early 7925-55 in the morning, 1242 and saddled 2280-4 his ass, 2543 and took 3947-4 two 8147 of his young men 5288 with him, and Isaac 3327 his son, 1121 and clave 1234-17 the wood 6086 for the burnt offering, 5930 and rose up, 6965-4 and went 3212-4 unto the place 4725 of which God 430 had told 559-1 him.
22:4 Then on the third 7992 day 3117 Abraham 85 lifted up 5375-4 his eyes, 5869 and saw 7200-4 the place 4725 afar off. 7350
22:5 And Abraham 85 said 559-4 unto his young men, 5288 Abide 3427-3 ye here with the ass; 2543 and I and the lad 5288 will go 3212-4 yonder 3541 and worship, 7812-101 and come again 7725-4 to you.
22:6 And Abraham 85 took 3947-4 the wood 6086 of the burnt offering, 5930 and laid 7760-4 [it] upon Isaac 3327 his son; 1121 and he took 3947-4 the fire 784 in his hand, 3027 and a knife; 3979 and they went 3212-4 both 8147 of them together. 3162
22:7 And Isaac 3327 spake 559-4 unto Abraham 85 his father, 1 and said, 559-4 My father: 1 and he said, 559-4 Here [am] I, my son. 1121 And he said, 559-4 Behold the fire 784 and the wood: 6086 but where [is] the lamb 7716 for a burnt offering? 5930
22:8 And Abraham 85 said, 559-4 My son, 1121 God 430 will provide 7200-4 himself a lamb 7716 for a burnt offering: 5930 so they went 3212-4 both 8147 of them together. 3162
22:9 And they came 935-4 to the place 4725 which God 430 had told 559-1 him of; and Abraham 85 built 1129-4 an altar 4196 there, and laid the wood 6086 in order, 6186-4 and bound 6123-4 Isaac 3327 his son, 1121 and laid 7760-4 him on the altar 4196 upon 4605 the wood. 6086
22:10 And Abraham 85 stretched forth 7971-4 his hand, 3027 and took 3947-4 the knife 3979 to slay 7819-2 his son. 1121
22:11 And the angel 4397 of the LORD 3068 called 7121-4 unto him out of heaven, 8064 and said, 559-4 Abraham, 85 Abraham: 85 and he said, 559-4 Here [am] I.
22:12 And he said, 559-4 Lay 7971-4 not thine hand 3027 upon 413 the lad, 5288 neither do 6213-4 thou any thing 3972 unto him: for now 6258 I know 3045-1 that thou fearest 3373 God, 430 seeing thou hast not 3808 withheld 2820-1 thy son, 1121 thine only 3173 [son] from me.
22:13 And Abraham 85 lifted up 5375-4 his eyes, 5869 and looked, 7200-4 and behold behind 310 [him] a ram 352 caught 270-12 in a thicket 5442 by his horns: 7161 and Abraham 85 went 3212-4 and took 3947-4 the ram, 352 and offered him up 5927-55 for a burnt offering 5930 in the stead 8478 of his son. 1121
22:14 And Abraham 85 called 7121-4 the name 8034 of that place 4725 Jehovahjireh: 3068|7200-4|3070 as 834 it is said 559-11 [to] this day, 3117 In the mount 2022 of the LORD 3068 it shall be seen. 7200-11
22:15 And the angel 4397 of the LORD 3068 called 7121-4 unto Abraham 85 out of heaven 8064 the second time, 8145
22:16 And said, 559-4 By myself have I sworn, 7650-8 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 for because 3282 834 thou hast done 6213-1 this thing, 1697 and hast not 3808 withheld 2820-1 thy son, 1121 thine only 3173 [son]:
22:17 That in blessing 1288-15 I will bless 1288-17 thee, and in multiplying 7235-53 I will multiply 7235-55 thy seed 2233 as the stars 3556 of the heaven, 8064 and as the sand 2344 which [is] upon the sea 3220 shore; 8193 and thy seed 2233 shall possess 3423-4 the gate 8179 of his enemies; 341-6
22:18 And in thy seed 2233 shall all the nations 1471 of the earth 776 be blessed; 1288-98 because 834 6118 thou hast obeyed 8085-1 my voice. 6963
22:19 So Abraham 85 returned 7725-4 unto his young men, 5288 and they rose up 6965-4 and went 3212-4 together 3162 to Beersheba; 884 and Abraham 85 dwelt 3427-4 at Beersheba. 884
22:20 And it came to pass after 310 these things, 1697 that it was told 5046-93 Abraham, 85 saying, 559-2 Behold, Milcah, 4435 she hath also born 3205-1 children 1121 unto thy brother 251 Nahor; 5152
22:21 Huz 5780 his firstborn, 1060 and Buz 938 his brother, 251 and Kemuel 7055 the father 1 of Aram, 758
22:22 And Chesed, 3777 and Hazo, 2375 and Pildash, 6394 and Jidlaph, 3044 and Bethuel. 1328
22:23 And Bethuel 1328 begat 3205-1 Rebekah: 7259 these eight 8083 Milcah 4435 did bear 3205-1 to Nahor, 5152 Abraham's 85 brother. 251
22:24 And his concubine, 6370 whose name 8034 [was] Reumah, 7208 she bare 3205-4 also Tebah, 2875 and Gaham, 1514 and Thahash, 8477 and Maachah. 4601
23:1 And Sarah 8283 was an hundred 3967 8141 and seven 7651 8141 and twenty 6242 years 8141 old: 2416 [these were] the years 8141 of the life 2416 of Sarah. 8283
23:2 And Sarah 8283 died 4191-4 in Kirjatharba; 7153 the same [is] Hebron 2275 in the land 776 of Canaan: 3667 and Abraham 85 came 935-4 to mourn 5594-2 for Sarah, 8283 and to weep 1058-2 for her.
23:3 And Abraham 85 stood up 6965-4 from before 6440 his dead, 4191-5 and spake 1696-17 unto the sons 1121 of Heth, 2845 saying, 559-2
23:4 I [am] a stranger 1616 and a sojourner 8453 with you: give 5414-3 me a possession 272 of a buryingplace 6913 with you, that I may bury 6912-4 my dead 4191-5 out of my sight. 6440
23:5 And the children 1121 of Heth 2845 answered 6030-4 Abraham, 85 saying 559-2 unto him,
23:6 Hear 8085-3 us, my lord: 113 thou [art] a mighty 430 prince 5387 among 8432 us: in the choice 4005 of our sepulchres 6913 bury 6912-3 thy dead; 4191-5 none 3808 of us 376 shall withhold 3607-4 from thee his sepulchre, 6913 but that thou mayest bury 6912-2 thy dead. 4191-5
23:7 And Abraham 85 stood up, 6965-4 and bowed 7812-101 himself to the people 5971 of the land, 776 [even] to the children 1121 of Heth. 2845
23:8 And he communed 1696-17 with them, saying, 559-2 If it be 3426 your mind 5315 that I should bury 6912-2 my dead 4191-5 out of my sight; 6440 hear 8085-3 me, and intreat 6293-3 for me to Ephron 6085 the son 1121 of Zohar, 6714
23:9 That he may give 5414-4 me the cave 4631 of Machpelah, 4375 which he hath, which [is] in the end 7097 of his field; 7704 for as much money 3701 as it is worth 4392 he shall give 5414-4 it me for a possession 272 of a buryingplace 6913 amongst 8432 you.
23:10 And Ephron 6085 dwelt 3427-6 among 8432 the children 1121 of Heth: 2845 and Ephron 6085 the Hittite 2850 answered 6030-4 Abraham 85 in the audience 241 of the children 1121 of Heth, 2845 [even] of all that went in 935-6 at the gate 8179 of his city, 5892 saying, 559-2
23:11 Nay, 3808 my lord, 113 hear 8085-3 me: the field 7704 give 5414-1 I thee, and the cave 4631 that [is] therein, I give 5414-1 it thee; in the presence 5869 of the sons 1121 of my people 5971 give 5414-1 I it thee: bury 6912-3 thy dead. 4191-5
23:12 And Abraham 85 bowed down 7812-101 himself before 6440 the people 5971 of the land. 776
23:13 And he spake 1696-17 unto Ephron 6085 in the audience 241 of the people 5971 of the land, 776 saying, 559-2 But if thou [wilt give it], I pray thee, 3863 hear 8085-3 me: I will give 5414-1 thee money 3701 for the field; 7704 take 3947-3 [it] of me, and I will bury 6912-4 my dead 4191-5 there.
23:14 And Ephron 6085 answered 6030-4 Abraham, 85 saying 559-2 unto him,
23:15 My lord, 113 hearken 8085-3 unto me: the land 776 [is worth] four 702 hundred 3967 shekels 8255 of silver; 3701 what [is] that betwixt 996 me and thee? bury 6912-3 therefore thy dead. 4191-5
23:16 And Abraham 85 hearkened 8085-4 unto Ephron; 6085 and Abraham 85 weighed 8254-4 to Ephron 6085 the silver, 3701 which he had named 1696-14 in the audience 241 of the sons 1121 of Heth, 2845 four 702 hundred 3967 shekels 8255 of silver, 3701 current 5674-6 [money] with the merchant. 5503-6
23:17 And the field 7704 of Ephron, 6085 which [was] in Machpelah, 4375 which [was] before 6440 Mamre, 4471 the field, 7704 and the cave 4631 which [was] therein, and all the trees 6086 that [were] in the field, 7704 that [were] in all the borders 1366 round about, 5439 were made sure 6965-4
23:18 Unto Abraham 85 for a possession 4736 in the presence 5869 of the children 1121 of Heth, 2845 before all that went in 935-6 at the gate 8179 of his city. 5892
23:19 And after 310 this, 3651 Abraham 85 buried 6912-1 Sarah 8283 his wife 802 in the cave 4631 of the field 7704 of Machpelah 4375 before 6440 Mamre: 4471 the same [is] Hebron 2275 in the land 776 of Canaan. 3667
23:20 And the field, 7704 and the cave 4631 that [is] therein, were made sure 6965-4 unto Abraham 85 for a possession 272 of a buryingplace 6913 by the sons 1121 of Heth. 2845
24:1 And Abraham 85 was old, 2204-1 [and] well stricken 935-1 in age: 3117 and the LORD 3068 had blessed 1288-14 Abraham 85 in all things.
24:2 And Abraham 85 said 559-4 unto his eldest 2205 servant 5650 of his house, 1004 that ruled 4910-6 over all that he had, Put, 7760-3 I pray thee, thy hand 3027 under my thigh: 3409
24:3 And I will make thee swear 7650-55 by the LORD, 3068 the God 430 of heaven, 8064 and the God 430 of the earth, 776 that thou shalt not take 3947-4 a wife 802 unto my son 1121 of the daughters 1323 of the Canaanites, 3669 among 7130 whom I dwell: 3427-6
24:4 But thou shalt go 3212-4 unto my country, 776 and to my kindred, 4138 and take 3947-1 a wife 802 unto my son 1121 Isaac. 3327
24:5 And the servant 5650 said 559-4 unto him, Peradventure the woman 802 will not be willing 14-4 to follow 3212-2 310 me unto this land: 776 must I needs bring 7725-55 thy son 1121 again 7725-53 unto the land 776 from whence thou camest? 3318-1
24:6 And Abraham 85 said 559-4 unto him, Beware 8104-10 thou that thou bring not 6435 my son 1121 thither again. 7725-55
24:7 The LORD 3068 God 430 of heaven, 8064 which took me 3947-1 from my father's 1 house, 1004 and from the land 776 of my kindred, 4138 and which spake 1696-14 unto me, and that sware 7650-8 unto me, saying, 559-2 Unto thy seed 2233 will I give 5414-4 this land; 776 he shall send 7971-4 his angel 4397 before 6440 thee, and thou shalt take 3947-1 a wife 802 unto my son 1121 from thence.
24:8 And if the woman 802 will not be willing 14-4 to follow 3212-2 thee, 310 then thou shalt be clear 5352-8 from this my oath: 7621 only bring not my son 1121 thither again. 7725-55
24:9 And the servant 5650 put 7760-4 his hand 3027 under the thigh 3409 of Abraham 85 his master, 113 and sware 7650-11 to him concerning 5921 that 2088 matter. 1697
24:10 And the servant 5650 took 3947-4 ten 6235 camels 1581 of the camels 1581 of his master, 113 and departed; 3212-4 for all the goods 2898 of his master 113 [were] in his hand: 3027 and he arose, 6965-4 and went 3212-4 to Mesopotamia, 763 unto the city 5892 of Nahor. 5152
24:11 And he made his camels 1581 to kneel down 1288-55 without 2351 the city 5892 by 413 a well 875 of water 4325 at the time 6256 of the evening, 6153 [even] the time 6256 that women go out 3318-2 to draw 7579-6 [water].
24:12 And he said, 559-4 O LORD 3068 God 430 of my master 113 Abraham, 85 I pray thee, send me 6440 good speed 7136-54 this day, 3117 and shew 6213-3 kindness 2617 unto 5973 my master 113 Abraham. 85
24:13 Behold, I stand 5324-12 [here] by the well 5869 of water; 4325 and the daughters 1323 of the men 582 of the city 5892 come out 3318-6 to draw 7579-2 water: 4325
24:14 And let it come to pass, that the damsel 5291 to whom I shall say, 559-4 Let down 5186-54 thy pitcher, 3537 I pray thee, that I may drink; 8354-4 and she shall say, 559-1 Drink, 8354-3 and I will give thy camels 1581 drink 8248-55 also: [let the same be] she [that] thou hast appointed 3198-52 for thy servant 5650 Isaac; 3327 and thereby shall I know 3045-4 that thou hast shewed 6213-1 kindness 2617 unto my master. 113
24:15 And it came to pass, before he had done 3615-14 speaking, 1696-15 that, behold, Rebekah 7259 came out, 3318-6 who 834 was born 3205-27 to Bethuel, 1328 son 1121 of Milcah, 4435 the wife 802 of Nahor, 5152 Abraham's 85 brother, 251 with her pitcher 3537 upon her shoulder. 7926
24:16 And the damsel 5291 [was] very 3966 fair 2896 to look upon, 4758 a virgin, 1330 neither had any man 376 known 3045-1 her: and she went down 3381-4 to the well, 5869 and filled 4390-17 her pitcher, 3537 and came up. 5927-4
24:17 And the servant 5650 ran 7323-4 to meet 7125-2 her, and said, 559-4 Let me, I pray thee, drink 1572-54 a little 4592 water 4325 of thy pitcher. 3537
24:18 And she said, 559-4 Drink, 8354-3 my lord: 113 and she hasted, 4116-17 and let down 3381-55 her pitcher 3537 upon her hand, 3027 and gave him drink. 8248-55
24:19 And when she had done 3615-17 giving him drink, 8248-53 she said, 559-4 I will draw 7579-4 [water] for thy camels 1581 also, until they have done 3615-14 drinking. 8354-2
24:20 And she hasted, 4116-17 and emptied 6168-17 her pitcher 3537 into the trough, 8268 and ran 7323-4 again unto the well 875 to draw 7579-2 [water], and drew 7579-4 for all his camels. 1581
24:21 And the man 376 wondering 7583-102 at her held his peace, 2790-56 to wit 3045-2 whether the LORD 3068 had made his journey 1870 prosperous 6743-52 or 518 not.
24:22 And it came to pass, as the camels 1581 had done 3615-14 drinking, 8354-2 that the man 376 took 3947-4 a golden 2091 earring 5141 of half a shekel 1235 weight, 4948 and two 8147 bracelets 6781 for her hands 3027 of ten 6235 [shekels] weight 4948 of gold; 2091
24:23 And said, 559-4 Whose 4310 daughter 1323 [art] thou? 859 tell 5046-54 me, I pray thee: is there 3426 room 4725 [in] thy father's 1 house 1004 for us to lodge in? 3885-2
24:24 And she said 559-4 unto him, I [am] the daughter 1323 of Bethuel 1328 the son 1121 of Milcah, 4435 which she bare 3205-1 unto Nahor. 5152
24:25 She said 559-4 moreover unto him, We have both 1571 straw 8401 and 1571 provender 4554 enough, 7227 and 1571 room 4725 to lodge in. 3885-2
24:26 And the man 376 bowed down his head, 6915-4 and worshipped 7812-101 the LORD. 3068
24:27 And he said, 559-4 Blessed 1288-7 [be] the LORD 3068 God 430 of my master 113 Abraham, 85 who hath not left destitute 5800-1 5973 my master 113 of his mercy 2617 and his truth: 571 I [being] in the way, 1870 the LORD 3068 led 5148-1 me to the house 1004 of my master's 113 brethren. 251
24:28 And the damsel 5291 ran, 7323-4 and told 5046-55 [them of] her mother's 517 house 1004 these things. 1697
24:29 And Rebekah 7259 had a brother, 251 and his name 8034 [was] Laban: 3837 and Laban 3837 ran 7323-4 out 2351 unto the man, 376 unto the well. 5869
24:30 And it came to pass, when he saw 7200-2 the earring 5141 and bracelets 6781 upon his sister's 269 hands, 3027 and when he heard 8085-2 the words 1697 of Rebekah 7259 his sister, 269 saying, 559-2 Thus 3541 spake 1696-14 the man 376 unto me; that he came 935-4 unto the man; 376 and, behold, he stood 5975-6 by 5921 the camels 1581 at the well. 5869
24:31 And he said, 559-4 Come in, 935-3 thou blessed 1288-7 of the LORD; 3068 wherefore standest 5975-4 thou without? 2351 for I have prepared 6437-14 the house, 1004 and room 4725 for the camels. 1581
24:32 And the man 376 came 935-4 into the house: 1004 and he ungirded 6605-17 his camels, 1581 and gave 5414-4 straw 8401 and provender 4554 for the camels, 1581 and water 4325 to wash 7364-2 his feet, 7272 and the men's 582 feet 7272 that [were] with him.
24:33 And there was set 7760-93|3455-4-k [meat] before 6440 him to eat: 398-2 but he said, 559-4 I will not eat, 398-4 until I have told 1696-14 mine errand. 1697 And he said, 559-4 Speak on. 1696-16
24:34 And he said, 559-4 I [am] Abraham's 85 servant. 5650
24:35 And the LORD 3068 hath blessed 1288-14 my master 113 greatly; 3966 and he is become great: 1431-4 and he hath given 5414-4 him flocks, 6629 and herds, 1241 and silver, 3701 and gold, 2091 and menservants, 5650 and maidservants, 8198 and camels, 1581 and asses. 2543
24:36 And Sarah 8283 my master's 113 wife 802 bare 3205-4 a son 1121 to my master 113 when 310 she was old: 2209 and unto him hath he given 5414-4 all that he hath.
24:37 And my master 113 made me swear, 7650-55 saying, 559-2 Thou shalt not take 3947-4 a wife 802 to my son 1121 of the daughters 1323 of the Canaanites, 3669 in whose land 776 I dwell: 3427-6
24:38 But 518 thou shalt go 3212-4 unto my father's 1 house, 1004 and to my kindred, 4940 and take 3947-1 a wife 802 unto my son. 1121
24:39 And I said 559-4 unto my master, 113 Peradventure the woman 802 will not follow 3212-4 310 me.
24:40 And he said 559-4 unto me, The LORD, 3068 before 6440 whom I walk, 1980-98 will send 7971-4 his angel 4397 with thee, and prosper 6743-52 thy way; 1870 and thou shalt take 3947-1 a wife 802 for my son 1121 of my kindred, 4940 and of my father's 1 house: 1004
24:41 Then shalt thou be clear 5352-11 from [this] my oath, 423 when thou comest 935-4 to my kindred; 4940 and if they give 5414-4 not thee [one], thou shalt be clear 5355 from my oath. 423
24:42 And I came 935-4 this day 3117 unto the well, 5869 and said, 559-4 O LORD 3068 God 430 of my master 113 Abraham, 85 if now thou do 3426 prosper 6743-56 my way 1870 which I go: 1980-6
24:43 Behold, I stand 5324-12 by the well 5869 of water; 4325 and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin 5959 cometh forth 3318-6 to draw 7579-2 [water], and I say 559-1 to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little 4592 water 4325 of thy pitcher 3537 to drink; 8248-54
24:44 And she say 559-1 to me, Both drink 8354-3 thou, and I will also draw 7579-4 for thy camels: 1581 [let] the same [be] the woman 802 whom the LORD 3068 hath appointed 3198-52 out for my master's 113 son. 1121
24:45 And before I had done 3615-17 speaking 1696-15 in mine heart, 3820 behold, Rebekah 7259 came forth 3318-6 with her pitcher 3537 on her shoulder; 7926 and she went down 3381-4 unto the well, 5869 and drew 7579-4 [water]: and I said 559-4 unto her, Let me drink, 8248-54 I pray thee.
24:46 And she made haste, 4116-17 and let down 3381-55 her pitcher 3537 from her [shoulder], and said, 559-4 Drink, 8354-3 and I will give thy camels 1581 drink 8248-55 also: so I drank, 8354-4 and she made the camels 1581 drink 8248-52 also.
24:47 And I asked 7592-4 her, and said, 559-4 Whose daughter 1323 [art] thou? And she said, 559-4 The daughter 1323 of Bethuel, 1328 Nahor's 5152 son, 1121 whom Milcah 4435 bare 3205-1 unto him: and I put 7760-4 the earring 5141 upon her face, 639 and the bracelets 6781 upon her hands. 3027
24:48 And I bowed down my head, 6915-4 and worshipped 7812-101 the LORD, 3068 and blessed 1288-17 the LORD 3068 God 430 of my master 113 Abraham, 85 which had led 5148-52 me in the right 571 way 1870 to take 3947-2 my master's 113 brother's 251 daughter 1323 unto his son. 1121
24:49 And now if ye will 3426 deal 6213-6 kindly 2617 and truly 571 with my master, 113 tell 5046-54 me: and if not, tell 5046-54 me; that I may turn 6437-4 to the right hand, 3225 or 176 to the left. 8040
24:50 Then Laban 3837 and Bethuel 1328 answered 6030-4 and said, 559-4 The thing 1697 proceedeth 3318-1 from the LORD: 3068 we cannot 3808 3201-4 speak 1696-15 unto thee bad 7451 or 176 good. 2896
24:51 Behold, Rebekah 7259 [is] before 6440 thee, take 3947-3 [her], and go, 3212-3 and let her be thy master's 113 son's 1121 wife, 802 as the LORD 3068 hath spoken. 1696-14
24:52 And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's 85 servant 5650 heard 8085-1 their words, 1697 he worshipped 7812-101 the LORD, 3068 [bowing himself] to the earth. 776
24:53 And the servant 5650 brought forth 3318-55 jewels 3627 of silver, 3701 and jewels 3627 of gold, 2091 and raiment, 899 and gave 5414-4 [them] to Rebekah: 7259 he gave 5414-1 also to her brother 251 and to her mother 517 precious things. 4030
24:54 And they did eat 398-4 and drink, 8354-4 he and the men 582 that [were] with him, and tarried all night; 3885-4 and they rose up 6965-4 in the morning, 1242 and he said, 559-4 Send me away 7971-16 unto my master. 113
24:55 And her brother 251 and her mother 517 said, 559-4 Let the damsel 5291 abide 3427-4 with us [a few] days, 3117 at the least 176 ten; 6218 after 310 that she shall go. 3212-4
24:56 And he said 559-4 unto them, Hinder 309-17 me not, seeing the LORD 3068 hath prospered 6743-52 my way; 1870 send me away 7971-16 that I may go 3212-4 to my master. 113
24:57 And they said, 559-4 We will call 7121-4 the damsel, 5291 and enquire 7592-4 at her mouth. 6310
24:58 And they called 7121-4 Rebekah, 7259 and said 559-4 unto her, Wilt thou go 3212-4 with this man? 376 And she said, 559-4 I will go. 3212-4
24:59 And they sent away 7971-17 Rebekah 7259 their sister, 269 and her nurse, 3243-56 and Abraham's 85 servant, 5650 and his men. 582
24:60 And they blessed 1288-17 Rebekah, 7259 and said 559-4 unto her, Thou 859 [art] our sister, 269 be thou 1961-3 [the mother] of thousands 505 of millions, 7233 and let thy seed 2233 possess 3423-4 the gate 8179 of those which hate 8130-6 them.
24:61 And Rebekah 7259 arose, 6965-4 and her damsels, 5291 and they rode 7392-4 upon the camels, 1581 and followed 3212-4 310 the man: 376 and the servant 5650 took 3947-4 Rebekah, 7259 and went his way. 3212-4
24:62 And Isaac 3327 came 935-1 from the way 935-2 of the well Lahairoi; 883 for he dwelt 3427-6 in the south 5045 country. 776
24:63 And Isaac 3327 went out 3318-4 to meditate 7742-2 in the field 7704 at the eventide: 6437-2 6153 and he lifted up 5375-4 his eyes, 5869 and saw, 7200-4 and, behold, the camels 1581 [were] coming. 935-6
24:64 And Rebekah 7259 lifted up 5375-4 her eyes, 5869 and when she saw 7200-4 Isaac, 3327 she lighted 5307-4 off 5921 the camel. 1581
24:65 For she [had] said 559-4 unto the servant, 5650 What 4310 man 376 [is] this 1976 that walketh 1980-6 in the field 7704 to meet 7125-2 us? And the servant 5650 [had] said, 559-4 It [is] my master: 113 therefore she took 3947-4 a vail, 6809 and covered 3680-101 herself.
24:66 And the servant 5650 told 5608-17 Isaac 3327 all things 1697 that he had done. 6213-1
24:67 And Isaac 3327 brought her 935-55 into his mother 517 Sarah's 8283 tent, 168 and took 3947-4 Rebekah, 7259 and she became his wife; 802 and he loved 157-4 her: and Isaac 3327 was comforted 5162-11 after 310 his mother's 517 [death].
25:1 Then again 3254-55 Abraham 85 took 3947-4 a wife, 802 and her name 8034 [was] Keturah. 6989
25:2 And she bare 3205-4 him Zimran, 2175 and Jokshan, 3370 and Medan, 4091 and Midian, 4080 and Ishbak, 3435 and Shuah. 7744
25:3 And Jokshan 3370 begat 3205-1 Sheba, 7614 and Dedan. 1719 And the sons 1121 of Dedan 1719 were Asshurim, 805 and Letushim, 3912 and Leummim. 3817
25:4 And the sons 1121 of Midian; 4080 Ephah, 5891 and Epher, 6081 and Hanoch, 2585 and Abida, 28 and Eldaah. 420 All these [were] the children 1121 of Keturah. 6989
25:5 And Abraham 85 gave 5414-4 all that he had unto Isaac. 3327
25:6 But unto the sons 1121 of the concubines, 6370 which Abraham 85 had, Abraham 85 gave 5414-1 gifts, 4979 and sent them away 7971-17 from Isaac 3327 his son, 1121 while he yet lived, 2416 eastward, 6924 unto the east 6924 country. 776
25:7 And these [are] the days 3117 of the years 8141 of Abraham's 85 life 2416 which he lived, 2425-1 an hundred 3967 8141 threescore 8141 and fifteen 7657 2568 years. 8141
25:8 Then Abraham 85 gave up the ghost, 1478-4 and died 4191-4 in a good 2896 old age, 7872 an old man, 2205 and full 7649 [of years]; and was gathered 622-11 to his people. 5971
25:9 And his sons 1121 Isaac 3327 and Ishmael 3458 buried 6912-4 him in the cave 4631 of Machpelah, 4375 in the field 7704 of Ephron 6085 the son 1121 of Zohar 6714 the Hittite, 2850 which [is] before 6440 Mamre; 4471
25:10 The field 7704 which Abraham 85 purchased 7069-1 of the sons 1121 of Heth: 2845 there was Abraham 85 buried, 6912-27 and Sarah 8283 his wife. 802
25:11 And it came to pass after 310 the death 4194 of Abraham, 85 that God 430 blessed 1288-17 his son 1121 Isaac; 3327 and Isaac 3327 dwelt 3427-4 by 5973 the well Lahairoi. 883
25:12 Now these [are] the generations 8435 of Ishmael, 3458 Abraham's 85 son, 1121 whom Hagar 1904 the Egyptian, 4713 Sarah's 8283 handmaid, 8198 bare 3205-1 unto Abraham: 85
25:13 And these [are] the names 8034 of the sons 1121 of Ishmael, 3458 by their names, 8034 according to their generations: 8435 the firstborn 1060 of Ishmael, 3458 Nebajoth; 5032 and Kedar, 6938 and Adbeel, 110 and Mibsam, 4017
25:14 And Mishma, 4927 and Dumah, 1746 and Massa, 4854
25:15 Hadar, 2316 and Tema, 8485 Jetur, 3195 Naphish, 5305 and Kedemah: 6929
25:16 These [are] the sons 1121 of Ishmael, 3458 and these [are] their names, 8034 by their towns, 2691 and by their castles; 2918 twelve 8147 6240 princes 5387 according to their nations. 523
25:17 And these [are] the years 8141 of the life 2416 of Ishmael, 3458 an hundred 3967 8141 and thirty 7970 8141 and seven 7651 years: 8141 and he gave up the ghost 1478-4 and died; 4191-4 and was gathered 622-11 unto his people. 5971
25:18 And they dwelt 7931-4 from Havilah 2341 unto Shur, 7793 that [is] before 6440 Egypt, 4714 as thou goest 935-2 toward Assyria: 804 [and] he died 5307-1 in the presence 6440 of all his brethren. 251
25:19 And these [are] the generations 8435 of Isaac, 3327 Abraham's 85 son: 1121 Abraham 85 begat 3205-52 Isaac: 3327
25:20 And Isaac 3327 was forty 705 years 8141 old 1121 when he took 3947-2 Rebekah 7259 to wife, 802 the daughter 1323 of Bethuel 1328 the Syrian 761 of Padanaram, 6307 the sister 269 to Laban 3837 the Syrian. 761
25:21 And Isaac 3327 intreated 6279-4 the LORD 3068 for 5227 his wife, 802 because she [was] barren: 6135 and the LORD 3068 was intreated 6279-11 of him, and Rebekah 7259 his wife 802 conceived. 2029-4
25:22 And the children 1121 struggled together 7533-108 within 7130 her; and she said, 559-4 If [it be] so, why [am] I thus? 2088 And she went 3212-4 to enquire 1875-2 of the LORD. 3068
25:23 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto her, Two 8147 nations 1471 [are] in thy womb, 990 and two 8147 manner of people 3816 shall be separated 6504-11 from thy bowels; 4578 and [the one] people 3816 shall be stronger 553-4 than [the other] people; 3816 and the elder 7227 shall serve 5647-4 the younger. 6810
25:24 And when her days 3117 to be delivered 3205-2 were fulfilled, 4390-4 behold, [there were] twins 8380 in her womb. 990
25:25 And the first 7223 came out 3318-4 red, 132 all over like an hairy 8181 garment; 155 and they called 7121-4 his name 8034 Esau. 6215
25:26 And after 310 that came his brother 251 out, 3318-1 and his hand 3027 took hold 270-6 on Esau's 6215 heel; 6119 and his name 8034 was called 7121-4 Jacob: 3290 and Isaac 3327 [was] threescore 8346 years 8141 old 1121 when she bare 3205-2 them.
25:27 And the boys 5288 grew: 1431-4 and Esau 6215 was a cunning 3045-6 hunter, 6718 a man 376 of the field; 7704 and Jacob 3290 [was] a plain 8535 man, 376 dwelling 3427-6 in tents. 168
25:28 And Isaac 3327 loved 157-4 Esau, 6215 because he did eat 6310 of [his] venison: 6718 but Rebekah 7259 loved 157-6 Jacob. 3290
25:29 And Jacob 3290 sod 2102-55 pottage: 5138 and Esau 6215 came 935-4 from the field, 7704 and he [was] faint: 5889
25:30 And Esau 6215 said 559-4 to Jacob, 3290 Feed 3938-54 me, I pray thee, with 4480 that same 122 red 122 [pottage]; for I [am] faint: 5889 therefore was his name 8034 called 7121-1 Edom. 123
25:31 And Jacob 3290 said, 559-4 Sell 4376-3 me this day 3117 thy birthright. 1062
25:32 And Esau 6215 said, 559-4 Behold, I [am] at the point 1980-6 to die: 4191-2 and what profit shall this birthright 1062 do to me?
25:33 And Jacob 3290 said, 559-4 Swear 7650-10 to me this day; 3117 and he sware 7650-11 unto him: and he sold 4376-4 his birthright 1062 unto Jacob. 3290
25:34 Then Jacob 3290 gave 5414-1 Esau 6215 bread 3899 and pottage 5138 of lentiles; 5742 and he did eat 398-4 and drink, 8354-4 and rose up, 6965-4 and went his way: 3212-4 thus Esau 6215 despised 959-4 [his] birthright. 1062
26:1 And there was a famine 7458 in the land, 776 beside 905 the first 7223 famine 7458 that was in the days 3117 of Abraham. 85 And Isaac 3327 went 3212-4 unto Abimelech 40 king 4428 of the Philistines 6430 unto Gerar. 1642
26:2 And the LORD 3068 appeared 7200-11 unto him, and said, 559-4 Go not down 3381-4 into Egypt; 4714 dwell 7931-3 in the land 776 which I shall tell 559-4 thee of:
26:3 Sojourn 1481-3 in this land, 776 and I will be with thee, and will bless 1288-17 thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, 2233 I will give 5414-4 all these 411 countries, 776 and I will perform 6965-52 the oath 7621 which I sware 7650-8 unto Abraham 85 thy father; 1
26:4 And I will make thy seed 2233 to multiply 7235-52 as the stars 3556 of heaven, 8064 and will give 5414-1 unto thy seed 2233 all these 411 countries; 776 and in thy seed 2233 shall all the nations 1471 of the earth 776 be blessed; 1288-98
26:5 Because 6118 that Abraham 85 obeyed 8085-1 my voice, 6963 and kept 8104-4 my charge, 4931 my commandments, 4687 my statutes, 2708 and my laws. 8451
26:6 And Isaac 3327 dwelt 3427-4 in Gerar: 1642
26:7 And the men 582 of the place 4725 asked 7592-4 [him] of his wife; 802 and he said, 559-4 She [is] my sister: 269 for he feared 3372-1 to say, 559-2 [She is] my wife; 802 lest, [said he], the men 582 of the place 4725 should kill 2026-4 me for Rebekah; 7259 because she [was] fair 2896 to look upon. 4758
26:8 And it came to pass, when he had been there a long 748-1 time, 3117 that Abimelech 40 king 4428 of the Philistines 6430 looked out 8259-55 at 1157 a window, 2474 and saw, 7200-4 and, behold, Isaac 3327 [was] sporting 6711-18 with Rebekah 7259 his wife. 802
26:9 And Abimelech 40 called 7121-4 Isaac, 3327 and said, 559-4 Behold, of a surety 389 she [is] thy wife: 802 and how saidst 559-1 thou, She [is] my sister? 269 And Isaac 3327 said 559-4 unto him, Because I said, 559-1 Lest I die 4191-4 for her.
26:10 And Abimelech 40 said, 559-4 What [is] this thou hast done 6213-1 unto us? one 259 of the people 5971 might lightly 4592 have lien 7901-1 with thy wife, 802 and thou shouldest have brought 935-52 guiltiness 817 upon us.
26:11 And Abimelech 40 charged 6680-17 all [his] people, 5971 saying, 559-2 He that toucheth 5060-6 this man 376 or his wife 802 shall surely 4191-2 be put to death. 4191-93
26:12 Then Isaac 3327 sowed 2232-4 in that land, 776 and received 4672-4 in the same year 8141 an hundredfold: 3967 8180 and the LORD 3068 blessed 1288-17 him.
26:13 And the man 376 waxed great, 1431-4 and went 3212-4 forward, 1980-2 and grew 1432 until he became very 3966 great: 1431-1
26:14 For he had possession 4735 of flocks, 6629 and possession 4735 of herds, 1241 and great 7227 store of servants: 5657 and the Philistines 6430 envied 7065-17 him.
26:15 For all the wells 875 which his father's 1 servants 5650 had digged 2658-1 in the days 3117 of Abraham 85 his father, 1 the Philistines 6430 had stopped 5640-14 them, and filled 4390-17 them with earth. 6083
26:16 And Abimelech 40 said 559-4 unto Isaac, 3327 Go 3212-3 from us; for thou art much 3966 mightier 6105-1 than we.
26:17 And Isaac 3327 departed 3212-4 thence, 8033 and pitched his tent 2583-4 in the valley 5158 of Gerar, 1642 and dwelt 3427-4 there.
26:18 And Isaac 3327 digged 2658-4 again 7725-4 the wells 875 of water, 4325 which they had digged 2658-1 in the days 3117 of Abraham 85 his father; 1 for the Philistines 6430 had stopped 5640-17 them after 310 the death 4194 of Abraham: 85 and he called 7121-4 their names 8034 after the names 8034 by which 834 his father 1 had called 7121-1 them.
26:19 And Isaac's 3327 servants 5650 digged 2658-4 in the valley, 5158 and found 4672-4 there a well 875 of springing 2416 water. 4325
26:20 And the herdmen 7462-6 of Gerar 1642 did strive 7378-4 with Isaac's 3327 herdmen, 7462-6 saying, 559-2 The water 4325 [is] ours: and he called 7121-4 the name 8034 of the well 875 Esek; 6230 because they strove 6229-98 with him.
26:21 And they digged 2658-4 another 312 well, 875 and strove 7378-4 for that also: and he called 7121-4 the name 8034 of it Sitnah. 7856
26:22 And he removed 6275-55 from thence, and digged 2658-4 another 312 well; 875 and for that they strove 7378-1 not: and he called 7121-4 the name 8034 of it Rehoboth; 7344 and he said, 559-4 For now 6258 the LORD 3068 hath made room 7337-52 for us, and we shall be fruitful 6509-1 in the land. 776
26:23 And he went up 5927-4 from thence to Beersheba. 884
26:24 And the LORD 3068 appeared 7200-11 unto him the same night, 3915 and said, 559-4 I [am] the God 430 of Abraham 85 thy father: 1 fear 3372-4 not, for I [am] with thee, 854 and will bless 1288-14 thee, and multiply 7235-52 thy seed 2233 for my servant 5650 Abraham's 85 sake.
26:25 And he builded 1129-4 an altar 4196 there, and called 7121-4 upon the name 8034 of the LORD, 3068 and pitched 5186-4 his tent 168 there: and there Isaac's 3327 servants 5650 digged 3738-4 a well. 875
26:26 Then Abimelech 40 went 1980-1 to him from Gerar, 1642 and Ahuzzath 276 one of his friends, 4828 and Phichol 6369 the chief captain 8269 of his army. 6635
26:27 And Isaac 3327 said 559-4 unto them, Wherefore 4069 come 935-1 ye to me, seeing ye hate 8130-1 me, and have sent me away 7971-17 from you?
26:28 And they said, 559-4 We saw 7200-1 certainly 7200-2 that the LORD 3068 was with thee: and we said, 559-4 Let there be now an oath 423 betwixt us, 996 [even] betwixt us 996 and thee, and let us make 3772-4 a covenant 1285 with thee;
26:29 That thou wilt do 6213-4 us no hurt, 7451 as we have not touched 5060-1 thee, and as we have done 6213-1 unto thee nothing but 7535 good, 2896 and have sent thee away 7971-17 in peace: 7965 thou [art] now 6258 the blessed 1288-7 of the LORD. 3068
26:30 And he made 6213-4 them a feast, 4960 and they did eat 398-4 and drink. 8354-4
26:31 And they rose up betimes 7925-55 in the morning, 1242 and sware 7650-11 one 376 to another: 251 and Isaac 3327 sent them away, 7971-17 and they departed 3212-4 from him in peace. 7965
26:32 And it came to pass the same day, 3117 that Isaac's 3327 servants 5650 came, 935-4 and told 5046-55 him concerning 182 the well 875 which they had digged, 2658-1 and said 559-4 unto him, We have found 4672-1 water. 4325
26:33 And he called 7121-4 it Shebah: 7656 therefore the name 8034 of the city 5892 [is] Beersheba 884 unto this day. 3117
26:34 And Esau 6215 was forty 705 years 8141 old 1121 when he took 3947-4 to wife 802 Judith 3067 the daughter 1323 of Beeri 882 the Hittite, 2850 and Bashemath 1315 the daughter 1323 of Elon 356 the Hittite: 2850
26:35 Which were a grief 4786 of mind 7307 unto Isaac 3327 and to Rebekah. 7259
27:1 And it came to pass, 1961-4 that when Isaac 3327 was old, 2204-1 and his eyes 5869 were dim, 3543-4 so that he could not see, 7200-2 he called 7121-4 Esau 6215 his eldest 1419 son, 1121 and said 559-4 unto him, My son: 1121 and he said 559-4 unto him, Behold, [here am] I.
27:2 And he said, 559-4 Behold now, I am old, 2204-1 I know 3045-1 not the day 3117 of my death: 4194
27:3 Now therefore take, 5375-3 I pray thee, thy weapons, 3627 thy quiver 8522 and thy bow, 7198 and go out 3318-3 to the field, 7704 and take 6679-3 me [some] venison; 6718|6720-k
27:4 And make 6213-3 me savoury meat, 4303 such as 834 I love, 157-1 and bring 935-54 [it] to me, that I may eat; 398-4 that my soul 5315 may bless 1288-17 thee before 2962 I die. 4191-4
27:5 And Rebekah 7259 heard 8085-6 when Isaac 3327 spake 1696-15 to Esau 6215 his son. 1121 And Esau 6215 went 3212-4 to the field 7704 to hunt 6679-2 [for] venison, 6718 [and] to bring 935-53 [it].
27:6 And Rebekah 7259 spake 559-1 unto Jacob 3290 her son, 1121 saying, 559-2 Behold, I heard 8085-1 thy father 1 speak 1696-18 unto Esau 6215 thy brother, 251 saying, 559-2
27:7 Bring 935-54 me venison, 6718 and make 6213-3 me savoury meat, 4303 that I may eat, 398-4 and bless 1288-17 thee before 6440 the LORD 3068 before 6440 my death. 4194
27:8 Now therefore, my son, 1121 obey 8085-3 my voice 6963 according to that which 834 I command 6680-18 thee.
27:9 Go 3212-3 now to the flock, 6629 and fetch 3947-3 me from thence two 8147 good 2896 kids 1423 of the goats; 5795 and I will make 6213-4 them savoury meat 4303 for thy father, 1 such as he loveth: 157-1
27:10 And thou shalt bring 935-52 [it] to thy father, 1 that he may eat, 398-1 and that 834 he may bless 1288-17 thee before 6440 his death. 4194
27:11 And Jacob 3290 said 559-4 to Rebekah 7259 his mother, 517 Behold, Esau 6215 my brother 251 [is] a hairy 8163 man, 376 and I [am] a smooth 2509 man: 376
27:12 My father 1 peradventure will feel 4959-4 me, and I shall seem 5869 to him as a deceiver; 8591-47 and I shall bring 935-52 a curse 7045 upon me, and not a blessing. 1293
27:13 And his mother 517 said 559-4 unto him, Upon me [be] thy curse, 7045 my son: 1121 only obey 8085-3 my voice, 6963 and go 3212-3 fetch 3947-3 me [them].
27:14 And he went, 3212-4 and fetched, 3947-4 and brought 935-55 [them] to his mother: 517 and his mother 517 made 6213-4 savoury meat, 4303 such as his father 1 loved. 157-1
27:15 And Rebekah 7259 took 3947-4 goodly 2532 raiment 899 of her eldest 1419 son 1121 Esau, 6215 which [were] with her in the house, 1004 and put 3847-55 them upon Jacob 3290 her younger 6996 son: 1121
27:16 And she put 3847-52 the skins 5785 of the kids 1423 of the goats 5795 upon his hands, 3027 and upon the smooth 2513 of his neck: 6677
27:17 And she gave 5414-4 the savoury meat 4303 and the bread, 3899 which she had prepared, 6213-1 into the hand 3027 of her son 1121 Jacob. 3290
27:18 And he came 935-4 unto his father, 1 and said, 559-4 My father: 1 and he said, 559-4 Here [am] I; who [art] thou, my son? 1121
27:19 And Jacob 3290 said 559-4 unto his father, 1 I [am] Esau 6215 thy firstborn; 1060 I have done 6213-1 according as thou badest 1696-14 me: arise, 6965-3 I pray thee, sit 3427-3 and eat 398-3 of my venison, 6718 that thy soul 5315 may bless 1288-17 me.
27:20 And Isaac 3327 said 559-4 unto his son, 1121 How [is it] that thou hast found 4672-2 [it] so quickly, 4116-14 my son? 1121 And he said, 559-4 Because the LORD 3068 thy God 430 brought 7136-52 [it] to me. 6440
27:21 And Isaac 3327 said 559-4 unto Jacob, 3290 Come near, 5066-3 I pray thee, that I may feel 4184-4 thee, my son, 1121 whether thou [be] my very 2088 son 1121 Esau 6215 or not.
27:22 And Jacob 3290 went near 5066-4 unto Isaac 3327 his father; 1 and he felt 4959-4 him, and said, 559-4 The voice 6963 [is] Jacob's 3290 voice, 6963 but the hands 3027 [are] the hands 3027 of Esau. 6215
27:23 And he discerned 5234-52 him not, because his hands 3027 were hairy, 8163 as his brother 251 Esau's 6215 hands: 3027 so he blessed 1288-17 him.
27:24 And he said, 559-4 [Art] thou my very son 1121 Esau? 6215 And he said, 559-4 I [am].
27:25 And he said, 559-4 Bring [it] near 5066-54 to me, and I will eat 398-4 of my son's 1121 venison, 6718 that my soul 5315 may bless 1288-17 thee. And he brought [it] near 5066-55 to him, and he did eat: 398-4 and he brought 935-55 him wine, 3196 and he drank. 8354-4
27:26 And his father 1 Isaac 3327 said 559-4 unto him, Come near 5066-3 now, and kiss 5401-3 me, my son. 1121
27:27 And he came near, 5066-4 and kissed 5401-4 him: and he smelled 7306-55 the smell 7381 of his raiment, 899 and blessed 1288-17 him, and said, 559-4 See, 7200-3 the smell 7381 of my son 1121 [is] as the smell 7381 of a field 7704 which the LORD 3068 hath blessed: 1288-14
27:28 Therefore God 430 give 5414-4 thee of the dew 2919 of heaven, 8064 and the fatness 4924 of the earth, 776 and plenty 7230 of corn 1715 and wine: 8492
27:29 Let people 5971 serve 5647-4 thee, and nations 3816 bow down 7812-101 to thee: be 1933-3 lord 1376 over thy brethren, 251 and let thy mother's 517 sons 1121 bow down 7812-101 to thee: cursed 779-7 [be] every one that curseth 779-6 thee, and blessed 1288-7 [be] he that blesseth 1288-18 thee.
27:30 And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac 3327 had made an end 3615-14 of blessing 1288-15 Jacob, 3290 and Jacob 3290 was yet 389 scarce 3318-2 gone out 3318-1 from the presence 6440 of Isaac 3327 his father, 1 that Esau 6215 his brother 251 came in 935-1 from his hunting. 6718
27:31 And he also had made 6213-4 savoury meat, 4303 and brought 935-55 it unto his father, 1 and said 559-4 unto his father, 1 Let my father 1 arise, 6965-4 and eat 398-4 of his son's 1121 venison, 6718 that thy soul 5315 may bless 1288-17 me.
27:32 And Isaac 3327 his father 1 said 559-4 unto him, Who [art] thou? And he said, 559-4 I [am] thy son, 1121 thy firstborn 1060 Esau. 6215
27:33 And Isaac 3327 trembled 2729-4 very 1419 exceedingly, 3966 2731 and said, 559-4 Who? where 645 [is] he that hath taken 6679-5 venison, 6718 and brought 935-55 [it] me, and I have eaten 398-4 of all before thou camest, 935-4 and have blessed 1288-17 him? yea, [and] he shall be blessed. 1288-7
27:34 And when Esau 6215 heard 8085-2 the words 1697 of his father, 1 he cried 6817-4 with a great 1419 and exceeding 3966 bitter 4751 cry, 6818 and said 559-4 unto his father, 1 Bless 1288-16 me, [even] me also, O my father. 1
27:35 And he said, 559-4 Thy brother 251 came 935-1 with subtilty, 4820 and hath taken away 3947-4 thy blessing. 1293
27:36 And he said, 559-4 Is not he rightly 3588 named 7121-1 8034 Jacob? 3290 for he hath supplanted me 6117-4 these 2088 two times: 6471 he took away 3947-1 my birthright; 1062 and, behold, now he hath taken away 3947-1 my blessing. 1293 And he said, 559-4 Hast thou not reserved 680-1 a blessing 1293 for me?
27:37 And Isaac 3327 answered 6030-4 and said 559-4 unto Esau, 6215 Behold, I have made 7760-1 him thy lord, 1376 and all his brethren 251 have I given 5414-1 to him for servants; 5650 and with corn 1715 and wine 8492 have I sustained 5564-1 him: and what shall I do 6213-4 now 645 unto thee, my son? 1121
27:38 And Esau 6215 said 559-4 unto his father, 1 Hast thou but one 259 blessing, 1293 my father? 1 bless 1288-16 me, [even] me also, O my father. 1 And Esau 6215 lifted up 5375-4 his voice, 6963 and wept. 1058-4
27:39 And Isaac 3327 his father 1 answered 6030-4 and said 559-4 unto him, Behold, thy dwelling 4186 shall be the fatness 4924 of the earth, 776 and of the dew 2919 of heaven 8064 from above; 5920
27:40 And by thy sword 2719 shalt thou live, 2421-4 and shalt serve 5647-4 thy brother; 251 and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, 7300-55 that thou shalt break 6561-1 his yoke 5923 from off thy neck. 6677
27:41 And Esau 6215 hated 7852-4 Jacob 3290 because 5921 of the blessing 1293 wherewith 834 his father 1 blessed 1288-14 him: and Esau 6215 said 559-4 in his heart, 3820 The days 3117 of mourning 60 for my father 1 are at hand; 7126-4 then will I slay 2026-4 my brother 251 Jacob. 3290
27:42 And these words 1697 of Esau 6215 her elder 1419 son 1121 were told 5046-93 to Rebekah: 7259 and she sent 7971-4 and called 7121-4 Jacob 3290 her younger 6996 son, 1121 and said 559-4 unto him, Behold, thy brother 251 Esau, 6215 as touching thee, doth comfort 5162-102 himself, [purposing] to kill 2026-2 thee.
27:43 Now therefore, my son, 1121 obey 8085-3 my voice; 6963 and arise, 6965-3 flee 1272-3 thou to Laban 3837 my brother 251 to Haran; 2771
27:44 And tarry 3427-1 with him a few 259 days, 3117 until 834 thy brother's 251 fury 2534 turn away; 7725-4
27:45 Until thy brother's 251 anger 639 turn away 7725-2 from thee, and he forget 7911-1 [that] which thou hast done 6213-1 to him: then I will send, 7971-1 and fetch 3947-1 thee from thence: why 4100 should I be deprived 7921-4 also of you both 8147 in one 259 day? 3117
27:46 And Rebekah 7259 said 559-4 to Isaac, 3327 I am weary 6973-1 of my life 2416 because 6440 of the daughters 1323 of Heth: 2845 if Jacob 3290 take 3947-6 a wife 802 of the daughters 1323 of Heth, 2845 such as these [which are] of the daughters 1323 of the land, 776 what good 4100 shall my life 2416 do me?
28:1 And Isaac 3327 called 7121-4 Jacob, 3290 and blessed 1288-17 him, and charged 6680-17 him, and said 559-4 unto him, Thou shalt not take 3947-4 a wife 802 of the daughters 1323 of Canaan. 3667
28:2 Arise, 6965-3 go 3212-3 to Padanaram, 6307 to the house 1004 of Bethuel 1328 thy mother's 517 father; 1 and take 3947-3 thee a wife 802 from thence of the daughters 1323 of Laban 3837 thy mother's 517 brother. 251
28:3 And God 410 Almighty 7706 bless 1288-17 thee, and make thee fruitful, 6509-55 and multiply 7235-55 thee, that thou mayest be a multitude 6951 of people; 5971
28:4 And give 5414-4 thee the blessing 1293 of Abraham, 85 to thee, and to thy seed 2233 with thee; that thou mayest inherit 3423-2 the land 776 wherein thou art a stranger, 4033 which God 430 gave 5414-1 unto Abraham. 85
28:5 And Isaac 3327 sent away 7971-4 Jacob: 3290 and he went 3212-4 to Padanaram 6307 unto Laban, 3837 son 1121 of Bethuel 1328 the Syrian, 761 the brother 251 of Rebekah, 7259 Jacob's 3290 and Esau's 6215 mother. 517
28:6 When Esau 6215 saw 7200-4 that Isaac 3327 had blessed 1288-14 Jacob, 3290 and sent him away 7971-14 to Padanaram, 6307 to take 3947-2 him a wife 802 from thence; and that as he blessed 1288-15 him he gave him a charge, 6680-17 saying, 559-2 Thou shalt not take 3947-4 a wife 802 of the daughters 1323 of Canaan; 3667
28:7 And that Jacob 3290 obeyed 8085-4 his father 1 and his mother, 517 and was gone 3212-4 to Padanaram; 6307
28:8 And Esau 6215 seeing 7200-4 that the daughters 1323 of Canaan 3667 pleased 5869 not 7451 Isaac 3327 his father; 1
28:9 Then went 3212-4 Esau 6215 unto Ishmael, 3458 and took 3947-4 unto the wives 802 which he had Mahalath 4258 the daughter 1323 of Ishmael 3458 Abraham's 85 son, 1121 the sister 269 of Nebajoth, 5032 to be his wife. 802
28:10 And Jacob 3290 went out 3318-4 from Beersheba, 884 and went 3212-4 toward Haran. 2771
28:11 And he lighted 6293-4 upon a certain place, 4725 and tarried there all night, 3885-4 because the sun 8121 was set; 935-1 and he took 3947-4 of the stones 68 of that place, 4725 and put 7760-4 [them for] his pillows, 4763 and lay down 7901-4 in that place 4725 to sleep.
28:12 And he dreamed, 2492-4 and behold a ladder 5551 set up 5324-94 on the earth, 776 and the top of it 7218 reached 5060-56 to heaven: 8064 and behold the angels 4397 of God 430 ascending 5927-6 and descending 3381-6 on it.
28:13 And, behold, the LORD 3068 stood 5324-12 above it, and said, 559-4 I [am] the LORD 3068 God 430 of Abraham 85 thy father, 1 and the God 430 of Isaac: 3327 the land 776 whereon thou liest, 7901-6 to thee will I give 5414-4 it, and to thy seed; 2233
28:14 And thy seed 2233 shall be as the dust 6083 of the earth, 776 and thou shalt spread abroad 6555-1 to the west, 3220 and to the east, 6924 and to the north, 6828 and to the south: 5045 and in thee and in thy seed 2233 shall all the families 4940 of the earth 127 be blessed. 1288-8
28:15 And, behold, I [am] with thee, and will keep 8104-1 thee in all [places] whither 834 thou goest, 3212-4 and will bring thee again 7725-52 into this land; 127 for I will not leave 5800-4 thee, until 834 I have done 6213-1 [that] which I have spoken 1696-14 to thee of.
28:16 And Jacob 3290 awaked 3364-4 out of his sleep, 8142 and he said, 559-4 Surely 403 the LORD 3068 is 3426 in this place; 4725 and I knew 3045-1 [it] not.
28:17 And he was afraid, 3372-4 and said, 559-4 How dreadful 3372-12 [is] this place! 4725 this [is] none other but the house 1004 of God, 430 and this [is] the gate 8179 of heaven. 8064
28:18 And Jacob 3290 rose up early 7925-55 in the morning, 1242 and took 3947-4 the stone 68 that he had put 7760-1 [for] his pillows, 4763 and set it up 7760-4 [for] a pillar, 4676 and poured 3332-4 oil 8081 upon the top of it. 7218
28:19 And he called 7121-4 the name 8034 of that place 4725 Bethel: 1008 but 199 the name 8034 of that city 5892 [was called] Luz 3870 at the first. 7223
28:20 And Jacob 3290 vowed 5087-4 a vow, 5088 saying, 559-2 If God 430 will be with me, and will keep 8104-1 me in this way 1870 that I go, 1980-6 and will give 5414-1 me bread 3899 to eat, 398-2 and raiment 899 to put on, 3847-2
28:21 So that I come again 7725-1 to my father's 1 house 1004 in peace; 7965 then shall the LORD 3068 be my God: 430
28:22 And this stone, 68 which I have set 7760-1 [for] a pillar, 4676 shall be God's 430 house: 1004 and of all that thou shalt give 5414-4 me I will surely 6237-15 give the tenth 6237-17 unto thee.
29:1 Then Jacob 3290 went on 5375-4 his journey, 7272 and came 3212-4 into the land 776 of the people 1121 of the east. 6924
29:2 And he looked, 7200-4 and behold a well 875 in the field, 7704 and, lo, there [were] three 7969 flocks 5739 of sheep 6629 lying 7257-6 by it; for out of that well 875 they watered 8248-55 the flocks: 5739 and a great 1419 stone 68 [was] upon the well's 875 mouth. 6310
29:3 And thither were all the flocks 5739 gathered: 622-8 and they rolled 1556-1 the stone 68 from the well's 875 mouth, 6310 and watered 8248-52 the sheep, 6629 and put the stone 68 again 7725-52 upon the well's 875 mouth 6310 in his place. 4725
29:4 And Jacob 3290 said 559-4 unto them, My brethren, 251 whence 370 [be] ye? 859 And they said, 559-4 Of Haran 2771 [are] we.
29:5 And he said 559-4 unto them, Know 3045-1 ye Laban 3837 the son 1121 of Nahor? 5152 And they said, 559-4 We know 3045-1 [him].
29:6 And he said 559-4 unto them, [Is] he well? 7965 And they said, 559-4 [He is] well: 7965 and, behold, Rachel 7354 his daughter 1323 cometh 935-6 with the sheep. 6629
29:7 And he said, 559-4 Lo, 2005 [it is] yet high 1419 day, 3117 neither [is it] time 6256 that the cattle 4735 should be gathered 622-9 together: water 8248-54 ye the sheep, 6629 and go 3212-3 [and] feed 7462-3 [them].
29:8 And they said, 559-4 We cannot, 3808 3201-4 until all the flocks 5739 be gathered 622-11 together, and [till] they roll 1556-1 the stone 68 from the well's 875 mouth; 6310 then we water 8248-52 the sheep. 6629
29:9 And while he yet 5750 spake 1696-18 with them, Rachel 7354 came 935-1 with her father's 1 sheep: 6629 for she kept 7462-6 them.
29:10 And it came to pass, when Jacob 3290 saw 7200-1 Rachel 7354 the daughter 1323 of Laban 3837 his mother's 517 brother, 251 and the sheep 6629 of Laban 3837 his mother's 517 brother, 251 that Jacob 3290 went near, 5066-4 and rolled 1556-55 the stone 68 from the well's 875 mouth, 6310 and watered 8248-55 the flock 6629 of Laban 3837 his mother's 517 brother. 251
29:11 And Jacob 3290 kissed 5401-4 Rachel, 7354 and lifted up 5375-4 his voice, 6963 and wept. 1058-4
29:12 And Jacob 3290 told 5046-55 Rachel 7354 that he [was] her father's 1 brother, 251 and that he [was] Rebekah's 7259 son: 1121 and she ran 7323-4 and told 5046-55 her father. 1
29:13 And it came to pass, when Laban 3837 heard 8085-2 the tidings 8088 of Jacob 3290 his sister's 269 son, 1121 that he ran 7323-4 to meet 7125-2 him, and embraced 2263-17 him, and kissed 5401-17 him, and brought 935-55 him to his house. 1004 And he told 5608-17 Laban 3837 all these things. 1697
29:14 And Laban 3837 said 559-4 to him, Surely 389 thou [art] my bone 6106 and my flesh. 1320 And he abode 3427-4 with him the space 3117 of a month. 2320
29:15 And Laban 3837 said 559-4 unto Jacob, 3290 Because thou [art] my brother, 251 shouldest thou therefore serve 5647-1 me for nought? 2600 tell 5046-54 me, what [shall] thy wages 4909 [be]?
29:16 And Laban 3837 had two 8147 daughters: 1323 the name 8034 of the elder 1419 [was] Leah, 3812 and the name 8034 of the younger 6996 [was] Rachel. 7354
29:17 Leah 3812 [was] tender 7390 eyed; 5869 but Rachel 7354 was beautiful 3303 8389 and well 3303 favoured. 4758
29:18 And Jacob 3290 loved 157-4 Rachel; 7354 and said, 559-4 I will serve 5647-4 thee seven 7651 years 8141 for Rachel 7354 thy younger 6996 daughter. 1323
29:19 And Laban 3837 said, 559-4 [It is] better 2896 that I give 5414-2 her to thee, than that I should give 5414-2 her to another 312 man: 376 abide 3427-3 with me.
29:20 And Jacob 3290 served 5647-4 seven 7651 years 8141 for Rachel; 7354 and they seemed 5869 unto him [but] a few 259 days, 3117 for the love he had 160 to her.
29:21 And Jacob 3290 said 559-4 unto Laban, 3837 Give 3051-3 [me] my wife, 802 for my days 3117 are fulfilled, 4390-1 that I may go in 935-4 unto her.
29:22 And Laban 3837 gathered 622-4 together all the men 582 of the place, 4725 and made 6213-4 a feast. 4960
29:23 And it came to pass in the evening, 6153 that he took 3947-4 Leah 3812 his daughter, 1323 and brought 935-55 her to him; and he went in 935-4 unto her.
29:24 And Laban 3837 gave 5414-4 unto his daughter 1323 Leah 3812 Zilpah 2153 his maid 8198 [for] an handmaid. 8198
29:25 And it came to pass, that in the morning, 1242 behold, it [was] Leah: 3812 and he said 559-4 to Laban, 3837 What [is] this thou hast done 6213-1 unto me? did not I serve 5647-1 with thee for Rachel? 7354 wherefore then hast thou beguiled 7411-14 me?
29:26 And Laban 3837 said, 559-4 It must not be so done 6213-11 in our country, 4725 to give 5414-2 the younger 6810 before 6440 the firstborn. 1067
29:27 Fulfil 4390-16 her 2063 week, 7620 and we will give 5414-4 thee this 2063 also for the service 5656 which thou shalt serve 5647-4 with me yet seven 7651 other 312 years. 8141
29:28 And Jacob 3290 did 6213-4 so, and fulfilled 4390-17 her week: 7620 and he gave 5414-4 him Rachel 7354 his daughter 1323 to wife 802 also.
29:29 And Laban 3837 gave 5414-4 to Rachel 7354 his daughter 1323 Bilhah 1090 his handmaid 8198 to be her maid. 8198
29:30 And he went in 935-4 also unto Rachel, 7354 and he loved 157-4 also Rachel 7354 more than Leah, 3812 and served 5647-4 with him yet seven 7651 other 312 years. 8141
29:31 And when the LORD 3068 saw 7200-4 that Leah 3812 [was] hated, 8130-7 he opened 6605-4 her womb: 7358 but Rachel 7354 [was] barren. 6135
29:32 And Leah 3812 conceived, 2029-4 and bare 3205-4 a son, 1121 and she called 7121-4 his name 8034 Reuben: 7205 for 3588 she said, 559-1 Surely 3588 the LORD 3068 hath looked 7200-1 upon my affliction; 6040 now therefore 3588 my husband 376 will love 157-4 me.
29:33 And she conceived 2029-4 again, and bare 3205-4 a son; 1121 and said, 559-4 Because the LORD 3068 hath heard 8085-1 that I [was] hated, 8130-7 he hath therefore given 5414-4 me this [son] also: and she called 7121-4 his name 8034 Simeon. 8095
29:34 And she conceived 2029-4 again, and bare 3205-4 a son; 1121 and said, 559-4 Now this time 6471 will my husband 376 be joined 3867-11 unto me, because I have born 3205-1 him three 7969 sons: 1121 therefore was his name 8034 called 7121-1 Levi. 3878
29:35 And she conceived 2029-4 again, and bare 3205-4 a son: 1121 and she said, 559-4 Now 6471 will I praise 3034-55 the LORD: 3068 therefore she called 7121-1 his name 8034 Judah; 3063 and left 5975-4 bearing. 3205-2
30:1 And when Rachel 7354 saw 7200-4 that she bare 3205-1 Jacob 3290 no children, Rachel 7354 envied 7065-17 her sister; 269 and said 559-4 unto Jacob, 3290 Give 3051-3 me children, 1121 or else 369 I die. 4191-5
30:2 And Jacob's 3290 anger 639 was kindled 2734-4 against Rachel: 7354 and he said, 559-4 [Am] I in God's 430 stead, who hath withheld 4513-1 from thee the fruit 6529 of the womb? 990
30:3 And she said, 559-4 Behold my maid 519 Bilhah, 1090 go in 935-3 unto her; and she shall bear 3205-4 upon my knees, 1290 that I may also have children 1129-11 by her.
30:4 And she gave 5414-4 him Bilhah 1090 her handmaid 8198 to wife: 802 and Jacob 3290 went in 935-4 unto her.
30:5 And Bilhah 1090 conceived, 2029-4 and bare 3205-4 Jacob 3290 a son. 1121
30:6 And Rachel 7354 said, 559-4 God 430 hath judged 1777-1 me, and hath also heard 8085-1 my voice, 6963 and hath given 5414-4 me a son: 1121 therefore called 7121-1 she his name 8034 Dan. 1835
30:7 And Bilhah 1090 Rachel's 7354 maid 8198 conceived 2029-4 again, and bare 3205-4 Jacob 3290 a second 8145 son. 1121
30:8 And Rachel 7354 said, 559-4 With great 430 wrestlings 5319 have I wrestled 6617-8 with my sister, 269 and I have prevailed: 3201-1 and she called 7121-4 his name 8034 Naphtali. 5321
30:9 When Leah 3812 saw 7200-4 that she had left 5975-1 bearing, 3205-2 she took 3947-4 Zilpah 2153 her maid, 8198 and gave 5414-4 her Jacob 3290 to wife. 802
30:10 And Zilpah 2153 Leah's 3812 maid 8198 bare 3205-4 Jacob 3290 a son. 1121
30:11 And Leah 3812 said, 559-4 A troop 1409 cometh: 935-1 and she called 7121-4 his name 8034 Gad. 1410
30:12 And Zilpah 2153 Leah's 3812 maid 8198 bare 3205-4 Jacob 3290 a second 8145 son. 1121
30:13 And Leah 3812 said, 559-4 Happy am I, 837 for the daughters 1323 will call me blessed: 833-14 and she called 7121-4 his name 8034 Asher. 836
30:14 And Reuben 7205 went in 3212-4 the days 3117 of wheat 2406 harvest, 7105 and found 4672-4 mandrakes 1736 in the field, 7704 and brought 935-55 them unto his mother 517 Leah. 3812 Then Rachel 7354 said 559-4 to Leah, 3812 Give 5414-3 me, I pray thee, of thy son's 1121 mandrakes. 1736
30:15 And she said 559-4 unto her, [Is it] a small matter 4592 that thou hast taken 3947-2 my husband? 376 and wouldest thou take away 3947-2 my son's 1121 mandrakes 1736 also? And Rachel 7354 said, 559-4 Therefore he shall lie 7901-4 with thee to night 3915 for 8478 thy son's 1121 mandrakes. 1736
30:16 And Jacob 3290 came 935-4 out of the field 7704 in the evening, 6153 and Leah 3812 went out 3318-4 to meet 7125-2 him, and said, 559-4 Thou must come in 935-4 unto me; for surely 7936-2 I have hired 7936-1 thee with my son's 1121 mandrakes. 1736 And he lay 7901-4 with her that night. 3915
30:17 And God 430 hearkened 8085-4 unto Leah, 3812 and she conceived, 2029-4 and bare 3205-4 Jacob 3290 the fifth 2549 son. 1121
30:18 And Leah 3812 said, 559-4 God 430 hath given 5414-1 me my hire, 7939 because 834 I have given 5414-1 my maiden 8198 to my husband: 376 and she called 7121-4 his name 8034 Issachar. 3485
30:19 And Leah 3812 conceived 2029-4 again, and bare 3205-4 Jacob 3290 the sixth 8345 son. 1121
30:20 And Leah 3812 said, 559-4 God 430 hath endued 2064-1 me [with] a good 2896 dowry; 2065 now 6471 will my husband 376 dwell 2082-4 with me, because I have born 3205-1 him six 8337 sons: 1121 and she called 7121-4 his name 8034 Zebulun. 2074
30:21 And afterwards 310 she bare 3205-1 a daughter, 1323 and called 7121-4 her name 8034 Dinah. 1783
30:22 And God 430 remembered 2142-4 Rachel, 7354 and God 430 hearkened 8085-4 to her, and opened 6605-4 her womb. 7358
30:23 And she conceived, 2029-4 and bare 3205-4 a son; 1121 and said, 559-4 God 430 hath taken away 622-1 my reproach: 2781
30:24 And she called 7121-4 his name 8034 Joseph; 3130 and said, 559-2 The LORD 3068 shall add 3254-55 to me another 312 son. 1121
30:25 And it came to pass, when Rachel 7354 had born 3205-1 Joseph, 3130 that Jacob 3290 said 559-4 unto Laban, 3837 Send me away, 7971-16 that I may go 3212-4 unto mine own place, 4725 and to my country. 776
30:26 Give 5414-3 [me] my wives 802 and my children, 3206 for whom 2004 I have served 5647-1 thee, and let me go: 3212-4 for thou knowest 3045-1 my service 5656 which I have done 5647-1 thee.
30:27 And Laban 3837 said 559-4 unto him, I pray thee, if I have found 4672-1 favour 2580 in thine eyes, 5869 [tarry: for] I have learned by experience 5172-14 that the LORD 3068 hath blessed 1288-17 me for thy sake. 1558
30:28 And he said, 559-4 Appoint 5344-3 me thy wages, 7939 and I will give 5414-4 [it].
30:29 And he said 559-4 unto him, Thou knowest 3045-1 how 834 I have served 5647-1 thee, and how 834 thy cattle 4735 was with me.
30:30 For [it was] little 4592 which thou hadst before 6440 I [came], and it is [now] increased 6555-4 unto a multitude; 7230 and the LORD 3068 hath blessed 1288-17 thee since my coming: 7272 and now when 4970 shall I provide 6213-4 for mine own house 1004 also?
30:31 And he said, 559-4 What shall I give 5414-4 thee? And Jacob 3290 said, 559-4 Thou shalt not give 5414-4 me any thing: 3972 if thou wilt do 6213-4 this thing 1697 for me, I will again 7725-4 feed 7462-4 [and] keep 8104-4 thy flock: 6629
30:32 I will pass through 5674-4 all thy flock 6629 to day, 3117 removing 5493-53 from thence all the speckled 5348 and spotted 2921-7 cattle, 7716 and all the brown 2345 cattle 7716 among the sheep, 3775 and the spotted 2921-7 and speckled 5348 among the goats: 5795 and [of such] shall be my hire. 7939
30:33 So shall my righteousness 6666 answer 6030-1 for me in time 3117 to come, 4279 when it shall come 935-4 for my hire 7939 before thy face: 6440 every one 3605 that [is] not speckled 5348 and spotted 2921-7 among the goats, 5795 and brown 2345 among the sheep, 3775 that shall be counted stolen 1589-7 with me.
30:34 And Laban 3837 said, 559-4 Behold, I would 3863 it might be according to thy word. 1697
30:35 And he removed 5493-55 that day 3117 the he goats 8495 that were ringstraked 6124 and spotted, 2921-7 and all the she goats 5795 that were speckled 5348 and spotted, 2921-7 [and] every one that had [some] white 3836 in it, and all the brown 2345 among the sheep, 3775 and gave 5414-4 [them] into the hand 3027 of his sons. 1121
30:36 And he set 7760-4 three 7969 days' 3117 journey 1870 betwixt himself and Jacob: 3290 and Jacob 3290 fed 7462-6 the rest 3498-12 of Laban's 3837 flocks. 6629
30:37 And Jacob 3290 took 3947-4 him rods 4731 of green 3892 poplar, 3839 and of the hazel 3869 and chesnut tree; 6196 and pilled 6478-17 white 3836 strakes 6479 in them, and made the white 3836 appear 4286 which [was] in the rods. 4731
30:38 And he set 3322-55 the rods 4731 which he had pilled 6478-14 before 5227 the flocks 6629 in the gutters 7298 in the watering 4325 troughs 8268 when the flocks 6629 came 935-4 to drink, 8354-2 that they should conceive 3179-4 when they came 935-2 to drink. 8354-2
30:39 And the flocks 6629 conceived 3179-4 before the rods, 4731 and brought forth 3205-4 cattle 6629 ringstraked, 6124 speckled, 5348 and spotted. 2921-7
30:40 And Jacob 3290 did separate 6504-52 the lambs, 3775 and set 5414-4 the faces 6440 of the flocks 6629 toward 413 the ringstraked, 6124 and all the brown 2345 in the flock 6629 of Laban; 3837 and he put 7896-4 his own flocks 5739 by themselves, and put 7896-1 them not unto Laban's 3837 cattle. 6629
30:41 And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger 7194-30 cattle 6629 did conceive, 3179-15 that Jacob 3290 laid 7760-1 the rods 4731 before the eyes 5869 of the cattle 6629 in the gutters, 7298 that they might conceive 3179-15 among the rods. 4731
30:42 But when the cattle 6629 were feeble, 5848-53 he put [them] not in: 7760-4 so the feebler 5848-7 were Laban's, 3837 and the stronger 7194-7 Jacob's. 3290
30:43 And the man 376 increased 6555-4 exceedingly, 3966 3966 and had much 7227 cattle, 6629 and maidservants, 8198 and menservants, 5650 and camels, 1581 and asses. 2543
31:1 And he heard 8085-4 the words 1697 of Laban's 3837 sons, 1121 saying, 559-2 Jacob 3290 hath taken away 3947-1 all that [was] our father's; 1 and of [that] which [was] our father's 1 hath he gotten 6213-1 all this glory. 3519
31:2 And Jacob 3290 beheld 7200-4 the countenance 6440 of Laban, 3837 and, behold, it [was] not toward him as 8543 before. 8032
31:3 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Jacob, 3290 Return 7725-3 unto the land 776 of thy fathers, 1 and to thy kindred; 4138 and I will be with thee.
31:4 And Jacob 3290 sent 7971-4 and called 7121-4 Rachel 7354 and Leah 3812 to the field 7704 unto his flock, 6629
31:5 And said 559-4 unto them, I see 7200-6 your father's 1 countenance, 6440 that it [is] not toward me as 8543 before; 8032 but the God 430 of my father 1 hath been 1961-1 with me.
31:6 And ye 859 know 3045-1 that with all my power 3581 I have served 5647-1 your father. 1
31:7 And your father 1 hath deceived 2048-14 me, and changed 2498-52 my wages 4909 ten 6235 times; 4489 but God 430 suffered 5414-1 him not to hurt 7489-53 me. 5978
31:8 If he said 559-4 thus, The speckled 5348 shall be thy wages; 7939 then all the cattle 6629 bare 3205-1 speckled: 5348 and if he said 559-4 thus, The ringstraked 6124 shall be thy hire; 7939 then bare 3205-1 all the cattle 6629 ringstraked. 6124
31:9 Thus God 430 hath taken away 5337-55 the cattle 4735 of your father, 1 and given 5414-4 [them] to me.
31:10 And it came to pass at the time 6256 that the cattle 6629 conceived, 3179-15 that I lifted up 5375-4 mine eyes, 5869 and saw 7200-4 in a dream, 2472 and, behold, the rams 6260 which leaped 5927-6 upon the cattle 6629 [were] ringstraked, 6124 speckled, 5348 and grisled. 1261
31:11 And the angel 4397 of God 430 spake 559-4 unto me in a dream, 2472 [saying], Jacob: 3290 And I said, 559-4 Here [am] I.
31:12 And he said, 559-4 Lift up 5375-3 now thine eyes, 5869 and see, 7200-3 all the rams 6260 which leap 5927-6 upon the cattle 6629 [are] ringstraked, 6124 speckled, 5348 and grisled: 1261 for I have seen 7200-1 all that Laban 3837 doeth 6213-6 unto thee.
31:13 I [am] the God 410 of Bethel, 1008 where thou anointedst 4886-1 the pillar, 4676 [and] where thou vowedst 5087-1 a vow 5088 unto me: now arise, 6965-3 get thee out 3318-3 from this land, 776 and return 7725-3 unto the land 776 of thy kindred. 4138
31:14 And Rachel 7354 and Leah 3812 answered 6030-4 and said 559-4 unto him, [Is there] yet any portion 2506 or inheritance 5159 for us in our father's 1 house? 1004
31:15 Are we not counted 2803-8 of him strangers? 5237 for he hath sold 4376-1 us, and hath quite 398-2 devoured 398-4 also our money. 3701
31:16 For all the riches 6239 which God 430 hath taken 5337-52 from our father, 1 that [is] ours, and our children's: 1121 now then, whatsoever God 430 hath said 559-1 unto thee, do. 6213-3
31:17 Then Jacob 3290 rose up, 6965-4 and set 5375-4 his sons 1121 and his wives 802 upon camels; 1581
31:18 And he carried away 5090-4 all his cattle, 4735 and all his goods 7399 which he had gotten, 7408-1 the cattle 4735 of his getting, 7075 which he had gotten 7408-1 in Padanaram, 6307 for to go 935-2 to Isaac 3327 his father 1 in the land 776 of Canaan. 3667
31:19 And Laban 3837 went 1980-1 to shear 1494-2 his sheep: 6629 and Rachel 7354 had stolen 1589-4 the images 8655 that [were] her father's. 1
31:20 And Jacob 3290 stole away 1589-4 unawares 3820 to Laban 3837 the Syrian, 761 in that 5921 he told 5046-52 him not 1097 that he fled. 1272-6
31:21 So he fled 1272-4 with all that he had; and he rose up, 6965-4 and passed over 5674-4 the river, 5104 and set 7760-4 his face 6440 [toward] the mount 2022 Gilead. 1568
31:22 And it was told 5046-93 Laban 3837 on the third 7992 day 3117 that Jacob 3290 was fled. 1272-1
31:23 And he took 3947-4 his brethren 251 with him, and pursued 7291-4 after him 310 seven 7651 days' 3117 journey; 1870 and they overtook 1692-55 him in the mount 2022 Gilead. 1568
31:24 And God 430 came 935-4 to Laban 3837 the Syrian 761 in a dream 2472 by night, 3915 and said 559-4 unto him, Take heed 8104-10 that thou speak 1696-17 not to 5973 Jacob 3290 either good 2896 or 5704 bad. 7451
31:25 Then Laban 3837 overtook 5381-55 Jacob. 3290 Now Jacob 3290 had pitched 8628-1 his tent 168 in the mount: 2022 and Laban 3837 with his brethren 251 pitched 8628-1 in the mount 2022 of Gilead. 1568
31:26 And Laban 3837 said 559-4 to Jacob, 3290 What hast thou done, 6213-1 that thou hast stolen away 1589-4 unawares 3824 to me, and carried away 5090-17 my daughters, 1323 as captives 7617-7 [taken] with the sword? 2719
31:27 Wherefore didst thou flee away 1272-2 secretly, 2244-8 and steal away 1589-4 from me; and didst not tell 5046-52 me, that I might have sent thee away 7971-17 with mirth, 8057 and with songs, 7892 with tabret, 8596 and with harp? 3658
31:28 And hast not suffered 5203-1 me to kiss 5401-15 my sons 1121 and my daughters? 1323 thou hast now done foolishly 5528-52 in [so] doing. 6213-2
31:29 It is 3426 in the power 410 of my hand 3027 to do 6213-2 you hurt: 7451 but the God 430 of your father 1 spake 559-1 unto me yesternight, 570 saying, 559-2 Take thou heed 8104-10 that thou speak not 1696-15 to Jacob 3290 either good 2896 or bad. 7451
31:30 And now, [though] thou wouldest needs 1980-2 be gone, 1980-1 because thou sore 3700-9 longedst 3700-8 after thy father's 1 house, 1004 [yet] wherefore hast thou stolen 1589-1 my gods? 430
31:31 And Jacob 3290 answered 6030-4 and said 559-4 to Laban, 3837 Because I was afraid: 3372-1 for I said, 559-1 Peradventure 6435 thou wouldest take by force 1497-4 thy daughters 1323 from me.
31:32 With whomsoever 834 thou findest 4672-4 thy gods, 430 let him not live: 2421-4 before 5048 our brethren 251 discern 5234-54 thou what [is] thine with me, and take 3947-3 [it] to thee. For Jacob 3290 knew 3045-1 not that Rachel 7354 had stolen 1589-1 them.
31:33 And Laban 3837 went 935-4 into Jacob's 3290 tent, 168 and into Leah's 3812 tent, 168 and into the two 8147 maidservants' 519 tents; 168 but he found 4672-1 [them] not. Then went he out 3318-4 of Leah's 3812 tent, 168 and entered 935-4 into Rachel's 7354 tent. 168
31:34 Now Rachel 7354 had taken 3947-1 the images, 8655 and put 7760-4 them in the camel's 1581 furniture, 3733 and sat 3427-4 upon them. And Laban 3837 searched 4959-17 all the tent, 168 but found 4672-1 [them] not.
31:35 And she said 559-4 to her father, 1 Let it not displease 2734-4 5869 my lord 113 that I cannot 3808 3201-4 rise up 6965-2 before 6440 thee; for the custom 1870 of women 802 [is] upon me. And he searched, 2664-17 but found 4672-1 not the images. 8655
31:36 And Jacob 3290 was wroth, 2734-4 and chode 7378-4 with Laban: 3837 and Jacob 3290 answered 6030-4 and said 559-4 to Laban, 3837 What [is] my trespass? 6588 what [is] my sin, 2403 that thou hast so hotly pursued 1814-1 after 310 me?
31:37 Whereas 3588 thou hast searched 4959-14 all my stuff, 3627 what hast thou found 4672-1 of all thy household 1004 stuff? 3627 set 7760-3 [it] here 3541 before my brethren 251 and thy brethren, 251 that they may judge 3198-55 betwixt 996 us both. 8147
31:38 This twenty 6242 years 8141 [have] I [been] with thee; thy ewes 7353 and thy she goats 5795 have not cast their young, 7921-14 and the rams 352 of thy flock 6629 have I not eaten. 398-1
31:39 That which was torn 2966 [of beasts] I brought 935-52 not unto thee; I bare the loss 2398-17 of it; of my hand 3027 didst thou require 1245-17 it, [whether] stolen 1589-7 by day, 3117 or stolen 1589-7 by night. 3915
31:40 [Thus] I was; in the day 3117 the drought 2721 consumed 398-1 me, and the frost 7140 by night; 3915 and my sleep 8142 departed 5074-4 from mine eyes. 5869
31:41 Thus have I been twenty 6242 years 8141 in thy house; 1004 I served 5647-1 thee fourteen 702 6240 years 8141 for thy two 8147 daughters, 1323 and six 8337 years 8141 for thy cattle: 6629 and thou hast changed 2498-55 my wages 4909 ten 6235 times. 4489
31:42 Except 3884 the God 430 of my father, 1 the God 430 of Abraham, 85 and the fear 6343 of Isaac, 3327 had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away 7971-14 now empty. 7387 God 430 hath seen 7200-1 mine affliction 6040 and the labour 3018 of my hands, 3709 and rebuked 3198-55 [thee] yesternight. 570
31:43 And Laban 3837 answered 6030-4 and said 559-4 unto Jacob, 3290 [These] daughters 1323 [are] my daughters, 1323 and [these] children 1121 [are] my children, 1121 and [these] cattle 6629 [are] my cattle, 6629 and all that thou seest 7200-6 [is] mine: and what can I do 6213-4 this day 3117 unto these my daughters, 1323 or 176 unto their children 1121 which they have born? 3205-1
31:44 Now therefore come 3212-3 thou, let us make 3772-4 a covenant, 1285 I and thou; and let it be for a witness 5707 between me and thee.
31:45 And Jacob 3290 took 3947-4 a stone, 68 and set it up 7311-55 [for] a pillar. 4676
31:46 And Jacob 3290 said 559-4 unto his brethren, 251 Gather 3950-3 stones; 68 and they took 3947-4 stones, 68 and made 6213-4 an heap: 1530 and they did eat 398-4 there upon the heap. 1530
31:47 And Laban 3837 called 7121-4 it Jegarsahadutha: 3026 but Jacob 3290 called 7121-1 it Galeed. 1530|5707|1567
31:48 And Laban 3837 said, 559-4 This heap 1530 [is] a witness 5707 between me and thee this day. 3117 Therefore was the name 8034 of it called 7121-1 Galeed; 1567
31:49 And Mizpah; 4709 for 834 he said, 559-1 The LORD 3068 watch 6822-4 between me and thee, when we are absent 5641-11 one 376 from another. 7453
31:50 If thou shalt afflict 6031-17 my daughters, 1323 or if thou shalt take 3947-4 [other] wives 802 beside 5921 my daughters, 1323 no man 376 [is] with us; see, 7200-3 God 430 [is] witness 5707 betwixt me and thee.
31:51 And Laban 3837 said 559-4 to Jacob, 3290 Behold this heap, 1530 and behold [this] pillar, 4676 which I have cast 3384-1 betwixt me and thee;
31:52 This heap 1530 [be] witness, 5707 and [this] pillar 4676 [be] witness, 5713 that I will not pass over 5674-4 this heap 1530 to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over 5674-4 this heap 1530 and this pillar 4676 unto me, for harm. 7451
31:53 The God 430 of Abraham, 85 and the God 430 of Nahor, 5152 the God 430 of their father, 1 judge 8199-4 betwixt us. And Jacob 3290 sware 7650-11 by the fear 6343 of his father 1 Isaac. 3327
31:54 Then Jacob 3290 offered 2076-4 sacrifice 2077 upon the mount, 2022 and called 7121-4 his brethren 251 to eat 398-2 bread: 3899 and they did eat 398-4 bread, 3899 and tarried all night 3885-4 in the mount. 2022
31:55 And early in the morning 1242 Laban 3837 rose up, 7925-55 and kissed 5401-17 his sons 1121 and his daughters, 1323 and blessed 1288-17 them: and Laban 3837 departed, 3212-4 and returned 7725-4 unto his place. 4725
32:1 And Jacob 3290 went 1980-1 on his way, 1870 and the angels 4397 of God 430 met 6293-4 him.
32:2 And when Jacob 3290 saw 7200-1 them, he said, 559-4 This [is] God's 430 host: 4264 and he called 7121-4 the name 8034 of that place 4725 Mahanaim. 4266
32:3 And Jacob 3290 sent 7971-4 messengers 4397 before 6440 him to Esau 6215 his brother 251 unto the land 776 of Seir, 8165 the country 7704 of Edom. 123
32:4 And he commanded 6680-17 them, saying, 559-2 Thus shall ye speak 559-4 unto my lord 113 Esau; 6215 Thy servant 5650 Jacob 3290 saith 559-1 thus, I have sojourned 1481-1 with Laban, 3837 and stayed there 309-4 until now:
32:5 And I have oxen, 7794 and asses, 2543 flocks, 6629 and menservants, 5650 and womenservants: 8198 and I have sent 7971-4 to tell 5046-53 my lord, 113 that I may find 4672-2 grace 2580 in thy sight. 5869
32:6 And the messengers 4397 returned 7725-4 to Jacob, 3290 saying, 559-2 We came 935-1 to thy brother 251 Esau, 6215 and also he cometh 1980-6 to meet 7125-2 thee, and four 702 hundred 3967 men 376 with him.
32:7 Then Jacob 3290 was greatly 3966 afraid 3372-4 and distressed: 3334-4 and he divided 2673-4 the people 5971 that [was] with him, and the flocks, 6629 and herds, 1241 and the camels, 1581 into two 8147 bands; 4264
32:8 And said, 559-4 If Esau 6215 come 935-4 to the one 259 company, 4264 and smite 5221-52 it, then the other company 4264 which is left 7604-12 shall escape. 6413
32:9 And Jacob 3290 said, 559-4 O God 430 of my father 1 Abraham, 85 and God 430 of my father 1 Isaac, 3327 the LORD 3068 which saidst 559-6 unto me, Return 7725-3 unto thy country, 776 and to thy kindred, 4138 and I will deal well 3190-55 with thee:
32:10 I am not worthy 6994-1 of the least of all the mercies, 2617 and of all the truth, 571 which thou hast shewed 6213-1 unto thy servant; 5650 for with my staff 4731 I passed over 5674-1 this Jordan; 3383 and now I am become two 8147 bands. 4264
32:11 Deliver 5337-54 me, I pray thee, from the hand 3027 of my brother, 251 from the hand 3027 of Esau: 6215 for I fear 3373 him, lest he will come 935-4 and smite 5221-52 me, [and] the mother 517 with 5921 the children. 1121
32:12 And thou saidst, 559-1 I will surely 3190-53 do thee good, 3190-55 and make 7760-1 thy seed 2233 as the sand 2344 of the sea, 3220 which cannot be numbered 5608-11 for multitude. 7230
32:13 And he lodged 3885-4 there that same night; 3915 and took 3947-4 of that which came 935-6 to his hand 3027 a present 4503 for Esau 6215 his brother; 251
32:14 Two hundred 3967 she goats, 5795 and twenty 6242 he goats, 8495 two hundred 3967 ewes, 7353 and twenty 6242 rams, 352
32:15 Thirty 7970 milch 3243-56 camels 1581 with their colts, 1121 forty 705 kine, 6510 and ten 6235 bulls, 6499 twenty 6242 she asses, 860 and ten 6235 foals. 5895
32:16 And he delivered 5414-4 [them] into the hand 3027 of his servants, 5650 every drove 5739 5739 by themselves; and said 559-4 unto his servants, 5650 Pass over 5674-3 before 6440 me, and put 7760-4 a space 7305 betwixt 996 drove 5739 and 996 drove. 5739
32:17 And he commanded 6680-17 the foremost, 7223 saying, 559-2 When Esau 6215 my brother 251 meeteth 6298-4 thee, and asketh 7592-1 thee, saying, 559-2 Whose [art] thou? and whither goest 3212-4 thou? and whose [are] these before 6440 thee?
32:18 Then thou shalt say, 559-1 [They be] thy servant 5650 Jacob's; 3290 it [is] a present 4503 sent 7971-7 unto my lord 113 Esau: 6215 and, behold, also he [is] behind 310 us.
32:19 And so 1571 commanded 6680-17 he the second, 8145 and 1571 the third, 7992 and 1571 all that followed 1980-6 310 the droves, 5739 saying, 559-2 On this manner 1697 shall ye speak 1696-17 unto Esau, 6215 when ye find 4672-2 him.
32:20 And say 559-1 ye moreover, 1571 Behold, thy servant 5650 Jacob 3290 [is] behind 310 us. For he said, 559-1 I will appease 3722-17 him 6440 with the present 4503 that goeth 1980-6 before 6440 me, and afterward 310 I will see 7200-4 his face; 6440 peradventure he will accept 5375-4 of me. 6440
32:21 So went the present 4503 over 5674-4 before him: 6440 and himself lodged 3885-1 that night 3915 in the company. 4264
32:22 And he rose up 6965-4 that night, 3915 and took 3947-4 his two 8147 wives, 802 and his two 8147 womenservants, 8198 and his eleven 6240 259 sons, 3206 and passed over 5674-4 the ford 4569 Jabbok. 2999
32:23 And he took 3947-4 them, and sent them over 5674-55 the brook, 5158 and sent over 5674-55 that he had.
32:24 And Jacob 3290 was left 3498-11 alone; and there wrestled 79-11 a man 376 with him until the breaking 5927-2 of the day. 7837
32:25 And when he saw 7200-4 that he prevailed 3201-1 not against him, he touched 5060-4 the hollow 3709 of his thigh; 3409 and the hollow 3709 of Jacob's 3290 thigh 3409 was out of joint, 3363-4 as he wrestled 79-9 with him.
32:26 And he said, 559-4 Let me go, 7971-16 for the day 7837 breaketh. 5927-1 And he said, 559-4 I will not let thee go, 7971-17 except 518 thou bless 1288-14 me.
32:27 And he said 559-4 unto him, What [is] thy name? 8034 And he said, 559-4 Jacob. 3290
32:28 And he said, 559-4 Thy name 8034 shall be called 559-11 no more Jacob, 3290 but Israel: 3478 for as a prince hast thou power 8280-1 with God 430 and with men, 582 and hast prevailed. 3201-4
32:29 And Jacob 3290 asked 7592-4 [him], and said, 559-4 Tell 5046-54 [me], I pray thee, thy name. 8034 And he said, 559-4 Wherefore [is] it 2088 [that] thou dost ask 7592-4 after my name? 8034 And he blessed 1288-17 him there.
32:30 And Jacob 3290 called 7121-4 the name 8034 of the place 4725 Peniel: 6439 for I have seen 7200-1 God 430 face 6440 to face, 6440 and my life 5315 is preserved. 5337-11
32:31 And as he passed over 5674-1 Penuel 6439 the sun 8121 rose 2224-4 upon him, and he halted 6760-6 upon his thigh. 3409
32:32 Therefore the children 1121 of Israel 3478 eat 398-4 not [of] the sinew 1517 which shrank, 5384 which [is] upon the hollow 3709 of the thigh, 3409 unto this day: 3117 because he touched 5060-1 the hollow 3709 of Jacob's 3290 thigh 3409 in the sinew 1517 that shrank. 5384
33:1 And Jacob 3290 lifted up 5375-4 his eyes, 5869 and looked, 7200-4 and, behold, Esau 6215 came, 935-6 and with him four 702 hundred 3967 men. 376 And he divided 2673-4 the children 3206 unto Leah, 3812 and unto Rachel, 7354 and unto the two 8147 handmaids. 8198
33:2 And he put 7760-4 the handmaids 8198 and their children 3206 foremost, 7223 and Leah 3812 and her children 3206 after, 314 and Rachel 7354 and Joseph 3130 hindermost. 314
33:3 And he passed over 5674-1 before 6440 them, and bowed 7812-101 himself to the ground 776 seven 7651 times, 6471 until he came near 5066-2 to his brother. 251
33:4 And Esau 6215 ran 7323-4 to meet 7125-2 him, and embraced 2263-17 him, and fell 5307-4 on his neck, 6677 and kissed 5401-4 him: and they wept. 1058-4
33:5 And he lifted up 5375-4 his eyes, 5869 and saw 7200-4 the women 802 and the children; 3206 and said, 559-4 Who [are] those 428 with thee? And he said, 559-4 The children 3206 which God 430 hath graciously given 2603-1 thy servant. 5650
33:6 Then the handmaidens 8198 came near, 5066-4 they and their children, 3206 and they bowed 7812-101 themselves.
33:7 And Leah 3812 also with her children 3206 came near, 5066-4 and bowed 7812-101 themselves: and after 310 came Joseph 3130 near 5066-8 and Rachel, 7354 and they bowed 7812-101 themselves.
33:8 And he said, 559-4 What [meanest] thou by all this drove 4264 which I met? 6298-1 And he said, 559-4 [These are] to find 4672-2 grace 2580 in the sight 5869 of my lord. 113
33:9 And Esau 6215 said, 559-4 I have 3426 enough, 7227 my brother; 251 keep that thou hast unto thyself.
33:10 And Jacob 3290 said, 559-4 Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found 4672-1 grace 2580 in thy sight, 5869 then receive 3947-1 my present 4503 at my hand: 3027 for therefore I have seen 7200-1 thy face, 6440 as though I had seen 7200-2 the face 6440 of God, 430 and thou wast pleased 7521-4 with me.
33:11 Take, 3947-3 I pray thee, my blessing 1293 that is brought 935-90 to thee; because God 430 hath dealt graciously with me, 2603-1 and because I have 3426 enough. 3605 And he urged 6484-4 him, and he took 3947-4 [it].
33:12 And he said, 559-4 Let us take our journey, 5265-4 and let us go, 3212-4 and I will go 3212-4 before thee.
33:13 And he said 559-4 unto him, My lord 113 knoweth 3045-6 that the children 3206 [are] tender, 7390 and the flocks 6629 and herds 1241 with young 5763-6 [are] with me: and if men should overdrive 1849-1 them one 259 day, 3117 all the flock 6629 will die. 4191-1
33:14 Let my lord, 113 I pray thee, pass over 5674-4 before 6440 his servant: 5650 and I will lead on 5095-101 softly, 328 according as 7272 the cattle 4399 that goeth before 6440 me and the children 3206 be able to endure, 7272 until I come 935-4 unto my lord 113 unto Seir. 8165
33:15 And Esau 6215 said, 559-4 Let me now leave 3322-55 with thee [some] of the folk 5971 that [are] with me. And he said, 559-4 What 4100 needeth it? let me find 4672-4 grace 2580 in the sight 5869 of my lord. 113
33:16 So Esau 6215 returned 7725-4 that day 3117 on his way 1870 unto Seir. 8165
33:17 And Jacob 3290 journeyed 5265-1 to Succoth, 5523 and built 1129-4 him an house, 1004 and made 6213-1 booths 5521 for his cattle: 4735 therefore the name 8034 of the place 4725 is called 7121-1 Succoth. 5523
33:18 And Jacob 3290 came 935-4 to Shalem, 8004 a city 5892 of Shechem, 7927 which [is] in the land 776 of Canaan, 3667 when he came 935-2 from Padanaram; 6307 and pitched his tent 2583-4 before 6440 the city. 5892
33:19 And he bought 7069-4 a parcel 2513 of a field, 7704 where he had spread 5186-1 his tent, 168 at the hand 3027 of the children 1121 of Hamor, 2544 Shechem's 7928 father, 1 for an hundred 3967 pieces of money. 7192
33:20 And he erected 5324-55 there an altar, 4196 and called 7121-4 it Elelohe-Israel. 415
34:1 And Dinah 1783 the daughter 1323 of Leah, 3812 which she bare 3205-1 unto Jacob, 3290 went out 3318-4 to see 7200-2 the daughters 1323 of the land. 776
34:2 And when Shechem 7928 the son 1121 of Hamor 2544 the Hivite, 2340 prince 5387 of the country, 776 saw 7200-4 her, he took 3947-4 her, and lay 7901-4 with her, and defiled her. 6031-17
34:3 And his soul 5315 clave 1692-4 unto Dinah 1783 the daughter 1323 of Jacob, 3290 and he loved 157-4 the damsel, 5291 and spake 1696-17 kindly 3820 unto the damsel. 5291
34:4 And Shechem 7928 spake 559-4 unto his father 1 Hamor, 2544 saying, 559-2 Get 3947-3 me this damsel 3207 to wife. 802
34:5 And Jacob 3290 heard 8085-1 that he had defiled 2930-14 Dinah 1783 his daughter: 1323 now his sons 1121 were with his cattle 4735 in the field: 7704 and Jacob 3290 held his peace 2790-52 until they were come. 935-2
34:6 And Hamor 2544 the father 1 of Shechem 7928 went out 3318-4 unto Jacob 3290 to commune 1696-15 with him. 854
34:7 And the sons 1121 of Jacob 3290 came 935-1 out of the field 7704 when they heard 8085-2 [it]: and the men 582 were grieved, 6087-101 and they were very 3966 wroth, 2734-4 because he had wrought 6213-1 folly 5039 in Israel 3478 in lying 7901-2 with Jacob's 3290 daughter; 1323 which thing ought not to be done. 6213-11
34:8 And Hamor 2544 communed 1696-17 with them, saying, 559-2 The soul 5315 of my son 1121 Shechem 7928 longeth 2836-1 for your daughter: 1323 I pray you give 5414-3 her him to wife. 802
34:9 And make ye marriages 2859-100 with us, [and] give 5414-4 your daughters 1323 unto us, and take 3947-4 our daughters 1323 unto you.
34:10 And ye shall dwell 3427-4 with us: and the land 776 shall be 1961-4 before 6440 you; dwell 3427-3 and trade 5503-1 ye therein, and get you possessions 270-10 therein.
34:11 And Shechem 7928 said 559-4 unto her father 1 and unto her brethren, 251 Let me find 4672-4 grace 2580 in your eyes, 5869 and what ye shall say 559-4 unto me I will give. 5414-4
34:12 Ask 7235-54 me never so much 3966 dowry 4119 and gift, 4976 and I will give 5414-4 according as ye shall say 559-4 unto me: but give 5414-3 me the damsel 5291 to wife. 802
34:13 And the sons 1121 of Jacob 3290 answered 6030-4 Shechem 7928 and Hamor 2544 his father 1 deceitfully, 4820 and said, 1696-17 because he had defiled 2930-14 Dinah 1783 their sister: 269
34:14 And they said 559-4 unto them, We cannot 3808 3201-4 do 6213-2 this thing, 1697 to give 5414-2 our sister 269 to one 376 that is uncircumcised; 6190 for that [were] a reproach 2781 unto us:
34:15 But in this 2063 will we consent 225-11 unto you: If ye will be as we [be], that every male 2145 of you be circumcised; 4135-9
34:16 Then will we give 5414-1 our daughters 1323 unto you, and we will take 3947-4 your daughters 1323 to us, and we will dwell 3427-1 with you, and we will become one 259 people. 5971
34:17 But if ye will not hearken 8085-4 unto us, to be circumcised; 4135-9 then will we take 3947-1 our daughter, 1323 and we will be gone. 1980-1
34:18 And their words 1697 pleased 3190-4 5869 Hamor, 2544 and 5869 Shechem 7928 Hamor's 2544 son. 1121
34:19 And the young man 5288 deferred 309-14 not to do 6213-2 the thing, 1697 because he had delight 2654-1 in Jacob's 3290 daughter: 1323 and he [was] more honourable 3513-12 than all the house 1004 of his father. 1
34:20 And Hamor 2544 and Shechem 7928 his son 1121 came 935-4 unto the gate 8179 of their city, 5892 and communed 1696-17 with the men 582 of their city, 5892 saying, 559-2
34:21 These men 582 [are] peaceable 8003 with us; 854 therefore let them dwell 3427-4 in the land, 776 and trade 5503-4 therein; for the land, 776 behold, [it is] large 7342 enough 3027 for them; 6440 let us take 3947-4 their daughters 1323 to us for wives, 802 and let us give 5414-4 them our daughters. 1323
34:22 Only herein 2063 will the men 582 consent 225-11 unto us for to dwell 3427-2 with us, to be one 259 people, 5971 if every male 2145 among us be circumcised, 4135-9 as they [are] circumcised. 4135-12
34:23 [Shall] not their cattle 4735 and their substance 7075 and every beast 929 of theirs [be] ours? only let us consent 225-11 unto them, and they will dwell 3427-4 with us.
34:24 And unto Hamor 2544 and unto Shechem 7928 his son 1121 hearkened 8085-4 all that went out 3318-6 of the gate 8179 of his city; 5892 and every male 2145 was circumcised, 4135-11 all that went out 3318-6 of the gate 8179 of his city. 5892
34:25 And it came to pass on the third 7992 day, 3117 when they were sore, 3510-6 that two 8147 of the sons 1121 of Jacob, 3290 Simeon 8095 and Levi, 3878 Dinah's 1783 brethren, 251 took 3947-4 each man 376 his sword, 2719 and came 935-4 upon the city 5892 boldly, 983 and slew 2026-4 all the males. 2145
34:26 And they slew 2026-1 Hamor 2544 and Shechem 7928 his son 1121 with the edge 6310 of the sword, 2719 and took Dinah 1783 out 3947-4 of Shechem's 7928 house, 1004 and went out. 3318-4
34:27 The sons 1121 of Jacob 3290 came 935-1 upon the slain, 2491 and spoiled 962-4 the city, 5892 because they had defiled 2930-14 their sister. 269
34:28 They took 3947-1 their sheep, 6629 and their oxen, 1241 and their asses, 2543 and that which [was] in the city, 5892 and that which [was] in the field, 7704
34:29 And all their wealth, 2428 and all their little ones, 2945 and their wives 802 took they captive, 7617-1 and spoiled 962-4 even all that [was] in the house. 1004
34:30 And Jacob 3290 said 559-4 to Simeon 8095 and Levi, 3878 Ye have troubled 5916-1 me to make me to stink 887-53 among the inhabitants 3427-6 of the land, 776 among the Canaanites 3669 and the Perizzites: 6522 and I [being] few 4962 in number, 4557 they shall gather 622-8 themselves together against me, and slay 5221-52 me; and I shall be destroyed, 8045-8 I and my house. 1004
34:31 And they said, 559-4 Should he deal 6213-4 with our sister 269 as with an harlot? 2181-6
35:1 And God 430 said 559-4 unto Jacob, 3290 Arise, 6965-3 go up 5927-3 to Bethel, 1008 and dwell 3427-3 there: and make 6213-3 there an altar 4196 unto God, 410 that appeared 7200-12 unto thee when thou fleddest 1272-2 from the face 6440 of Esau 6215 thy brother. 251
35:2 Then Jacob 3290 said 559-4 unto his household, 1004 and to all that [were] with him, Put away 5493-54 the strange 5236 gods 430 that [are] among 8432 you, and be clean, 2891-100 and change 2498-54 your garments: 8071
35:3 And let us arise, 6965-4 and go up 5927-4 to Bethel; 1008 and I will make 6213-4 there an altar 4196 unto God, 410 who answered 6030-6 me in the day 3117 of my distress, 6869 and was with me in the way 1870 which I went. 1980-1
35:4 And they gave 5414-4 unto Jacob 3290 all the strange 5236 gods 430 which [were] in their hand, 3027 and [all their] earrings 5141 which [were] in their ears; 241 and Jacob 3290 hid 2934-4 them under the oak 424 which [was] by Shechem. 7927
35:5 And they journeyed: 5265-4 and the terror 2847 of God 430 was upon the cities 5892 that [were] round about 5439 them, and they did not pursue 7291-1 after 310 the sons 1121 of Jacob. 3290
35:6 So Jacob 3290 came 935-4 to Luz, 3870 which [is] in the land 776 of Canaan, 3667 that [is], Bethel, 1008 he and all the people 5971 that [were] with him.
35:7 And he built 1129-4 there an altar, 4196 and called 7121-4 the place 4725 Elbethel: 416 because there God 430 appeared 1540-8 unto him, when he fled 1272-2 from the face 6440 of his brother. 251
35:8 But Deborah 1683 Rebekah's 7259 nurse 3243-56 died, 4191-4 and she was buried 6912-11 beneath Bethel 1008 under an oak: 437 and the name 8034 of it was called 7121-4 Allonbachuth. 439
35:9 And God 430 appeared 7200-11 unto Jacob 3290 again, when he came 935-2 out of Padanaram, 6307 and blessed 1288-17 him.
35:10 And God 430 said 559-4 unto him, Thy name 8034 [is] Jacob: 3290 thy name 8034 shall not be called 7121-11 any more Jacob, 3290 but Israel 3478 shall be thy name: 8034 and he called 7121-4 his name 8034 Israel. 3478
35:11 And God 430 said 559-4 unto him, I [am] God 410 Almighty: 7706 be fruitful 6509-3 and multiply; 7235-3 a nation 1471 and a company 6951 of nations 1471 shall be of thee, and kings 4428 shall come out 3318-4 of thy loins; 2504
35:12 And the land 776 which I gave 5414-1 Abraham 85 and Isaac, 3327 to thee I will give 5414-4 it, and to thy seed 2233 after 310 thee will I give 5414-4 the land. 776
35:13 And God 430 went up 5927-4 from him in the place 4725 where he talked 1696-14 with him.
35:14 And Jacob 3290 set up 5324-55 a pillar 4676 in the place 4725 where he talked 1696-14 with him, [even] a pillar 4678 of stone: 68 and he poured 5258-55 a drink offering 5262 thereon, and he poured 3332-4 oil 8081 thereon.
35:15 And Jacob 3290 called 7121-4 the name 8034 of the place 4725 where God 430 spake 1696-14 with him, Bethel. 1008
35:16 And they journeyed 5265-4 from Bethel; 1008 and there was but 5750 a little 3530 way 776 to come 935-2 to Ephrath: 672 and Rachel 7354 travailed, 3205-4 and she had hard 7185-17 labour. 3205-2
35:17 And it came to pass, when she was in hard 7185-53 labour, 3205-2 that the midwife 3205-18 said 559-4 unto her, Fear 3372-4 not; thou shalt have this son 1121 also.
35:18 And it came to pass, as her soul 5315 was in departing, 3318-2 (for she died) 4191-1 that she called 7121-4 his name 8034 Benoni: 1126 but his father 1 called 7121-1 him Benjamin. 1144
35:19 And Rachel 7354 died, 4191-4 and was buried 6912-11 in the way 1870 to Ephrath, 672 which [is] Bethlehem. 1035
35:20 And Jacob 3290 set 5324-55 a pillar 4676 upon her grave: 6900 that [is] the pillar 4678 of Rachel's 7354 grave 6900 unto this day. 3117
35:21 And Israel 3478 journeyed, 5265-4 and spread 5186-4 his tent 168 beyond 1973 the tower 4026 of Edar. 4029
35:22 And it came to pass, when Israel 3478 dwelt 7931-2 in that land, 776 that Reuben 7205 went 3212-4 and lay 7901-4 with Bilhah 1090 his father's 1 concubine: 6370 and Israel 3478 heard 8085-4 [it]. Now the sons 1121 of Jacob 3290 were twelve: 8147 6240
35:23 The sons 1121 of Leah; 3812 Reuben, 7205 Jacob's 3290 firstborn, 1060 and Simeon, 8095 and Levi, 3878 and Judah, 3063 and Issachar, 3485 and Zebulun: 2074
35:24 The sons 1121 of Rachel; 7354 Joseph, 3130 and Benjamin: 1144
35:25 And the sons 1121 of Bilhah, 1090 Rachel's 7354 handmaid; 8198 Dan, 1835 and Naphtali: 5321
35:26 And the sons 1121 of Zilpah, 2153 Leah's 3812 handmaid; 8198 Gad, 1410 and Asher: 836 these [are] the sons 1121 of Jacob, 3290 which were born 3205-27 to him in Padanaram. 6307
35:27 And Jacob 3290 came 935-4 unto Isaac 3327 his father 1 unto Mamre, 4471 unto the city of Arbah, 7153 which [is] Hebron, 2275 where Abraham 85 and Isaac 3327 sojourned. 1481-1
35:28 And the days 3117 of Isaac 3327 were an hundred 3967 8141 and fourscore 8084 years. 8141
35:29 And Isaac 3327 gave up the ghost, 1478-4 and died, 4191-4 and was gathered 622-11 unto his people, 5971 [being] old 2205 and full 7649 of days: 3117 and his sons 1121 Esau 6215 and Jacob 3290 buried 6912-4 him.
36:1 Now these [are] the generations 8435 of Esau, 6215 who [is] Edom. 123
36:2 Esau 6215 took 3947-1 his wives 802 of the daughters 1323 of Canaan; 3667 Adah 5711 the daughter 1323 of Elon 356 the Hittite, 2850 and Aholibamah 173 the daughter 1323 of Anah 6034 the daughter 1323 of Zibeon 6649 the Hivite; 2340
36:3 And Bashemath 1315 Ishmael's 3458 daughter, 1323 sister 269 of Nebajoth. 5032
36:4 And Adah 5711 bare 3205-4 to Esau 6215 Eliphaz; 464 and Bashemath 1315 bare 3205-1 Reuel; 7467
36:5 And Aholibamah 173 bare 3205-1 Jeush, 3274 and Jaalam, 3281 and Korah: 7141 these [are] the sons 1121 of Esau, 6215 which were born 3205-27 unto him in the land 776 of Canaan. 3667
36:6 And Esau 6215 took 3947-4 his wives, 802 and his sons, 1121 and his daughters, 1323 and all the persons 5315 of his house, 1004 and his cattle, 4735 and all his beasts, 929 and all his substance, 7075 which he had got 7408-1 in the land 776 of Canaan; 3667 and went 3212-4 into the country 776 from the face 6440 of his brother 251 Jacob. 3290
36:7 For their riches 7399 were more 7227 than that they might dwell 3427-2 together; 3162 and the land 776 wherein they were strangers 4033 could 3201-1 not bear 5375-2 them because 6440 of their cattle. 4735
36:8 Thus dwelt 3427-4 Esau 6215 in mount 2022 Seir: 8165 Esau 6215 [is] Edom. 123
36:9 And these [are] the generations 8435 of Esau 6215 the father 1 of the Edomites 123 in mount 2022 Seir: 8165
36:10 These [are] the names 8034 of Esau's 6215 sons; 1121 Eliphaz 464 the son 1121 of Adah 5711 the wife 802 of Esau, 6215 Reuel 7467 the son 1121 of Bashemath 1315 the wife 802 of Esau. 6215
36:11 And the sons 1121 of Eliphaz 464 were Teman, 8487 Omar, 201 Zepho, 6825 and Gatam, 1609 and Kenaz. 7073
36:12 And Timna 8555 was concubine 6370 to Eliphaz 464 Esau's 6215 son; 1121 and she bare 3205-4 to Eliphaz 464 Amalek: 6002 these [were] the sons 1121 of Adah 5711 Esau's 6215 wife. 802
36:13 And these [are] the sons 1121 of Reuel; 7467 Nahath, 5184 and Zerah, 2226 Shammah, 8048 and Mizzah: 4199 these were the sons 1121 of Bashemath 1315 Esau's 6215 wife. 802
36:14 And these were the sons 1121 of Aholibamah, 173 the daughter 1323 of Anah 6034 the daughter 1323 of Zibeon, 6649 Esau's 6215 wife: 802 and she bare 3205-4 to Esau 6215 Jeush, 3274 and Jaalam, 3281 and Korah. 7141
36:15 These [were] dukes 441 of the sons 1121 of Esau: 6215 the sons 1121 of Eliphaz 464 the firstborn 1060 [son] of Esau; 6215 duke 441 Teman, 8487 duke 441 Omar, 201 duke 441 Zepho, 6825 duke 441 Kenaz, 7073
36:16 Duke 441 Korah, 7141 duke 441 Gatam, 1609 [and] duke 441 Amalek: 6002 these [are] the dukes 441 [that came] of Eliphaz 464 in the land 776 of Edom; 123 these [were] the sons 1121 of Adah. 5711

36:22 And the children 1121 of Lotan 3877 were Hori 2753 and Hemam; 1967 and Lotan's 3877 sister 269 [was] Timna. 8555

36:31 And these [are] the kings 4428 that reigned 4427-1 in the land 776 of Edom, 123 before 6440 there reigned 4427-2 any king 4428 over the children 1121 of Israel. 3478
36:32 And Bela 1106 the son 1121 of Beor 1160 reigned 4427-4 in Edom: 123 and the name 8034 of his city 5892 [was] Dinhabah. 1838

36:40 And these [are] the names 8034 of the dukes 441 [that came] of Esau, 6215 according to their families, 4940 after their places, 4725 by their names; 8034 duke 441 Timnah, 8555 duke 441 Alvah, 5933 duke 441 Jetheth, 3509
36:41 Duke 441 Aholibamah, 173 duke 441 Elah, 425 duke 441 Pinon, 6373
36:42 Duke 441 Kenaz, 7073 duke 441 Teman, 8487 duke 441 Mibzar, 4014
36:43 Duke 441 Magdiel, 4025 duke 441 Iram: 5902 these [be] the dukes 441 of Edom, 123 according to their habitations 4186 in the land 776 of their possession: 272 he [is] Esau 6215 the father 1 of the Edomites. 123
37:1 And Jacob 3290 dwelt 3427-4 in the land 776 wherein his father 1 was a stranger, 4033 in the land 776 of Canaan. 3667
37:2 These [are] the generations 8435 of Jacob. 3290 Joseph, 3130 [being] seventeen 6240 7651 years 8141 old, 1121 was feeding 7462-6 the flock 6629 with his brethren; 251 and the lad 5288 [was] with the sons 1121 of Bilhah, 1090 and with the sons 1121 of Zilpah, 2153 his father's 1 wives: 802 and Joseph 3130 brought 935-55 unto his father 1 their evil 7451 report. 1681
37:3 Now Israel 3478 loved 157-1 Joseph 3130 more than all his children, 1121 because he [was] the son 1121 of his old age: 2208 and he made 6213-1 him a coat 3801 of [many] colours. 6446
37:4 And when his brethren 251 saw 7200-4 that their father 1 loved 157-1 him more than all his brethren, 251 they hated 8130-4 him, and could 3201-1 not speak 1696-15 peaceably 7965 unto him.
37:5 And Joseph 3130 dreamed 2492-4 a dream, 2472 and he told 5046-55 [it] his brethren: 251 and they hated 8130-2 him yet the more. 3254-55
37:6 And he said 559-4 unto them, Hear, 8085-3 I pray you, this dream 2472 which I have dreamed: 2492-1
37:7 For, behold, we [were] binding 481-18 sheaves 485 in 8432 the field, 7704 and, lo, my sheaf 485 arose, 6965-1 and also stood upright; 5324-8 and, behold, your sheaves 485 stood round about, 5437-4 and made obeisance 7812-101 to my sheaf. 485
37:8 And his brethren 251 said 559-4 to him, Shalt thou indeed 4427-2 reign 4427-4 over us? or shalt thou indeed 4910-2 have dominion 4910-4 over us? And they hated 8130-2 him yet the more 3254-55 for his dreams, 2472 and for his words. 1697
37:9 And he dreamed 2492-4 yet another 312 dream, 2472 and told 5608-17 it his brethren, 251 and said, 559-4 Behold, I have dreamed 2492-1 a dream 2472 more; and, behold, the sun 8121 and the moon 3394 and the eleven 6240 259 stars 3556 made obeisance 7812-102 to me.
37:10 And he told 5608-17 [it] to his father, 1 and to his brethren: 251 and his father 1 rebuked 1605-4 him, and said 559-4 unto him, What [is] this dream 2472 that thou hast dreamed? 2492-1 Shall I and thy mother 517 and thy brethren 251 indeed 935-2 come 935-4 to bow down 7812-99 ourselves to thee to the earth? 776
37:11 And his brethren 251 envied 7065-17 him; but his father 1 observed 8104-1 the saying. 1697
37:12 And his brethren 251 went 3212-4 to feed 7462-2 their father's 1 flock 6629 in Shechem. 7927
37:13 And Israel 3478 said 559-4 unto Joseph, 3130 Do not thy brethren 251 feed 7462-6 [the flock] in Shechem? 7927 come, 3212-3 and I will send 7971-4 thee unto them. And he said 559-4 to him, Here [am I].
37:14 And he said 559-4 to him, Go, 3212-3 I pray thee, see 7200-3 whether it be well 7965 with thy brethren, 251 and well 7965 with the flocks; 6629 and bring me word 1697 again. 7725-54 So he sent 7971-4 him out of the vale 6010 of Hebron, 2275 and he came 935-4 to Shechem. 7927
37:15 And a certain man 376 found 4672-4 him, and, behold, [he was] wandering 8582-6 in the field: 7704 and the man 376 asked 7592-4 him, saying, 559-2 What seekest 1245-17 thou?
37:16 And he said, 559-4 I seek 1245-18 my brethren: 251 tell 5046-54 me, I pray thee, where 375 they feed 7462-6 [their flocks].
37:17 And the man 376 said, 559-4 They are departed 5265-1 hence; 2088 for I heard 8085-1 them say, 559-6 Let us go 3212-4 to Dothan. 1886 And Joseph 3130 went 3212-4 after 310 his brethren, 251 and found 4672-4 them in Dothan. 1886
37:18 And when they saw 7200-4 him afar off, 7350 even before he came near 7126-4 unto them, they conspired 5230-101 against him to slay 4191-53 him.
37:19 And they said 559-4 one 376 to another, 251 Behold, this 1976 dreamer 1167 2472 cometh. 935-6
37:20 Come 3212-3 now therefore, and let us slay 2026-4 him, and cast 7993-55 him into some 259 pit, 953 and we will say, 559-1 Some evil 7451 beast 2416 hath devoured 398-1 him: and we shall see 7200-4 what will become of his dreams. 2472
37:21 And Reuben 7205 heard 8085-4 [it], and he delivered 5337-55 him out of their hands; 3027 and said, 559-4 Let us not kill 5221-55 him. 5315
37:22 And Reuben 7205 said 559-4 unto them, Shed 8210-4 no blood, 1818 [but] cast 7993-54 him into this pit 953 that [is] in the wilderness, 4057 and lay 7971-4 no hand 3027 upon him; that he might rid 5337-53 him out of their hands, 3027 to deliver him to his father 1 again. 7725-53
37:23 And it came to pass, when Joseph 3130 was come 935-1 unto his brethren, 251 that they stript 6584-55 853 Joseph 3130 out of 854 his coat, 3801 [his] coat 3801 of [many] colours 6446 that [was] on him;
37:24 And they took 3947-4 him, and cast 7993-55 him into a pit: 953 and the pit 953 [was] empty, 7386 [there was] no water 4325 in it.
37:25 And they sat down 3427-4 to eat 398-2 bread: 3899 and they lifted up 5375-4 their eyes 5869 and looked, 7200-4 and, behold, a company 736-6 of Ishmeelites 3459 came 935-6 from Gilead 1568 with their camels 1581 bearing 5375-6 spicery 5219 and balm 6875 and myrrh, 3910 going 1980-6 to carry [it] down 3381-53 to Egypt. 4714
37:26 And Judah 3063 said 559-4 unto his brethren, 251 What profit 1215 [is it] if we slay 2026-4 our brother, 251 and conceal 3680-14 his blood? 1818
37:27 Come, 3212-3 and let us sell 4376-4 him to the Ishmeelites, 3459 and let not our hand 3027 be upon him; for he [is] our brother 251 [and] our flesh. 1320 And his brethren 251 were content. 8085-4
37:28 Then there passed by 5674-4 Midianites 582 4084 merchantmen; 5503-6 and they drew 4900-4 and lifted up 5927-55 Joseph 3130 out of the pit, 953 and sold 4376-4 Joseph 3130 to the Ishmeelites 3459 for twenty 6242 [pieces] of silver: 3701 and they brought 935-55 Joseph 3130 into Egypt. 4714
37:29 And Reuben 7205 returned 7725-4 unto the pit; 953 and, behold, Joseph 3130 [was] not in the pit; 953 and he rent 7167-4 his clothes. 899
37:30 And he returned 7725-4 unto his brethren, 251 and said, 559-4 The child 3206 [is] not; and I, whither 575 shall I go? 935-6
37:31 And they took 3947-4 Joseph's 3130 coat, 3801 and killed 7819-4 a kid 8163 of the goats, 5795 and dipped 2881-4 the coat 3801 in the blood; 1818
37:32 And they sent 7971-17 the coat 3801 of [many] colours, 6446 and they brought 935-55 [it] to their father; 1 and said, 559-4 This have we found: 4672-1 know 5234-54 now whether it [be] thy son's 1121 coat 3801 or no.
37:33 And he knew 5234-55 it, and said, 559-4 [It is] my son's 1121 coat; 3801 an evil 7451 beast 2416 hath devoured 398-1 him; Joseph 3130 is without doubt 2963-2 rent in pieces. 2963-19
37:34 And Jacob 3290 rent 7167-4 his clothes, 8071 and put 7760-4 sackcloth 8242 upon his loins, 4975 and mourned 56-101 for his son 1121 many 7227 days. 3117
37:35 And all his sons 1121 and all his daughters 1323 rose up 6965-4 to comfort 5162-15 him; but he refused 3985-17 to be comforted; 5162-99 and he said, 559-4 For I will go down 3381-4 into the grave 7585 unto my son 1121 mourning. 57 Thus his father 1 wept 1058-4 for him.
37:36 And the Midianites 4092 sold 4376-1 him into Egypt 4714 unto Potiphar, 6318 an officer 5631 of Pharaoh's, 6547 [and] captain 8269 of the guard. 2876
38:1 And it came to pass at that time, 6256 that Judah 3063 went down 3381-4 from his brethren, 251 and turned 5186-4 in to a certain 376 Adullamite, 5726 whose name 8034 [was] Hirah. 2437
38:2 And Judah 3063 saw 7200-4 there a daughter 1323 of a certain 376 Canaanite, 3669 whose name 8034 [was] Shuah; 7770 and he took 3947-4 her, and went in 935-4 unto her.
38:3 And she conceived, 2029-4 and bare 3205-4 a son; 1121 and he called 7121-4 his name 8034 Er. 6147
38:4 And she conceived 2029-4 again, and bare 3205-4 a son; 1121 and she called 7121-4 his name 8034 Onan. 209
38:5 And she yet again conceived, 3254-55 and bare 3205-4 a son; 1121 and called 7121-4 his name 8034 Shelah: 7956 and he was at Chezib, 3580 when she bare 3205-2 him.
38:6 And Judah 3063 took 3947-4 a wife 802 for Er 6147 his firstborn, 1060 whose name 8034 [was] Tamar. 8559
38:7 And Er, 6147 Judah's 3063 firstborn, 1060 was wicked 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD; 3068 and the LORD 3068 slew 4191-55 him.
38:8 And Judah 3063 said 559-4 unto Onan, 209 Go in 935-3 unto thy brother's 251 wife, 802 and marry 2992-16 her, and raise up 6965-54 seed 2233 to thy brother. 251
38:9 And Onan 209 knew 3045-4 that the seed 2233 should not be his; and it came to pass, when 518 he went in 935-6 unto his brother's 251 wife, 802 that he spilled 7843-14 [it] on the ground, 776 lest 1115 that he should give 5414-2 seed 2233 to his brother. 251
38:10 And the thing which 834 he did 6213-1 displeased 3415-4 5869 the LORD: 3068 wherefore he slew 4191-55 him also.
38:11 Then said 559-4 Judah 3063 to Tamar 8559 his daughter in law, 3618 Remain 3427-3 a widow 490 at thy father's 1 house, 1004 till Shelah 7956 my son 1121 be grown: 1431-4 for he said, 559-1 Lest peradventure he die 4191-4 also, as his brethren 251 [did]. And Tamar 8559 went 3212-4 and dwelt 3427-4 in her father's 1 house. 1004
38:12 And in process 7235-4 of time 3117 the daughter of Shuah 1323|7770|1340 Judah's 3063 wife 802 died; 4191-4 and Judah 3063 was comforted, 5162-11 and went up 5927-4 unto his sheepshearers 1494-6 6629 to Timnath, 8553 he and his friend 7453 Hirah 2437 the Adullamite. 5726
38:13 And it was told 5046-93 Tamar, 8559 saying, 559-2 Behold thy father in law 2524 goeth up 5927-6 to Timnath 8553 to shear 1494-2 his sheep. 6629
38:14 And she put her widow's 491 garments 899 off 5493-55 from her, and covered 3680-17 her with a vail, 6809 and wrapped 5968-101 herself, and sat 3427-4 in an open 5869 place, 6607 which [is] by the way 1870 to Timnath; 8553 for she saw 7200-1 that Shelah 7956 was grown, 1431-1 and she was not given 5414-8 unto him to wife. 802
38:15 When Judah 3063 saw 7200-4 her, he thought 2803-4 her [to be] an harlot; 2181-6 because she had covered 3680-14 her face. 6440
38:16 And he turned 5186-4 unto her by the way, 1870 and said, 559-4 Go to, 3051-3 I pray thee, let me come in 935-4 unto thee; (for he knew 3045-1 not that she [was] his daughter in law.) 3618 And she said, 559-4 What wilt thou give 5414-4 me, that thou mayest come in 935-4 unto me?
38:17 And he said, 559-4 I will send 7971-17 [thee] a kid 5795 1423 from the flock. 6629 And she said, 559-4 Wilt thou give 5414-4 [me] a pledge, 6162 till thou send 7971-2 [it]?
38:18 And he said, 559-4 What 834 pledge 6162 shall I give 5414-4 thee? And she said, 559-4 Thy signet, 2368 and thy bracelets, 6616 and thy staff 4294 that [is] in thine hand. 3027 And he gave 5414-4 [it] her, and came in 935-4 unto her, and she conceived 2029-4 by him.
38:19 And she arose, 6965-4 and went away, 3212-4 and laid by 5493-55 her vail 6809 from her, and put on 3847-4 the garments 899 of her widowhood. 491
38:20 And Judah 3063 sent 7971-4 the kid 1423 5795 by the hand 3027 of his friend 7453 the Adullamite, 5726 to receive 3947-2 [his] pledge 6162 from the woman's 802 hand: 3027 but he found 4672-1 her not.
38:21 Then he asked 7592-4 the men 582 of that place, 4725 saying, 559-2 Where [is] the harlot, 6948 that [was] openly 5869 by the way side? 1870 And they said, 559-4 There was no harlot 6948 in this 2088 [place].
38:22 And he returned 7725-4 to Judah, 3063 and said, 559-4 I cannot 3808 find 4672-1 her; and also the men 582 of the place 4725 said, 559-1 [that] there was no harlot 6948 in this [place].
38:23 And Judah 3063 said, 559-4 Let her take 3947-4 [it] to her, lest we be shamed: 937 behold, I sent 7971-1 this kid, 1423 and thou hast not found 4672-1 her.
38:24 And it came to pass about three 7969 months 2320 after, that it was told 5046-93 Judah, 3063 saying, 559-2 Tamar 8559 thy daughter in law 3618 hath played the harlot; 2181-1 and also, behold, she [is] with child 2030 by whoredom. 2183 And Judah 3063 said, 559-4 Bring her forth, 3318-54 and let her be burnt. 8313-11
38:25 When she [was] brought forth, 3318-94 she sent 7971-1 to her father in law, 2524 saying, 559-2 By the man, 376 whose these [are, am] I with child: 2030 and she said, 559-4 Discern, 5234-54 I pray thee, whose [are] these, the signet, 2858 and bracelets, 6616 and staff. 4294
38:26 And Judah 3063 acknowledged 5234-55 [them], and said, 559-4 She hath been more righteous 6663-1 than I; because that I gave 5414-1 her not to Shelah 7956 my son. 1121 And he knew her 3045-2 again 3254-1 no more.
38:27 And it came to pass in the time 6256 of her travail, 3205-2 that, behold, twins 8380 [were] in her womb. 990
38:28 And it came to pass, when she travailed, 3205-2 that [the one] put 5414-4 out [his] hand: 3027 and the midwife 3205-18 took 3947-4 and bound 7194-4 upon his hand 3027 a scarlet thread, 8144 saying, 559-2 This came out 3318-1 first. 7223
38:29 And it came to pass, as he drew back 7725-56 his hand, 3027 that, behold, his brother 251 came out: 3318-1 and she said, 559-4 How hast thou broken forth? 6555-1 [this] breach 6556 [be] upon thee: therefore his name 8034 was called 7121-4 Pharez. 6557
38:30 And afterward 310 came out 3318-1 his brother, 251 that had the scarlet thread 8144 upon his hand: 3027 and his name 8034 was called 7121-4 Zarah. 2226
39:1 And Joseph 3130 was brought down 3381-90 to Egypt; 4714 and Potiphar, 6318 an officer 5631 of Pharaoh, 6547 captain 8269 of the guard, 2876 an Egyptian, 376 4713 bought 7069-4 him of the hands 3027 of the Ishmeelites, 3459 which had brought him down 3381-52 thither.
39:2 And the LORD 3068 was with Joseph, 3130 and he was a prosperous 6743-56 man; 376 and he was in the house 1004 of his master 113 the Egyptian. 4713
39:3 And his master 113 saw 7200-4 that the LORD 3068 [was] with him, and that the LORD 3068 made all that he did 6213-6 to prosper 6743-56 in his hand. 3027
39:4 And Joseph 3130 found 4672-4 grace 2580 in his sight, 5869 and he served 8334-17 him: and he made him overseer 6485-55 over his house, 1004 and all [that] he had 3426 he put 5414-1 into his hand. 3027
39:5 And it came to pass from the time 227 [that] he had made him overseer 6485-52 in his house, 1004 and over all that he had, 3426 that the LORD 3068 blessed 1288-17 the Egyptian's 4713 house 1004 for Joseph's 3130 sake; 1558 and the blessing 1293 of the LORD 3068 was upon all that he had 3426 in the house, 1004 and in the field. 7704
39:6 And he left 5800-4 all that he had in Joseph's 3130 hand; 3027 and he knew 3045-1 not ought 3972 he had, save 518 the bread 3899 which he did eat. 398-6 And Joseph 3130 was [a] goodly 3303 8389 [person], and well 3303 favoured. 4758
39:7 And it came to pass after 310 these things, 1697 that his master's 113 wife 802 cast 5375-4 her eyes 5869 upon Joseph; 3130 and she said, 559-4 Lie 7901-3 with me.
39:8 But he refused, 3985-17 and said 559-4 unto his master's 113 wife, 802 Behold, my master 113 wotteth 3045-1 not what [is] with me in the house, 1004 and he hath committed 5414-1 all that he hath 3426 to my hand; 3027
39:9 [There is] none greater 1419 in this house 1004 than I; neither 3808 hath he kept back 2820-1 any thing 3972 from me but thee, because 834 thou 859 [art] his wife: 802 how then can I do 6213-4 this great 1419 wickedness, 7451 and sin 2398-1 against God? 430
39:10 And it came to pass, as she spake 1696-15 to Joseph 3130 day 3117 by day, 3117 that he hearkened 8085-1 not unto her, to lie 7901-2 by her, 681 [or] to be with her.
39:11 And it came to pass about this time, 3117 that [Joseph] went 935-4 into the house 1004 to do 6213-2 his business; 4399 and [there was] none of the men 376 582 of the house 1004 there within. 1004
39:12 And she caught 8610-4 him by his garment, 899 saying, 559-2 Lie 7901-3 with me: and he left 5800-4 his garment 899 in her hand, 3027 and fled, 5127-4 and got him 3318-4 out. 2351
39:13 And it came to pass, when she saw 7200-2 that he had left 5800-1 his garment 899 in her hand, 3027 and was fled 5127-4 forth, 2351
39:14 That she called 7121-4 unto the men 582 of her house, 1004 and spake 559-4 unto them, saying, 559-2 See, 7200-3 he hath brought in 935-52 an Hebrew 376 5680 unto us to mock 6711-15 us; he came in 935-1 unto me to lie 7901-2 with me, and I cried 7121-4 with a loud 1419 voice: 6963
39:15 And it came to pass, when he heard 8085-2 that I lifted up 7311-52 my voice 6963 and cried, 7121-4 that he left 5800-4 his garment 899 with me, 681 and fled, 5127-4 and got him 3318-4 out. 2351
39:16 And she laid up 3240-55 his garment 899 by her, 681 until his lord 113 came 935-2 home. 1004
39:17 And she spake 1696-17 unto him according to these words, 1697 saying, 559-2 The Hebrew 5680 servant, 5650 which thou hast brought 935-52 unto us, came in 935-1 unto me to mock 6711-15 me:
39:18 And it came to pass, as I lifted up 7311-53 my voice 6963 and cried, 7121-4 that he left 5800-4 his garment 899 with me, 681 and fled 5127-4 out. 2351
39:19 And it came to pass, when his master 113 heard 8085-2 the words 1697 of his wife, 802 which she spake 1696-14 unto him, saying, 559-2 After this manner 1697 did 6213-1 thy servant 5650 to me; that his wrath 639 was kindled. 2734-4
39:20 And Joseph's 3130 master 113 took 3947-4 him, and put 5414-4 him into the prison, 1004 5470 a place 4725 where the king's 4428 prisoners 615 [were] bound: 631-7 and he was there in the prison. 1004 5470
39:21 But the LORD 3068 was with Joseph, 3130 and shewed 5186-4 him mercy, 2617 and gave 5414-4 him favour 2580 in the sight 5869 of the keeper 8269 of the prison. 1004 5470
39:22 And the keeper 8269 of the prison 1004 5470 committed 5414-4 to Joseph's 3130 hand 3027 all the prisoners 615 that [were] in the prison; 1004 5470 and whatsoever they did 6213-6 there, he was the doer 6213-6 [of it].
39:23 The keeper 8269 of the prison 1004 5470 looked 7200-6 not to any thing 3972 [that was] under his hand; 3027 because the LORD 3068 was with him, and [that] which he did, 6213-6 the LORD 3068 made [it] to prosper. 6743-56
40:1 And it came to pass after 310 these things, 1697 [that] the butler 8248-56 of the king 4428 of Egypt 4714 and [his] baker 644-6 had offended 2398-1 their lord 113 the king 4428 of Egypt. 4714
40:2 And Pharaoh 6547 was wroth 7107-4 against 5921 two 8147 [of] his officers, 5631 against the chief 8269 of the butlers, 8248-56 and against the chief 8269 of the bakers. 644-6
40:3 And he put 5414-4 them in ward 4929 in the house 1004 of the captain 8269 of the guard, 2876 into the prison, 1004 5470 the place 4725 where Joseph 3130 [was] bound. 631-7
40:4 And the captain 8269 of the guard 2876 charged 6485-4 Joseph 3130 with them, and he served 8334-17 them: and they continued a season 3117 in ward. 4929
40:5 And they dreamed 2492-4 a dream 2472 both 8147 of them, each man 376 his dream 2472 in one 259 night, 3915 each man 376 according to the interpretation 6623 of his dream, 2472 the butler 8248-56 and the baker 644-6 of the king 4428 of Egypt, 4714 which [were] bound 631-7 in the prison. 1004 5470
40:6 And Joseph 3130 came in 935-4 unto them in the morning, 1242 and looked 7200-4 upon them, and, behold, they [were] sad. 2196-6
40:7 And he asked 7592-4 Pharaoh's 6547 officers 5631 that [were] with him in the ward 4929 of his lord's 113 house, 1004 saying, 559-2 Wherefore look ye 6440 [so] sadly 7451 to day? 3117
40:8 And they said 559-4 unto him, We have dreamed 2492-1 a dream, 2472 and [there is] no interpreter 6622-6 of it. And Joseph 3130 said 559-4 unto them, [Do] not interpretations 6623 [belong] to God? 430 tell 5608-16 me [them], I pray you.
40:9 And the chief 8269 butler 8248-56 told 5608-17 his dream 2472 to Joseph, 3130 and said 559-4 to him, In my dream, 2472 behold, a vine 1612 [was] before 6440 me;
40:10 And in the vine 1612 [were] three 7969 branches: 8299 and it [was] as though it budded, 6524-6 [and] her blossoms 5322 shot forth; 5927-1 and the clusters 811 thereof brought forth ripe 1310-52 grapes: 6025
40:11 And Pharaoh's 6547 cup 3563 [was] in my hand: 3027 and I took 3947-4 the grapes, 6025 and pressed 7818-4 them into Pharaoh's 6547 cup, 3563 and I gave 5414-4 the cup 3563 into Pharaoh's 6547 hand. 3709
40:12 And Joseph 3130 said 559-4 unto him, This [is] the interpretation 6623 of it: The three 7969 branches 8299 [are] three 7969 days: 3117
40:13 Yet 5750 within three 7969 days 3117 shall Pharaoh 6547 lift up 5375-4 thine head, 7218 and restore 7725-52 thee unto thy place: 3653 and thou shalt deliver 5414-1 Pharaoh's 6547 cup 3563 into his hand, 3027 after the former 7223 manner 4941 when thou wast his butler. 8248-56
40:14 But think 2142-1 on me when it shall be well 3190-4 with thee, and shew 6213-1 kindness, 2617 I pray thee, unto me, and make mention 2142-52 of me unto Pharaoh, 6547 and bring me out 3318-52 of this house: 1004
40:15 For indeed 1589-28 I was stolen away 1589-27 out of the land 776 of the Hebrews: 5680 and here also have I done 6213-1 nothing 3808 3972 that they should put 7760-1 me into the dungeon. 953
40:16 When the chief 8269 baker 644-6 saw 7200-4 that the interpretation 6622-1 was good, 2896 he said 559-4 unto Joseph, 3130 I also 637 [was] in my dream, 2472 and, behold, [I had] three 7969 white 2751 baskets 5536 on my head: 7218
40:17 And in the uppermost 5945 basket 5536 [there was] of all manner of bakemeats 3978 4639 644-6 for Pharaoh; 6547 and the birds 5775 did eat 398-6 them out of the basket 5536 upon 5921 my head. 7218
40:18 And Joseph 3130 answered 6030-4 and said, 559-4 This [is] the interpretation 6623 thereof: The three 7969 baskets 5536 [are] three 7969 days: 3117
40:19 Yet within three 7969 days 3117 shall Pharaoh 6547 lift up 5375-4 thy head 7218 from off thee, and shall hang 8518-1 thee on a tree; 6086 and the birds 5775 shall eat 398-1 thy flesh 1320 from off thee.
40:20 And it came to pass the third 7992 day, 3117 [which was] Pharaoh's 6547 birthday, 3117 3205-91 that he made 6213-4 a feast 4960 unto all his servants: 5650 and he lifted up 5375-4 the head 7218 of the chief 8269 butler 8248-56 and of 7218 the chief 8269 baker 644-6 among 8432 his servants. 5650
40:21 And he restored 7725-55 the chief 8269 butler 8248-56 unto his butlership 4945 again; and he gave 5414-4 the cup 3563 into Pharaoh's 6547 hand: 3709
40:22 But he hanged 8518-1 the chief 8269 baker: 644-6 as Joseph 3130 had interpreted 6622-1 to them.
40:23 Yet did not the chief 8269 butler 8248-56 remember 2142-1 Joseph, 3130 but forgat 7911-4 him.
41:1 And it came to pass at the end 7093 of two full 3117 years, 8141 that Pharaoh 6547 dreamed: 2492-6 and, behold, he stood 5975-6 by the river. 2975
41:2 And, behold, there came up 5927-6 out of the river 2975 seven 7651 well 3303 favoured 4758 kine 6510 and fatfleshed; 1277 1320 and they fed 7462-4 in a meadow. 260
41:3 And, behold, seven 7651 other 312 kine 6510 came up 5927-6 after 310 them out of the river, 2975 ill 7451 favoured 4758 and leanfleshed; 1851 1320 and stood 5975-4 by 681 the [other] kine 6510 upon the brink 8193 of the river. 2975
41:4 And the ill 7451 favoured 4758 and leanfleshed 1851 1320 kine 6510 did eat 398-4 up the seven 7651 well 3303 favoured 4758 and fat 1277 kine. 6510 So Pharaoh 6547 awoke. 3364-4
41:5 And he slept 3462-4 and dreamed 2492-4 the second time: 8145 and, behold, seven 7651 ears of corn 7641 came up 5927-6 upon one 259 stalk, 7070 rank 1277 and good. 2896
41:6 And, behold, seven 7651 thin 1851 ears 7641 and blasted 7710-7 with the east wind 6921 sprung up 6779-6 after 310 them.
41:7 And the seven thin 1851 ears 7641 devoured 1104-4 the seven 7651 rank 1277 and full 4392 ears. 7641 And Pharaoh 6547 awoke, 3364-4 and, behold, [it was] a dream. 2472
41:8 And it came to pass in the morning 1242 that his spirit 7307 was troubled; 6470-11 and he sent 7971-4 and called 7121-4 for all the magicians 2748 of Egypt, 4714 and all the wise men 2450 thereof: and Pharaoh 6547 told 5608-17 them his dream; 2472 but [there was] none that could interpret 6622-6 them unto Pharaoh. 6547
41:9 Then spake 1696-17 the chief 8269 butler 8248-56 unto Pharaoh, 6547 saying, 559-2 I do remember 2142-56 my faults 2399 this day: 3117
41:10 Pharaoh 6547 was wroth 7107-1 with his servants, 5650 and put 5414-4 me in ward 4929 in the captain 8269 of the guard's 2876 house, 1004 [both] me and the chief 8269 baker: 644-6
41:11 And we dreamed 2492-4 a dream 2472 in one 259 night, 3915 I and he; we dreamed 2492-1 each man 376 according to the interpretation 6623 of his dream. 2472
41:12 And [there was] there with us a young man, 5288 an Hebrew, 5680 servant 5650 to the captain 8269 of the guard; 2876 and we told 5608-17 him, and he interpreted 6622-4 to us our dreams; 2472 to each man 376 according to his dream 2472 he did interpret. 6622-1
41:13 And it came to pass, as he interpreted 6622-1 to us, so it was; me he restored 7725-52 unto mine office, 3653 and him he hanged. 8518-1
41:14 Then Pharaoh 6547 sent 7971-4 and called 7121-4 Joseph, 3130 and they brought him hastily 7323-55 out of the dungeon: 953 and he shaved 1548-17 [himself], and changed 2498-17 his raiment, 8071 and came 935-4 in unto Pharaoh. 6547
41:15 And Pharaoh 6547 said 559-4 unto Joseph, 3130 I have dreamed 2492-1 a dream, 2472 and [there is] none that can interpret 6622-6 it: and I have heard 8085-1 say 559-2 of thee, [that] thou canst understand 8085-4 a dream 2472 to interpret 6622-2 it.
41:16 And Joseph 3130 answered 6030-4 Pharaoh, 6547 saying, 559-2 [It is] not in me: 1107 God 430 shall give Pharaoh 6547 an answer 6030-4 of peace. 7965
41:17 And Pharaoh 6547 said 1696-17 unto Joseph, 3130 In my dream, 2472 behold, I stood 5975-6 upon the bank 8193 of the river: 2975
41:18 And, behold, there came up 5927-6 out of the river 2975 seven 7651 kine, 6510 fatfleshed 1277 1320 and well 3303 favoured; 8389 and they fed 7462-4 in a meadow: 260
41:19 And, behold, seven 7651 other 312 kine 6510 came up 5927-6 after 310 them, poor 1803 and very 3966 ill 7451 favoured 8389 and leanfleshed, 7534 1320 such 2007 as I never 3808 saw 7200-1 in all the land 776 of Egypt 4714 for badness: 7455
41:20 And the lean 7534 and the ill favoured 7451 kine 6510 did eat 398-4 up the first 7223 seven 7651 fat 1277 kine: 6510
41:21 And when they had eaten 935-4 7130 them up, it could not be known 3045-8 that they had eaten 935-1 7130 them; but they [were] still ill 7451 favoured, 4758 as at the beginning. 8462 So I awoke. 3364-4
41:22 And I saw 7200-4 in my dream, 2472 and, behold, seven 7651 ears 7641 came up 5927-6 in one 259 stalk, 7070 full 4392 and good: 2896
41:23 And, behold, seven 7651 ears, 7641 withered, 6798-7 thin, 1851 [and] blasted 7710-7 with the east wind, 6921 sprung up 6779-6 after 310 them:
41:24 And the thin 1851 ears 7641 devoured 1104-4 the seven 7651 good 2896 ears: 7641 and I told 559-4 [this] unto the magicians; 2748 but [there was] none that could declare 5046-56 [it] to me.
41:25 And Joseph 3130 said 559-4 unto Pharaoh, 6547 The dream 2472 of Pharaoh 6547 [is] one: 259 God 430 hath shewed 5046-52 Pharaoh 6547 what he [is] about to do. 6213-6
41:26 The seven 7651 good 2896 kine 6510 [are] seven 7651 years; 8141 and the seven 7651 good 2896 ears 7641 [are] seven 7651 years: 8141 the dream 2472 [is] one. 259
41:27 And the seven 7651 thin 7534 and ill favoured 7451 kine 6510 that came up 5927-6 after 310 them [are] seven 7651 years; 8141 and the seven 7651 empty 7386 ears 7641 blasted 7710-7 with the east wind 6921 shall be seven 7651 years 8141 of famine. 7458
41:28 This [is] the thing 1697 which I have spoken 1696-14 unto Pharaoh: 6547 What God 430 [is] about to do 6213-6 he sheweth 7200-52 unto Pharaoh. 6547
41:29 Behold, there come 935-6 seven 7651 years 8141 of great 1419 plenty 7647 throughout all the land 776 of Egypt: 4714
41:30 And there shall arise 6965-1 after 310 them seven 7651 years 8141 of famine; 7458 and all the plenty 7647 shall be forgotten 7911-8 in the land 776 of Egypt; 4714 and the famine 7458 shall consume 3615-14 the land; 776
41:31 And the plenty 7647 shall not be known 3045-11 in the land 776 by reason 6440 of that famine 7458 following; 310 3651 for it [shall be] very 3966 grievous. 3515
41:32 And for that the dream 2472 was doubled 8138-9 unto Pharaoh 6547 twice; 6471 [it is] because the thing 1697 [is] established 3559-12 by 5973 God, 430 and God 430 will shortly 4116-18 bring it to pass. 6213-2
41:33 Now therefore let Pharaoh 6547 look out 7200-4 a man 376 discreet 995-12 and wise, 2450 and set 7896-4 him over the land 776 of Egypt. 4714
41:34 Let Pharaoh 6547 do 6213-4 [this], and let him appoint 6485-55 officers 6496 over the land, 776 and take up the fifth part 2567-14 of the land 776 of Egypt 4714 in the seven 7651 plenteous 7647 years. 8141
41:35 And let them gather 6908-4 all the food 400 of those good 2896 years 8141 that come, 935-6 and lay up 6651-4 corn 1250 under the hand 3027 of Pharaoh, 6547 and let them keep 8104-1 food 400 in the cities. 5892
41:36 And that food 400 shall be for store 6487 to the land 776 against the seven 7651 years 8141 of famine, 7458 which shall be in the land 776 of Egypt; 4714 that the land 776 perish 3772-11 not through the famine. 7458
41:37 And the thing 1697 was good 3190-4 in the eyes 5869 of Pharaoh, 6547 and in the eyes 5869 of all his servants. 5650
41:38 And Pharaoh 6547 said 559-4 unto his servants, 5650 Can we find 4672-4 [such a one] as this 2088 [is], a man 376 in whom 834 the Spirit 7307 of God 430 [is]?
41:39 And Pharaoh 6547 said 559-4 unto Joseph, 3130 Forasmuch 310 as God 430 hath shewed 3045-53 thee all this, [there is] none so discreet 995-12 and wise 2450 as thou [art]:
41:40 Thou shalt be 1961-4 over my house, 1004 and according unto thy word 6310 shall all my people 5971 be ruled: 5401-4 only in the throne 3678 will I be greater 1431-4 than thou.
41:41 And Pharaoh 6547 said 559-4 unto Joseph, 3130 See, 7200-3 I have set 5414-1 thee over all the land 776 of Egypt. 4714
41:42 And Pharaoh 6547 took off 5493-55 his ring 2885 from his hand, 3027 and put 5414-4 it upon Joseph's 3130 hand, 3027 and arrayed 3847-55 him in vestures 899 of fine linen, 8336 and put 7760-4 a gold 2091 chain 7242 about his neck; 6677
41:43 And he made him to ride 7392-55 in the second 4932 chariot 4818 which he had; and they cried 7121-4 before 6440 him, Bow the knee: 86 and he made 5414-2 him [ruler] over all the land 776 of Egypt. 4714
41:44 And Pharaoh 6547 said 559-4 unto Joseph, 3130 I [am] Pharaoh, 6547 and without 1107 thee shall no man 376 lift up 7311-55 his hand 3027 or foot 7272 in all the land 776 of Egypt. 4714
41:45 And Pharaoh 6547 called 7121-4 Joseph's 3130 name 8034 Zaphnathpaaneah; 6847 and he gave 5414-4 him to wife 802 Asenath 621 the daughter 1323 of Potipherah 6319 priest 3548 of On. 204 And Joseph 3130 went out 3318-4 over [all] the land 776 of Egypt. 4714
41:46 And Joseph 3130 [was] thirty 7970 years 8141 old 1121 when he stood 5975-2 before 6440 Pharaoh 6547 king 4428 of Egypt. 4714 And Joseph 3130 went out 3318-4 from the presence 6440 of Pharaoh, 6547 and went throughout 5674-4 all the land 776 of Egypt. 4714
41:47 And in the seven 7651 plenteous 7647 years 8141 the earth 776 brought forth 6213-4 by handfuls. 7062
41:48 And he gathered up 6908-4 all the food 400 of the seven 7651 years, 8141 which were in the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 and laid up 5414-4 the food 400 in the cities: 5892 the food 400 of the field, 7704 which [was] round about 5439 every city, 5892 laid he up 5414-1 in the same. 8432
41:49 And Joseph 3130 gathered 6651-4 corn 1250 as the sand 2344 of the sea, 3220 very 3966 much, 7235-53 until he left 2308-1 numbering; 5608-2 for [it was] without 369 number. 4557
41:50 And unto Joseph 3130 were born 3205-27 two 8147 sons 1121 before the years 8141 of famine 7458 came, 935-4 which Asenath 621 the daughter 1323 of Potipherah 6319 priest 3548 of On 204 bare 3205-1 unto him.
41:51 And Joseph 3130 called 7121-4 the name 8034 of the firstborn 1060 Manasseh: 4519 For God, 430 [said he], hath made me forget 5382-14 all my toil, 5999 and all my father's 1 house. 1004
41:52 And the name 8034 of the second 8145 called 7121-1 he Ephraim: 669 For God 430 hath caused me to be fruitful 6509-52 in the land 776 of my affliction. 6040
41:53 And the seven 7651 years 8141 of plenteousness, 7647 that was in the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 were ended. 3615-4
41:54 And the seven 7651 years 8141 of dearth 7458 began 2490-55 to come, 935-2 according as Joseph 3130 had said: 559-1 and the dearth 7458 was in all lands; 776 but in all the land 776 of Egypt 4714 there was bread. 3899
41:55 And when all the land 776 of Egypt 4714 was famished, 7456-4 the people 5971 cried 6817-4 to Pharaoh 6547 for bread: 3899 and Pharaoh 6547 said 559-4 unto all the Egyptians, 4714 Go 3212-3 unto Joseph; 3130 what he saith 559-4 to you, do. 6213-4
41:56 And the famine 7458 was over all the face 6440 of the earth: 776 And Joseph 3130 opened 6605-4 all the storehouses, and sold 7666-4 unto the Egyptians; 4714 and the famine 7458 waxed sore 2388-4 in the land 776 of Egypt. 4714
41:57 And all countries 776 came 935-1 into Egypt 4714 to Joseph 3130 for to buy 7666-2 [corn]; because that the famine 7458 was [so] sore 2388-1 in all lands. 776
42:1 Now when Jacob 3290 saw 7200-4 that there was 3426 corn 7668 in Egypt, 4714 Jacob 3290 said 559-4 unto his sons, 1121 Why do ye look 7200-101 one upon another?
42:2 And he said, 559-4 Behold, I have heard 8085-1 that there is 3426 corn 7668 in Egypt: 4714 get you down 3381-3 thither, and buy 7666-3 for us from thence; that we may live, 2421-4 and not die. 4191-4
42:3 And Joseph's 3130 ten 6235 brethren 251 went down 3381-4 to buy 7666-2 corn 1250 in Egypt. 4714
42:4 But Benjamin, 1144 Joseph's 3130 brother, 251 Jacob 3290 sent 7971-1 not with his brethren; 251 for he said, 559-1 Lest peradventure 6435 mischief 611 befall 7122-4 him.
42:5 And the sons 1121 of Israel 3478 came 935-4 to buy 7666-2 [corn] among 8432 those that came: 935-6 for the famine 7458 was in the land 776 of Canaan. 3667
42:6 And Joseph 3130 [was] the governor 7989 over the land, 776 [and] he [it was] that sold 7666-56 to all the people 5971 of the land: 776 and Joseph's 3130 brethren 251 came, 935-4 and bowed down 7812-101 themselves before him [with] their faces 639 to the earth. 776
42:7 And Joseph 3130 saw 7200-4 his brethren, 251 and he knew 5234-55 them, but made himself strange 5234-101 unto them, and spake 1696-17 roughly 7186 unto them; and he said 559-4 unto them, Whence 370 come 935-1 ye? And they said, 559-4 From the land 776 of Canaan 3667 to buy 7666-2 food. 400
42:8 And Joseph 3130 knew 5234-55 his brethren, 251 but they knew 5234-52 not him.
42:9 And Joseph 3130 remembered 2142-4 the dreams 2472 which he dreamed 2492-1 of them, and said 559-4 unto them, Ye 859 [are] spies; 7270-18 to see 7200-2 the nakedness 6172 of the land 776 ye are come. 935-1
42:10 And they said 559-4 unto him, Nay, my lord, 113 but to buy 7666-2 food 400 are thy servants 5650 come. 935-1
42:11 We 5168 [are] all one 259 man's 376 sons; 1121 we [are] true 3651 [men], thy servants 5650 are no spies. 7270-18
42:12 And he said 559-4 unto them, Nay, but to see 7200-2 the nakedness 6172 of the land 776 ye are come. 935-1
42:13 And they said, 559-4 Thy servants 5650 [are] twelve 8147 6240 brethren, 251 the sons 1121 of one 259 man 376 in the land 776 of Canaan; 3667 and, behold, the youngest 6996 [is] this day 3117 with our father, 1 and one 259 [is] not.
42:14 And Joseph 3130 said 559-4 unto them, That [is it] that I spake 1696-14 unto you, saying, 559-2 Ye [are] spies: 7270-18
42:15 Hereby 2063 ye shall be proved: 974-11 By the life 2416 of Pharaoh 6547 ye shall not go forth 3318-4 hence, except your youngest 6996 brother 251 come 935-2 hither.
42:16 Send 7971-3 one 259 of you, and let him fetch 3947-4 your brother, 251 and ye shall be kept 631-10 in prison, that your words 1697 may be proved, 974-11 whether [there be any] truth 571 in you: 854 or else 3808 by the life 2416 of Pharaoh 6547 surely ye [are] spies. 7270-18
42:17 And he put them all together 622-4 into ward 4929 three 7969 days. 3117
42:18 And Joseph 3130 said 559-4 unto them the third 7992 day, 3117 This do, 6213-3 and live; 2421-3 [for] I fear 3373 God: 430
42:19 If ye 859 [be] true 3651 [men], let one 259 of your brethren 251 be bound 631-11 in the house 1004 of your prison: 4929 go 3212-3 ye, carry 935-54 corn 7668 for the famine 7459 of your houses: 1004
42:20 But bring 935-55 your youngest 6996 brother 251 unto me; so shall your words 1697 be verified, 539-11 and ye shall not die. 4191-4 And they did 6213-4 so.
42:21 And they said 559-4 one 376 to another, 251 We [are] verily 61 guilty 818 concerning our brother, 251 in that 834 we saw 7200-1 the anguish 6869 of his soul, 5315 when he besought 2603-99 us, and we would not hear; 8085-1 therefore is this distress 6869 come 935-1 upon us.
42:22 And Reuben 7205 answered 6030-4 them, saying, 559-2 Spake 559-1 I not unto you, saying, 559-2 Do not sin 2398-4 against the child; 3206 and ye would not hear? 8085-1 therefore, behold, also his blood 1818 is required. 1875-8
42:23 And they knew 3045-1 not that Joseph 3130 understood 8085-6 [them]; for he spake unto them by an interpreter. 3887-56
42:24 And he turned himself about 5437-11 from them, and wept; 1058-4 and returned 7725-4 to them again, and communed 1696-17 with them, and took 3947-4 from them Simeon, 8095 and bound 631-4 him before their eyes. 5869
42:25 Then Joseph 3130 commanded 6680-17 to fill 4390-17 their sacks 3627 with corn, 1250 and to restore 7725-53 every man's 376 money 3701 into his sack, 8242 and to give 5414-2 them provision 6720 for the way: 1870 and thus 3651 did 6213-4 he unto them.
42:26 And they laded 5375-4 their asses 2543 with the corn, 7668 and departed 3212-4 thence.
42:27 And as one 259 of them opened 6605-4 his sack 8242 to give 5414-2 his ass 2543 provender 4554 in the inn, 4411 he espied 7200-4 his money; 3701 for, behold, it [was] in his sack's 572 mouth. 6310
42:28 And he said 559-4 unto his brethren, 251 My money 3701 is restored; 7725-90 and, lo, 2009 [it is] even in my sack: 572 and their heart 3820 failed 3318-4 [them], and they were afraid, 2729-4 saying 559-2 one 376 to another, 251 What [is] this [that] God 430 hath done 6213-1 unto us?
42:29 And they came 935-4 unto Jacob 3290 their father 1 unto the land 776 of Canaan, 3667 and told 5046-55 him all that befell 7136-6 unto them; saying, 559-2
42:30 The man, 376 [who is] the lord 113 of the land, 776 spake 1696-14 roughly 7186 to us, and took 5414-4 us for spies 7270-18 of the country. 776
42:31 And we said 559-4 unto him, We [are] true 3651 [men]; we are no spies: 7270-18
42:32 We [be] twelve 6240 8147 brethren, 251 sons 1121 of our father; 1 one 259 [is] not, and the youngest 6996 [is] this day 3117 with our father 1 in the land 776 of Canaan. 3667
42:33 And the man, 376 the lord 113 of the country, 776 said 559-4 unto us, Hereby shall I know 3045-4 that ye [are] true 3651 [men]; leave 3240-54 one 259 of your brethren 251 [here] with me, and take 3947-3 [food for] the famine 7459 of your households, 1004 and be gone: 3212-3
42:34 And bring 935-54 your youngest 6996 brother 251 unto me: then shall I know 3045-4 that ye [are] no spies, 7270-18 but [that] ye [are] true 3651 [men: so] will I deliver 5414-4 you your brother, 251 and ye shall traffick 5503-4 in the land. 776
42:35 And it came to pass as they emptied 7324-56 their sacks, 8242 that, behold, every man's 376 bundle 6872 of money 3701 [was] in his sack: 8242 and when [both] they and their father 1 saw 7200-4 the bundles 6872 of money, 3701 they were afraid. 3372-4
42:36 And Jacob 3290 their father 1 said 559-4 unto them, Me have ye bereaved 7921-14 [of my children]: Joseph 3130 [is] not, and Simeon 8095 [is] not, and ye will take 3947-4 Benjamin 1144 [away]: all these things are against me.
42:37 And Reuben 7205 spake 559-4 unto his father, 1 saying, 559-2 Slay 4191-55 my two 8147 sons, 1121 if I bring 935-55 him not to thee: deliver 5414-3 him into my hand, 3027 and I will bring him to thee again. 7725-55
42:38 And he said, 559-4 My son 1121 shall not go down 3381-4 with you; for his brother 251 is dead, 4191-1 and he is left 7604-8 alone: if mischief 611 befall 7122-1 him by the way 1870 in the which ye go, 3212-4 then shall ye bring down 3381-52 my gray hairs 7872 with sorrow 3015 to the grave. 7585
43:1 And the famine 7458 [was] sore 3515 in the land. 776
43:2 And it came to pass, when they had 3615-14 eaten 398-2 up the corn 7668 which they had brought 935-52 out of Egypt, 4714 their father 1 said 559-4 unto them, Go again, 7725-3 buy 7666-3 us a little 4592 food. 400
43:3 And Judah 3063 spake 559-4 unto him, saying, 559-2 The man 376 did solemnly 5749-53 protest 5749-52 unto us, saying, 559-2 Ye shall not see 7200-4 my face, 6440 except 1115 your brother 251 [be] with you.
43:4 If thou wilt 3426 send 7971-18 our brother 251 with us, we will go down 3381-4 and buy 7666-4 thee food: 400
43:5 But if thou wilt not send 7971-18 [him], we will not go down: 3381-4 for the man 376 said 559-1 unto us, Ye shall not see 7200-4 my face, 6440 except your brother 251 [be] with you.
43:6 And Israel 3478 said, 559-4 Wherefore dealt ye [so] ill 7489-52 with me, [as] to tell 5046-53 the man 376 whether ye had yet a brother? 251
43:7 And they said, 559-4 The man 376 asked 7592-1 us straitly 7592-2 of our state, and of our kindred, 4138 saying, 559-2 [Is] your father 1 yet alive? 2416 have 3426 ye [another] brother? 251 and we told 5046-55 him according 5921 to the tenor 6310 of these words: 1697 could we certainly 3045-2 know 3045-4 that he would say, 559-4 Bring your brother 251 down? 3381-54
43:8 And Judah 3063 said 559-4 unto Israel 3478 his father, 1 Send 7971-3 the lad 5288 with me, and we will arise 6965-4 and go; 3212-4 that we may live, 2421-4 and not die, 4191-4 both we, and thou, [and] also our little ones. 2945
43:9 I will be surety 6148-4 for him; of my hand 3027 shalt thou require 1245-17 him: if I bring 935-52 him not 518 unto thee, and set 3322-52 him before 6440 thee, then let me bear the blame 2398-1 for ever: 3117
43:10 For except 3884 we had lingered, 4102-115 surely now we had returned 7725-1 this second time. 6471
43:11 And their father 1 Israel 3478 said 559-4 unto them, If [it must be] so now, 645 do 6213-3 this; take 3947-3 of the best fruits 2173 in the land 776 in your vessels, 3627 and carry down 3381-54 the man 376 a present, 4503 a little 4592 balm, 6875 and a little 4592 honey, 1706 spices, 5219 and myrrh, 3910 nuts, 992 and almonds: 8247
43:12 And take 3947-3 double 4932 money 3701 in your hand; 3027 and the money 3701 that was brought again 7725-94 in the mouth 6310 of your sacks, 572 carry [it] again 7725-55 in your hand; 3027 peradventure it [was] an oversight: 4870
43:13 Take 3947-3 also your brother, 251 and arise, 6965-3 go again 7725-3 unto the man: 376
43:14 And God 410 Almighty 7706 give 5414-4 you mercy 7356 before 6440 the man, 376 that he may send away 7971-14 your other 312 brother, 251 and Benjamin. 1144 If 834 I be bereaved 7921-1 [of my children], I am bereaved. 7921-1
43:15 And the men 582 took 3947-4 that 2063 present, 4503 and they took 3947-1 double 4932 money 3701 in their hand, 3027 and Benjamin; 1144 and rose up, 6965-4 and went down 3381-4 to Egypt, 4714 and stood 5975-4 before 6440 Joseph. 3130
43:16 And when Joseph 3130 saw 7200-4 Benjamin 1144 with them, 854 he said 559-4 to the ruler of his house, 1004 Bring 935-54 [these] men 582 home, 1004 and slay, 2873-2 2874 and make ready; 3559-54 for [these] men 582 shall dine 398-4 with me at noon. 6672
43:17 And the man 376 did 6213-4 as Joseph 3130 bade; 559-1 and the man 376 brought 935-55 the men 582 into Joseph's 3130 house. 1004
43:18 And the men 582 were afraid, 3372-4 because they were brought into 935-90 Joseph's 3130 house; 1004 and they said, 559-4 Because of 1697 the money 3701 that was returned 7725-6 in our sacks 572 at the first time 8462 are we brought in; 935-94 that he may seek occasion 1556-106 against us, and fall 5307-99 upon us, and take 3947-2 us for bondmen, 5650 and our asses. 2543
43:19 And they came near 5066-4 to the steward 376 of Joseph's 3130 house, 1004 and they communed 1696-17 with him at the door 6607 of the house, 1004
43:20 And said, 559-4 O 994 sir, 113 we came indeed 3381-2 down 3381-1 at the first time 8462 to buy 7666-2 food: 400
43:21 And it came to pass, when we came 935-1 to the inn, 4411 that we opened 6605-4 our sacks, 572 and, behold, [every] man's 376 money 3701 [was] in the mouth 6310 of his sack, 572 our money 3701 in full weight: 4948 and we have brought it again 7725-55 in our hand. 3027
43:22 And other 312 money 3701 have we brought down 3381-52 in our hands 3027 to buy 7666-2 food: 400 we cannot tell 3045-1 who put 7760-1 our money 3701 in our sacks. 572
43:23 And he said, 559-4 Peace 7965 [be] to you, fear 3372-4 not: your God, 430 and the God 430 of your father, 1 hath given 5414-1 you treasure 4301 in your sacks: 572 I had 935-1 your money. 3701 And he brought Simeon 8095 out 3318-55 unto them.
43:24 And the man 376 brought 935-55 the men 582 into Joseph's 3130 house, 1004 and gave 5414-4 [them] water, 4325 and they washed 7364-4 their feet; 7272 and he gave 5414-4 their asses 2543 provender. 4554
43:25 And they made ready 3559-55 the present 4503 against 5704 Joseph 3130 came 935-2 at noon: 6672 for they heard 8085-1 that they should eat 398-4 bread 3899 there.
43:26 And when Joseph 3130 came 935-4 home, 1004 they brought 935-55 him the present 4503 which [was] in their hand 3027 into the house, 1004 and bowed 7812-101 themselves to him to the earth. 776
43:27 And he asked 7592-4 them of [their] welfare, 7965 and said, 559-4 [Is] your father 1 well, 7965 the old man 2205 of whom ye spake? 559-1 [Is] he yet alive? 2416
43:28 And they answered, 559-4 Thy servant 5650 our father 1 [is] in good health, 7965 he [is] yet alive. 2416 And they bowed down their heads, 6915-4 and made obeisance. 7812-101
43:29 And he lifted up 5375-4 his eyes, 5869 and saw 7200-4 his brother 251 Benjamin, 1144 his mother's 517 son, 1121 and said, 559-4 [Is] this your younger 6996 brother, 251 of whom ye spake 559-1 unto me? And he said, 559-4 God 430 be gracious 2603-4 unto thee, my son. 1121
43:30 And Joseph 3130 made haste; 4116-17 for his bowels 7356 did yearn 3648-8 upon his brother: 251 and he sought 1245-17 [where] to weep; 1058-2 and he entered 935-4 into [his] chamber, 2315 and wept 1058-4 there.
43:31 And he washed 7364-4 his face, 6440 and went out, 3318-4 and refrained 662-101 himself, and said, 559-4 Set on 7760-3 bread. 3899
43:32 And they set on 7760-4 for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, 4713 which did eat 398-6 with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians 4713 might 3201-4 not eat 398-2 bread 3899 with the Hebrews; 5680 for that [is] an abomination 8441 unto the Egyptians. 4714
43:33 And they sat 3427-4 before 6440 him, the firstborn 1060 according to his birthright, 1062 and the youngest 6810 according to his youth: 6812 and the men 582 marvelled 8539-4 one 376 at another. 7453
43:34 And he took 5375-4 [and sent] messes 4864 unto them from before 6440 him: but Benjamin's 1144 mess 4864 was five 2568 times 3027 so much 7235-4 as 4864 any of theirs. And they drank, 8354-4 and were merry 7937-4 with him.
44:1 And he commanded 6680-17 the steward of his house, 1004 saying, 559-2 Fill 4390-16 the men's 582 sacks 572 [with] food, 400 as much as 834 they can 3201-4 carry, 5375-2 and put 7760-3 every man's 376 money 3701 in his sack's 572 mouth. 6310
44:2 And put 7760-4 my cup, 1375 the silver 3701 cup, 1375 in the sack's 572 mouth 6310 of the youngest, 6996 and his corn 7668 money. 3701 And he did 6213-4 according to the word 1697 that Joseph 3130 had spoken. 1696-14
44:3 As soon as the morning 1242 was light, 215-1 the men 582 were sent away, 7971-27 they and their asses. 2543
44:4 [And] when they were gone out 3318-1 of the city, 5892 [and] not [yet] far off, 7368-52 Joseph 3130 said 559-1 unto his steward, 1004 Up, 6965-3 follow 7291-3 after 310 the men; 582 and when thou dost overtake 5381-52 them, say 559-1 unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded 7999-14 evil 7451 for good? 2896
44:5 [Is] not this [it] in which my lord 113 drinketh, 8354-4 and whereby indeed 5172-15 he divineth? 5172-17 ye have done evil 7489-52 in so doing. 6213-1
44:6 And he overtook 5381-55 them, and he spake 1696-17 unto them these same 428 words. 1697
44:7 And they said 559-4 unto him, Wherefore saith 1696-17 my lord 113 these words? 1697 God forbid 2486 that thy servants 5650 should do 6213-2 according to this thing: 1697
44:8 Behold, the money, 3701 which we found 4672-1 in our sacks' 572 mouths, 6310 we brought again 7725-52 unto thee out of the land 776 of Canaan: 3667 how then should we steal 1589-4 out of thy lord's 113 house 1004 silver 3701 or gold? 2091
44:9 With whomsoever of thy servants 5650 it be found, 4672-11 both let him die, 4191-1 and we also will be my lord's 113 bondmen. 5650
44:10 And he said, 559-4 Now also [let] it [be] according unto your words: 1697 3651 he with whom it is found 4672-11 shall be my servant; 5650 and ye shall be blameless. 5355
44:11 Then they speedily 4116-17 took down 3381-55 every man 376 his sack 572 to the ground, 776 and opened 6605-4 every man 376 his sack. 572
44:12 And he searched, 2664-17 [and] began 2490-52 at the eldest, 1419 and left 3615-14 at the youngest: 6996 and the cup 1375 was found 4672-11 in Benjamin's 1144 sack. 572
44:13 Then they rent 7167-4 their clothes, 8071 and laded 6006-4 every man 376 his ass, 2543 and returned 7725-4 to the city. 5892
44:14 And Judah 3063 and his brethren 251 came 935-4 to Joseph's 3130 house; 1004 for he [was] yet there: and they fell 5307-4 before 6440 him on the ground. 776
44:15 And Joseph 3130 said 559-4 unto them, What deed 4639 [is] this that ye have done? 6213-1 wot ye 3045-1 not that such a man 376 as I can certainly 5172-15 divine? 5172-17
44:16 And Judah 3063 said, 559-4 What shall we say 559-4 unto my lord? 113 what shall we speak? 1696-17 or how shall we clear 6663-101 ourselves? God 430 hath found out 4672-1 the iniquity 5771 of thy servants: 5650 behold, we [are] my lord's 113 servants, 5650 both 1571 we, and [he] also 1571 with whom 834 3027 the cup 1375 is found. 4672-8
44:17 And he said, 559-4 God forbid 2486 that I should do 6213-2 so: 2063 [but] the man 376 in whose hand 3027 the cup 1375 is found, 4672-8 he shall be my servant; 5650 and as for you, get you up 5927-3 in peace 7965 unto your father. 1
44:18 Then Judah 3063 came near 5066-4 unto him, and said, 559-4 Oh 994 my lord, 113 let thy servant, 5650 I pray thee, speak 1696-17 a word 1697 in my lord's 113 ears, 241 and let not thine anger 639 burn 2734-4 against thy servant: 5650 for thou [art] even as Pharaoh. 6547
44:19 My lord 113 asked 7592-1 his servants, 5650 saying, 559-2 Have 3426 ye a father, 1 or a brother? 251
44:20 And we said 559-4 unto my lord, 113 We have 3426 a father, 1 an old man, 2205 and a child 3206 of his old age, 2208 a little one; 6996 and his brother 251 is dead, 4191-1 and he alone is left 3498-11 of his mother, 517 and his father 1 loveth 157-1 him.
44:21 And thou saidst 559-4 unto thy servants, 5650 Bring him down 3381-54 unto me, that I may set 7760-4 mine eyes 5869 upon him.
44:22 And we said 559-4 unto my lord, 113 The lad 5288 cannot 3808 3201-4 leave 5800-2 his father: 1 for [if] he should leave 5800-1 his father, 1 [his father] would die. 4191-1
44:23 And thou saidst 559-4 unto thy servants, 5650 Except 3808 your youngest 6996 brother 251 come down 3381-4 with you, ye shall see 7200-2 my face 6440 no more. 3254-55
44:24 And it came to pass when we came up 5927-1 unto thy servant 5650 my father, 1 we told 5046-55 him the words 1697 of my lord. 113
44:25 And our father 1 said, 559-4 Go again, 7725-3 [and] buy 7666-3 us a little 4592 food. 400
44:26 And we said, 559-4 We cannot 3808 3201-4 go down: 3381-2 if our youngest 6996 brother 251 be 3426 with us, then will we go down: 3381-1 for we may 3201-4 not see 7200-2 the man's 376 face, 6440 except 369 our youngest 6996 brother 251 [be] with us.
44:27 And thy servant 5650 my father 1 said 559-4 unto us, Ye know 3045-1 that my wife 802 bare 3205-1 me two 8147 [sons]:
44:28 And the one 259 went out 3318-4 from me, and I said, 559-4 Surely 2963-2 he is torn in pieces; 2963-19 and I saw 7200-1 him not since: 2008
44:29 And if ye take 3947-1 this also from 5973 me, 6440 and mischief 611 befall 7136-1 him, ye shall bring down 3381-52 my gray hairs 7872 with sorrow 7451 to the grave. 7585
44:30 Now therefore when I come 935-2 to thy servant 5650 my father, 1 and the lad 5288 [be] not with us; seeing that his life 5315 is bound up 7194-7 in the lad's life; 5315
44:31 It shall come to pass, when he seeth 7200-2 that the lad 5288 [is] not [with us], that he will die: 4191-1 and thy servants 5650 shall bring down 3381-52 the gray hairs 7872 of thy servant 5650 our father 1 with sorrow 3015 to the grave. 7585
44:32 For thy servant 5650 became surety 6148-1 for the lad 5288 unto 5973 my father, 1 saying, 559-2 If I bring 935-55 him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame 2398-1 to my father 1 for ever. 3117
44:33 Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant 5650 abide 3427-4 instead of the lad 5288 a bondman 5650 to my lord; 113 and let the lad 5288 go up 5927-4 with his brethren. 251
44:34 For how 349 shall I go up 5927-4 to my father, 1 and the lad 5288 [be] not with me? lest peradventure I see 7200-4 the evil 7451 that shall come on 4672-4 my father. 1
45:1 Then Joseph 3130 could 3201-1 not refrain 662-99 himself before all them that stood 5324-12 by him; and he cried, 7121-4 Cause every man 376 to go out 3318-54 from me. And there stood 5975-1 no man 376 with him, while Joseph 3130 made himself known 3045-99 unto his brethren. 251
45:2 And he 5414-4 wept 1065 aloud: 6963 and the Egyptians 4714 and the house 1004 of Pharaoh 6547 heard. 8085-4 8085-4
45:3 And Joseph 3130 said 559-4 unto his brethren, 251 I [am] Joseph; 3130 doth my father 1 yet live? 2416 And his brethren 251 could 3201-1 not answer 6030-2 him; for they were troubled 926-8 at his presence. 6440
45:4 And Joseph 3130 said 559-4 unto his brethren, 251 Come near 5066-3 to me, I pray you. And they came near. 5066-4 And he said, 559-4 I [am] Joseph 3130 your brother, 251 whom ye sold 4376-1 into Egypt. 4714
45:5 Now therefore be not grieved, 6087-11 nor angry 2734-4 with yourselves, 5869 that ye sold 4376-1 me hither: for God 430 did send 7971-1 me before 6440 you to preserve life. 4241
45:6 For these two years 8141 [hath] the famine 7458 [been] in 7130 the land: 776 and yet [there are] five 2568 years, 8141 in the which [there shall] neither 369 [be] earing 2758 nor harvest. 7105
45:7 And God 430 sent 7971-4 me before 6440 you to preserve 7760-2 you a posterity 7611 in the earth, 776 and to save your lives 2421-53 by a great 1419 deliverance. 6413
45:8 So now [it was] not you [that] sent 7971-1 me hither, but God: 430 and he hath made 7760-4 me a father 1 to Pharaoh, 6547 and lord 113 of all his house, 1004 and a ruler 4910-6 throughout all the land 776 of Egypt. 4714
45:9 Haste 4116-16 ye, and go up 5927-3 to my father, 1 and say 559-1 unto him, Thus saith 559-1 thy son 1121 Joseph, 3130 God 430 hath made 7760-1 me lord 113 of all Egypt: 4714 come down 3381-3 unto me, tarry 5975-4 not:
45:10 And thou shalt dwell 3427-1 in the land 776 of Goshen, 1657 and thou shalt be near 7138 unto me, thou, and thy children, 1121 and thy children's 1121 children, 1121 and thy flocks, 6629 and thy herds, 1241 and all that thou hast:
45:11 And there will I nourish 3557-43 thee; for yet [there are] five 2568 years 8141 of famine; 7458 lest thou, and thy household, 1004 and all that thou hast, come to poverty. 3423-11
45:12 And, behold, your eyes 5869 see, 7200-6 and the eyes 5869 of my brother 251 Benjamin, 1144 that [it is] my mouth 6310 that speaketh 1696-18 unto you.
45:13 And ye shall tell 5046-52 my father 1 of all my glory 3519 in Egypt, 4714 and of all that ye have seen; 7200-1 and ye shall haste 4116-14 and bring down 3381-52 my father 1 hither.
45:14 And he fell 5307-4 upon his brother 251 Benjamin's 1144 neck, 6677 and wept; 1058-4 and Benjamin 1144 wept 1058-1 upon his neck. 6677
45:15 Moreover he kissed 5401-17 all his brethren, 251 and wept 1058-4 upon them: and after 310 that his brethren 251 talked 1696-14 with him.
45:16 And the fame 6963 thereof was heard 8085-8 in Pharaoh's 6547 house, 1004 saying, 559-2 Joseph's 3130 brethren 251 are come: 935-1 and it pleased 3190-4 Pharaoh 6547 well, 5869 and 5869 his servants. 5650
45:17 And Pharaoh 6547 said 559-4 unto Joseph, 3130 Say 559-3 unto thy brethren, 251 This do 6213-3 ye; lade 2943-3 your beasts, 1165 and go, 3212-3 get 935-3 you unto the land 776 of Canaan; 3667
45:18 And take 3947-3 your father 1 and your households, 1004 and come 935-3 unto me: and I will give 5414-4 you the good 2898 of the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 and ye shall eat 398-3 the fat 2459 of the land. 776
45:19 Now thou art commanded, 6680-27 this do 6213-3 ye; take 3947-3 you wagons 5699 out of the land 776 of Egypt 4714 for your little ones, 2945 and for your wives, 802 and bring 5375-1 your father, 1 and come. 935-1
45:20 Also 5869 regard 2347-4 not your stuff; 3627 for the good 2898 of all the land 776 of Egypt 4714 [is] yours.
45:21 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 did 6213-4 so: and Joseph 3130 gave 5414-4 them wagons, 5699 according to the commandment 6310 of Pharaoh, 6547 and gave 5414-4 them provision 6720 for the way. 1870
45:22 To all of them he gave 5414-1 each man 376 changes 2487 of raiment; 8071 but to Benjamin 1144 he gave 5414-1 three 7969 hundred 3967 [pieces] of silver, 3701 and five 2568 changes 2487 of raiment. 8071
45:23 And to his father 1 he sent 7971-1 after this 2063 [manner]; ten 6235 asses 2543 laden 5375-6 with the good things 2898 of Egypt, 4714 and ten 6235 she asses 860 laden 5375-6 with corn 1250 and bread 3899 and meat 4202 for his father 1 by the way. 1870
45:24 So he sent his brethren 251 away, 7971-17 and they departed: 3212-4 and he said 559-4 unto them, See that ye fall not out 7264-4 by the way. 1870
45:25 And they went up 5927-4 out of Egypt, 4714 and came 935-4 into the land 776 of Canaan 3667 unto Jacob 3290 their father, 1
45:26 And told 5046-55 him, saying, 559-2 Joseph 3130 [is] yet alive, 2416 and he [is] governor 4910-6 over all the land 776 of Egypt. 4714 And Jacob's heart 3820 fainted, 6313-4 for he believed 539-52 them not.
45:27 And they told 1696-17 him all the words 1697 of Joseph, 3130 which he had said 1696-14 unto them: and when he saw 7200-4 the wagons 5699 which Joseph 3130 had sent 7971-1 to carry 5375-2 him, the spirit 7307 of Jacob 3290 their father 1 revived: 2421-4
45:28 And Israel 3478 said, 559-4 [It is] enough; 7227 Joseph 3130 my son 1121 [is] yet alive: 2416 I will go 3212-4 and see 7200-4 him before I die. 4191-4
46:1 And Israel 3478 took his journey 5265-4 with all that he had, and came 935-4 to Beersheba, 884 and offered 2076-4 sacrifices 2077 unto the God 430 of his father 1 Isaac. 3327
46:2 And God 430 spake 559-4 unto Israel 3478 in the visions 4759 of the night, 3915 and said, 559-4 Jacob, 3290 Jacob. 3290 And he said, 559-4 Here [am] I.
46:3 And he said, 559-4 I [am] God, 410 the God 430 of thy father: 1 fear 3372-4 not to go down 3381-2 into Egypt; 4714 for I will there make 7760-4 of thee a great 1419 nation: 1471
46:4 I will go down 3381-4 with thee into Egypt; 4714 and I will also surely 5927-2 bring thee up 5927-55 [again]: and Joseph 3130 shall put 7896-4 his hand 3027 upon thine eyes. 5869
46:5 And Jacob 3290 rose up 6965-4 from Beersheba: 884 and the sons 1121 of Israel 3478 carried 5375-4 Jacob 3290 their father, 1 and their little ones, 2945 and their wives, 802 in the wagons 5699 which Pharaoh 6547 had sent 7971-1 to carry 5375-2 him.
46:6 And they took 3947-4 their cattle, 4735 and their goods, 7399 which they had gotten 7408-1 in the land 776 of Canaan, 3667 and came 935-4 into Egypt, 4714 Jacob, 3290 and all his seed 2233 with him:
46:7 His sons, 1121 and his sons' 1121 sons 1121 with him, his daughters, 1323 and his sons' 1121 daughters, 1323 and all his seed 2233 brought he 935-52 with him into Egypt. 4714
46:8 And these [are] the names 8034 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 which came 935-6 into Egypt, 4714 Jacob 3290 and his sons: 1121 Reuben, 7205 Jacob's 3290 firstborn. 1060

46:26 All the souls 5315 that came 935-6 with Jacob 3290 into Egypt, 4714 which came out 3318-6 of his loins, 3409 besides Jacob's 3290 sons' 1121 wives, 802 all the souls 5315 [were] threescore 8346 and six; 8337

46:28 And he sent 7971-1 Judah 3063 before 6440 him unto Joseph, 3130 to direct 3384-53 his face 6440 unto Goshen; 1657 and they came 935-4 into the land 776 of Goshen. 1657
46:29 And Joseph 3130 made ready 631-4 his chariot, 4818 and went up 5927-4 to meet 7125-2 Israel 3478 his father, 1 to Goshen, 1657 and presented 7200-11 himself unto him; and he fell 5307-4 on his neck, 6677 and wept 1058-4 on his neck 6677 a good while. 5750
46:30 And Israel 3478 said 559-4 unto Joseph, 3130 Now 6471 let me die, 4191-4 since 310 I have seen 7200-2 thy face, 6440 because thou [art] yet 5750 alive. 2416
46:31 And Joseph 3130 said 559-4 unto his brethren, 251 and unto his father's 1 house, 1004 I will go up, 5927-4 and shew 5046-55 Pharaoh, 6547 and say 559-4 unto him, My brethren, 251 and my father's 1 house, 1004 which [were] in the land 776 of Canaan, 3667 are come 935-1 unto me;
46:32 And the men 582 [are] shepherds, 7462-6 6629 for their trade hath been to feed cattle; 582 4735 and they have brought 935-52 their flocks, 6629 and their herds, 1241 and all that they have.
46:33 And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh 6547 shall call 7121-4 you, and shall say, 559-1 What [is] your occupation? 4639
46:34 That ye shall say, 559-1 Thy servants' 5650 trade hath been about cattle 582 4735 from our youth 5271 even until now, both we, [and] also our fathers: 1 that ye may dwell 3427-4 in the land 776 of Goshen; 1657 for every shepherd 7462-6 6629 [is] an abomination 8441 unto the Egyptians. 4714
47:1 Then Joseph 3130 came 935-4 and told 5046-55 Pharaoh, 6547 and said, 559-4 My father 1 and my brethren, 251 and their flocks, 6629 and their herds, 1241 and all that they have, are come 935-1 out of the land 776 of Canaan; 3667 and, behold, they [are] in the land 776 of Goshen. 1657
47:2 And he took 3947-1 some 7097 of his brethren, 251 [even] five 2568 men, 582 and presented 3322-55 them unto 6440 Pharaoh. 6547
47:3 And Pharaoh 6547 said 559-4 unto his brethren, 251 What [is] your occupation? 4639 And they said 559-4 unto Pharaoh, 6547 Thy servants 5650 [are] shepherds, 7462-6 6629 both we, [and] also our fathers. 1
47:4 They said 559-4 moreover unto Pharaoh, 6547 For to sojourn 1481-2 in the land 776 are we come; 935-1 for thy servants 5650 have no pasture 4829 for their flocks; 6629 for the famine 7458 [is] sore 3515 in the land 776 of Canaan: 3667 now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants 5650 dwell 3427-4 in the land 776 of Goshen. 1657
47:5 And Pharaoh 6547 spake 559-4 unto Joseph, 3130 saying, 559-2 Thy father 1 and thy brethren 251 are come 935-1 unto thee:
47:6 The land 776 of Egypt 4714 [is] before 6440 thee; in the best 4315 of the land 776 make thy father 1 and brethren 251 to dwell; 3427-54 in the land 776 of Goshen 1657 let them dwell: 3427-4 and if thou knowest 3045-1 3426 [any] men 582 of activity 2428 among them, then make 7760-1 them rulers 8269 over my cattle. 4735
47:7 And Joseph 3130 brought in 935-55 Jacob 3290 his father, 1 and set 5975-55 him before 6440 Pharaoh: 6547 and Jacob 3290 blessed 1288-17 Pharaoh. 6547
47:8 And Pharaoh 6547 said 559-4 unto Jacob, 3290 How 4100 old 2416 3117 8141 [art] thou?
47:9 And Jacob 3290 said 559-4 unto Pharaoh, 6547 The days 3117 of the years 8141 of my pilgrimage 4033 [are] an hundred 3967 and thirty 7970 years: 8141 few 4592 and evil 7451 have the days 3117 of the years 8141 of my life 2416 been, and have not attained 5381-52 unto the days 3117 of the years 8141 of the life 2416 of my fathers 1 in the days 3117 of their pilgrimage. 4033
47:10 And Jacob 3290 blessed 1288-17 Pharaoh, 6547 and went out 3318-4 from before 6440 Pharaoh. 6547
47:11 And Joseph 3130 placed 3427-55 his father 1 and his brethren, 251 and gave 5414-4 them a possession 272 in the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 in the best 4315 of the land, 776 in the land 776 of Rameses, 7486 as Pharaoh 6547 had commanded. 6680-14
47:12 And Joseph 3130 nourished 3557-46 his father, 1 and his brethren, 251 and all his father's 1 household, 1004 with bread, 3899 according 6310 to [their] families. 2945
47:13 And [there was] no bread 3899 in all the land; 776 for the famine 7458 [was] very 3966 sore, 3515 so that the land 776 of Egypt 4714 and [all] the land 776 of Canaan 3667 fainted 3856-4 by reason 6440 of the famine. 7458
47:14 And Joseph 3130 gathered up 3950-17 all the money 3701 that was found 4672-12 in the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 and in the land 776 of Canaan, 3667 for the corn 7668 which they bought: 7666-6 and Joseph 3130 brought 935-55 the money 3701 into Pharaoh's 6547 house. 1004
47:15 And when money 3701 failed 8552-4 in the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 and in the land 776 of Canaan, 3667 all the Egyptians 4714 came 935-4 unto Joseph, 3130 and said, 559-2 Give 3051-3 us bread: 3899 for why should we die 4191-4 in thy presence? for the money 3701 faileth. 656-1
47:16 And Joseph 3130 said, 559-4 Give 3051-3 your cattle; 4735 and I will give 5414-4 you for your cattle, 4735 if money 3701 fail. 656-1
47:17 And they brought 935-55 their cattle 4735 unto Joseph: 3130 and Joseph 3130 gave 5414-4 them bread 3899 [in exchange] for horses, 5483 and for 4735 the flocks, 6629 and for the cattle 4735 of the herds, 1241 and for the asses: 2543 and he fed 5095-17 them with bread 3899 for all their cattle 4735 for that year. 8141
47:18 When that year 8141 was ended, 8552-4 they came 935-4 unto him the second 8145 year, 8141 and said 559-4 unto him, We will not hide 3582-17 [it] from my lord, 113 how that our money 3701 is spent; 8552-1 my lord 113 also hath 413 our herds 4735 of cattle; 929 there is not ought left 7604-8 in the sight 6440 of my lord, 113 but our bodies, 1472 and our lands: 127
47:19 Wherefore shall we die 4191-4 before thine eyes, 5869 both we and our land? 127 buy 7069-3 us and our land 127 for bread, 3899 and we and our land 127 will be servants 5650 unto Pharaoh: 6547 and give 5414-3 [us] seed, 2233 that we may live, 2421-4 and not die, 4191-4 that the land 127 be not desolate. 3456-4
47:20 And Joseph 3130 bought 7069-4 all the land 127 of Egypt 4714 for Pharaoh; 6547 for the Egyptians 4714 sold 4376-1 every man 376 his field, 7704 because the famine 7458 prevailed 2388-1 over them: so the land 776 became Pharaoh's. 6547
47:21 And as for the people, 5971 he removed 5674-52 them to cities 5892 from [one] end 7097 of the borders 1366 of Egypt 4714 even to the [other] end 7097 thereof.
47:22 Only the land 127 of the priests 3548 bought 7069-1 he not; for the priests 3548 had a portion 2706 [assigned them] of Pharaoh, 6547 and did eat 398-1 their portion 2706 which Pharaoh 6547 gave 5414-1 them: wherefore they sold 4376-1 not their lands. 127
47:23 Then Joseph 3130 said 559-4 unto the people, 5971 Behold, I have bought 7069-1 853 you this day 3117 and your land 127 for Pharaoh: 6547 lo, 1887 [here is] seed 2233 for you, and ye shall sow 2232-1 the land. 127
47:24 And it shall come to pass in the increase, 8393 that ye shall give 5414-1 the fifth 2549 [part] unto Pharaoh, 6547 and four 702 parts 3027 shall be your own, for seed 2233 of the field, 7704 and for your food, 400 and for them of your households, 1004 and for food 398-2 for your little ones. 2945
47:25 And they said, 559-4 Thou hast saved our lives: 2421-52 let us find 4672-4 grace 2580 in the sight 5869 of my lord, 113 and we will be Pharaoh's 6547 servants. 5650
47:26 And Joseph 3130 made 7760-4 it a law 2706 over the land 127 of Egypt 4714 unto this day, 3117 [that] Pharaoh 6547 should have the fifth 2569 [part]; except 7535 the land 127 of the priests 3548 only, [which] became not Pharaoh's. 6547
47:27 And Israel 3478 dwelt 3427-4 in the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 in the country 776 of Goshen; 1657 and they had possessions 270-11 therein, and grew, 6509-4 and multiplied 7235-4 exceedingly. 3966
47:28 And Jacob 3290 lived 2421-4 in the land 776 of Egypt 4714 seventeen 6240 7651 years: 8141 so the whole age 3117 8141 2416 of Jacob 3290 was an hundred 3967 8141 forty 705 and seven 7651 years. 8141
47:29 And the time 3117 drew nigh 7126-4 that Israel 3478 must die: 4191-2 and he called 7121-4 his son 1121 Joseph, 3130 and said 559-4 unto him, If now I have found 4672-1 grace 2580 in thy sight, 5869 put, 7760-3 I pray thee, thy hand 3027 under my thigh, 3409 and deal 6213-1 kindly 2617 and truly 571 with me; bury 6912-4 me not, I pray thee, in Egypt: 4714
47:30 But I will lie 7901-1 with my fathers, 1 and thou shalt carry 5375-1 me out of Egypt, 4714 and bury 6912-1 me in their buryingplace. 6900 And he said, 559-4 I will do 6213-4 as thou hast said. 1697
47:31 And he said, 559-4 Swear 7650-10 unto me. And he sware 7650-11 unto him. And Israel 3478 bowed 7812-101 himself upon the bed's 4296 head. 7218
48:1 And it came to pass after 310 these things, 1697 that [one] told 559-4 Joseph, 3130 Behold, thy father 1 [is] sick: 2470-6 and he took 3947-4 with him his two 8147 sons, 1121 Manasseh 4519 and Ephraim. 669
48:2 And [one] told 5046-55 Jacob, 3290 and said, 559-4 Behold, thy son 1121 Joseph 3130 cometh 935-6 unto thee: and Israel 3478 strengthened 2388-101 himself, and sat 3427-4 upon the bed. 4296
48:3 And Jacob 3290 said 559-4 unto Joseph, 3130 God 410 Almighty 7706 appeared 7200-8 unto me at Luz 3870 in the land 776 of Canaan, 3667 and blessed 1288-17 me,
48:4 And said 559-4 unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, 6509-56 and multiply 7235-52 thee, and I will make 5414-1 of thee a multitude 6951 of people; 5971 and will give 5414-1 this land 776 to thy seed 2233 after 310 thee [for] an everlasting 5769 possession. 272
48:5 And now thy two 8147 sons, 1121 Ephraim 669 and Manasseh, 4519 which were born 3205-12 unto thee in the land 776 of Egypt 4714 before 5704 I came 935-2 unto thee into Egypt, 4714 [are] mine; as Reuben 7205 and Simeon, 8095 they shall be mine.
48:6 And thy issue, 4138 which thou begettest 3205-52 after 310 them, shall be thine, [and] shall be called 7121-11 after 5921 the name 8034 of their brethren 251 in their inheritance. 5159
48:7 And as for me, when I came 935-2 from Padan, 6307 Rachel 7354 died 4191-1 by me in the land 776 of Canaan 3667 in the way, 1870 when 5750 yet [there was] but a little 3530 way 776 to come 935-2 unto Ephrath: 672 and I buried 6912-4 her there in the way 1870 of Ephrath; 672 the same [is] Bethlehem. 1035
48:8 And Israel 3478 beheld 7200-4 Joseph's 3130 sons, 1121 and said, 559-4 Who [are] these?
48:9 And Joseph 3130 said 559-4 unto his father, 1 They [are] my sons, 1121 whom God 430 hath given 5414-1 me in this [place]. And he said, 559-4 Bring them, 3947-3 I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless 1288-17 them.
48:10 Now the eyes 5869 of Israel 3478 were dim 3513-1 for age, 2207 [so that] he could 3201-4 not see. 7200-2 And he brought them near 5066-55 unto him; and he kissed 5401-4 them, and embraced 2263-17 them.
48:11 And Israel 3478 said 559-4 unto Joseph, 3130 I had not thought 6419-14 to see 7200-2 thy face: 6440 and, lo, God 430 hath shewed 7200-52 me also thy seed. 2233
48:12 And Joseph 3130 brought them out 3318-55 from between 5973 his knees, 1290 and he bowed 7812-101 himself with his face 639 to the earth. 776
48:13 And Joseph 3130 took 3947-4 them both, 8147 Ephraim 669 in his right hand 3225 toward Israel's 3478 left hand, 8040 and Manasseh 4519 in his left hand 8040 toward Israel's 3478 right hand, 3225 and brought [them] near 5066-55 unto him.
48:14 And Israel 3478 stretched out 7971-4 his right hand, 3225 and laid 7896-4 [it] upon Ephraim's 669 head, 7218 who [was] the younger, 6810 and his left hand 8040 upon Manasseh's 4519 head, 7218 guiding his hands 3027 wittingly; 7919-14 for Manasseh 4519 [was] the firstborn. 1060
48:15 And he blessed 1288-17 Joseph, 3130 and said, 559-4 God, 430 before 6440 whom my fathers 1 Abraham 85 and Isaac 3327 did walk, 1980-98 the God 430 which fed 7462-6 me all my life long 5750 unto this day, 3117
48:16 The Angel 4397 which redeemed 1350-6 me from all evil, 7451 bless 1288-17 the lads; 5288 and let my name 8034 be named 7121-11 on them, and the name 8034 of my fathers 1 Abraham 85 and Isaac; 3327 and let them grow 1711-4 into a multitude 7230 in the midst 7130 of the earth. 776
48:17 And when Joseph 3130 saw 7200-4 that his father 1 laid 7896-4 his right 3225 hand 3027 upon the head 7218 of Ephraim, 669 it displeased 3415-4 5869 him: and he held up 8551-4 his father's 1 hand, 3027 to remove 5493-53 it from Ephraim's 669 head 7218 unto Manasseh's 4519 head. 7218
48:18 And Joseph 3130 said 559-4 unto his father, 1 Not so, my father: 1 for this [is] the firstborn; 1060 put 7760-3 thy right hand 3225 upon his head. 7218
48:19 And his father 1 refused, 3985-17 and said, 559-4 I know 3045-1 [it], my son, 1121 I know 3045-1 [it]: he also shall become a people, 5971 and he also shall be great: 1431-4 but truly 199 his younger 6996 brother 251 shall be greater 1431-4 than he, and his seed 2233 shall become a multitude 4393 of nations. 1471
48:20 And he blessed 1288-17 them that day, 3117 saying, 559-2 In thee shall Israel 3478 bless, 1288-17 saying, 559-2 God 430 make 7760-4 thee as Ephraim 669 and as Manasseh: 4519 and he set 7760-4 Ephraim 669 before 6440 Manasseh. 4519
48:21 And Israel 3478 said 559-4 unto Joseph, 3130 Behold, I die: 4191-5 but God 430 shall be with you, and bring you again 7725-52 unto the land 776 of your fathers. 1
48:22 Moreover I have given 5414-1 to thee one 259 portion 7926 above thy brethren, 251 which I took 3947-1 out of the hand 3027 of the Amorite 567 with my sword 2719 and with my bow. 7198
49:1 And Jacob 3290 called 7121-4 unto his sons, 1121 and said, 559-4 Gather 622-10 yourselves together, that I may tell 5046-55 you [that] which shall befall 7122-4 you in the last 319 days. 3117
49:2 Gather yourselves together, 6908-10 and hear, 8085-3 ye sons 1121 of Jacob; 3290 and hearken 8085-3 unto Israel 3478 your father. 1
49:3 Reuben, 7205 thou [art] my firstborn, 1060 my might, 3581 and the beginning 7225 of my strength, 202 the excellency 3499 of dignity, 7613 and the excellency 3499 of power: 5794
49:4 Unstable 6349 as water, 4325 thou shalt not excel; 3498-55 because thou wentest up 5927-1 to thy father's 1 bed; 4904 then defiledst thou 2490-14 [it]: he went up 5927-1 to my couch. 3326
49:5 Simeon 8095 and Levi 3878 [are] brethren; 251 instruments 3627 of cruelty 2555 [are in] their habitations. 4380
49:6 O my soul, 5315 come 935-4 not thou into their secret; 5475 unto their assembly, 6951 mine honour, 3519 be not thou united: 3161-4 for in their anger 639 they slew 2026-1 a man, 376 and in their selfwill 7522 they digged down 6131-14 a wall. 7794
49:7 Cursed 779-7 [be] their anger, 639 for [it was] fierce; 5794 and their wrath, 5678 for it was cruel: 7185-1 I will divide 2505-17 them in Jacob, 3290 and scatter 6327-55 them in Israel. 3478
49:8 Judah, 3063 thou [art he] whom thy brethren 251 shall praise: 3034-55 thy hand 3027 [shall be] in the neck 6203 of thine enemies; 341-6 thy father's 1 children 1121 shall bow down 7812-101 before thee.
49:9 Judah 3063 [is] a lion's 738 whelp: 1484 from the prey, 2964 my son, 1121 thou art gone up: 5927-1 he stooped down, 3766-1 he couched 7257-1 as a lion, 738 and as an old lion; 3833 who shall rouse him up? 6965-55
49:10 The sceptre 7626 shall not depart 5493-4 from Judah, 3063 nor a lawgiver 2710-26 from between his feet, 7272 until 3588 Shiloh 7886 come; 935-4 and unto him [shall] the gathering 3349 of the people 5971 [be].
49:11 Binding 631-6 his foal 5895 unto the vine, 1612 and his ass's 860 colt 1121 unto the choice vine; 8321 he washed 3526-14 his garments 3830 in wine, 3196 and his clothes 5497 in the blood 1818 of grapes: 6025
49:12 His eyes 5869 [shall be] red 2447 with wine, 3196 and his teeth 8127 white 3836 with milk. 2461
49:13 Zebulun 2074 shall dwell 7931-4 at the haven 2348 of the sea; 3220 and he [shall be] for an haven 2348 of ships; 591 and his border 3411 [shall be] unto Zidon. 6721
49:14 Issachar 3485 [is] a strong 1634 ass 2543 couching down 7257-6 between two burdens: 4942
49:15 And he saw 7200-4 that rest 4496 [was] good, 2896 and the land 776 that [it was] pleasant; 5276-1 and bowed 5186-4 his shoulder 7926 to bear, 5445-2 and became a servant 5647-6 unto tribute. 4522
49:16 Dan 1835 shall judge 1777-4 his people, 5971 as one 259 of the tribes 7626 of Israel. 3478
49:17 Dan 1835 shall be a serpent 5175 by the way, 1870 an adder 8207 in the path, 734 that biteth 5391-6 the horse 5483 heels, 6119 so that his rider 7392-6 shall fall 5307-4 backward. 268
49:18 I have waited 6960-14 for thy salvation, 3444 O LORD. 3068
49:19 Gad, 1410 a troop 1416 shall overcome 1464-4 him: but he shall overcome 1464-4 at the last. 6119
49:20 Out of Asher 836 his bread 3899 [shall be] fat, 8082 and he shall yield 5414-4 royal 4428 dainties. 4574
49:21 Naphtali 5321 [is] a hind 355 let loose: 7971-7 he giveth 5414-6 goodly 8233 words. 561
49:22 Joseph 3130 [is] a fruitful 6509-6 bough, 1121 [even] a fruitful 6509-6 bough 1121 by a well; 5869 [whose] branches 1323 run over 6805-1 the wall: 7791
49:23 The archers 1167 2671 have sorely grieved 4843-17 him, and shot 7232-1 [at him], and hated 7852-4 him:
49:24 But his bow 7198 abode 3427-4 in strength, 386 and the arms 2220 of his hands 3027 were made strong 6339-4 by the hands 3027 of the mighty 46 [God] of Jacob; 3290 (from thence [is] the shepherd, 7462-6 the stone 68 of Israel:) 3478
49:25 [Even] by the God 410 of thy father, 1 who shall help 5826-4 thee; and by 854 the Almighty, 7706 who shall bless 1288-17 thee with blessings 1293 of heaven 8064 above, 5920 blessings 1293 of the deep 8415 that lieth 7257-6 under, blessings 1293 of the breasts, 7699 and of the womb: 7356
49:26 The blessings 1293 of thy father 1 have prevailed 1396-1 above the blessings 1293 of my progenitors 2029-6 unto the utmost bound 8379 of the everlasting 5769 hills: 1389 they shall be on the head 7218 of Joseph, 3130 and on the crown of the head 6936 of him that was separate 5139 from his brethren. 251
49:27 Benjamin 1144 shall ravin 2963-4 [as] a wolf: 2061 in the morning 1242 he shall devour 398-4 the prey, 5706 and at night 6153 he shall divide 2505-17 the spoil. 7998
49:28 All these [are] the twelve 6240 8147 tribes 7626 of Israel: 3478 and this [is it] that their father 1 spake 1696-14 unto them, and blessed 1288-17 them; every 834 one 376 according to his blessing 1293 he blessed 1288-14 them.
49:29 And he charged 6680-17 them, and said 559-4 unto them, I am to be gathered 622-12 unto my people: 5971 bury 6912-3 me with my fathers 1 in the cave 4631 that [is] in the field 7704 of Ephron 6085 the Hittite, 2850
49:30 In the cave 4631 that [is] in the field 7704 of Machpelah, 4375 which [is] before 6440 Mamre, 4471 in the land 776 of Canaan, 3667 which Abraham 85 bought 7069-1 with the field 7704 of Ephron 6085 the Hittite 2850 for a possession 272 of a buryingplace. 6913
49:31 There they buried 6912-1 Abraham 85 and Sarah 8283 his wife; 802 there they buried 6912-1 Isaac 3327 and Rebekah 7259 his wife; 802 and there I buried 6912-1 Leah. 3812
49:32 The purchase 4735 of the field 7704 and of the cave 4631 that [is] therein [was] from the children 1121 of Heth. 2845
49:33 And when Jacob 3290 had made an end 3615-17 of commanding 6680-15 his sons, 1121 he gathered 622-4 up his feet 7272 into the bed, 4296 and yielded up the ghost, 1478-4 and was gathered 622-11 unto his people. 5971
50:1 And Joseph 3130 fell 5307-4 upon his father's 1 face, 6440 and wept 1058-4 upon him, and kissed 5401-4 him.
50:2 And Joseph 3130 commanded 6680-17 his servants 5650 the physicians 7495-6 to embalm 2590-2 his father: 1 and the physicians 7495-6 embalmed 2590-4 Israel. 3478
50:3 And forty 705 days 3117 were fulfilled 4390-4 for him; for so are fulfilled 4390-4 the days 3117 of those which are embalmed: 2590-7 and the Egyptians 4714 mourned 1058-4 for him threescore and ten 7657 days. 3117
50:4 And when the days 3117 of his mourning 1068 were past, 5674-4 Joseph 3130 spake 1696-17 unto the house 1004 of Pharaoh, 6547 saying, 559-2 If now I have found 4672-1 grace 2580 in your eyes, 5869 speak, 1696-16 I pray you, in the ears 241 of Pharaoh, 6547 saying, 559-2
50:5 My father 1 made me swear, 7650-52 saying, 559-2 Lo, 2009 I die: 4191-5 in my grave 6913 which I have digged 3738-1 for me in the land 776 of Canaan, 3667 there shalt thou bury 6912-4 me. Now therefore let me go up, 5927-4 I pray thee, and bury 6912-4 my father, 1 and I will come again. 7725-4
50:6 And Pharaoh 6547 said, 559-4 Go up, 5927-3 and bury 6912-3 thy father, 1 according as he made thee swear. 7650-52
50:7 And Joseph 3130 went up 5927-4 to bury 6912-2 his father: 1 and with him went up 5927-4 all the servants 5650 of Pharaoh, 6547 the elders 2205 of his house, 1004 and all the elders 2205 of the land 776 of Egypt, 4714
50:8 And all the house 1004 of Joseph, 3130 and his brethren, 251 and his father's 1 house: 1004 only their little ones, 2945 and their flocks, 6629 and their herds, 1241 they left 5800-1 in the land 776 of Goshen. 1657
50:9 And there went up 5927-4 with him both chariots 7393 and horsemen: 6571 and it was a very 3966 great 3515 company. 4264
50:10 And they came 935-4 to the threshingfloor 1637 of Atad, 329 which [is] beyond 5676 Jordan, 3383 and there they mourned 5594-4 with a great 1419 and very 3966 sore 3515 lamentation: 4553 and he made 6213-4 a mourning 60 for his father 1 seven 7651 days. 3117
50:11 And when the inhabitants 3427-6 of the land, 776 the Canaanites, 3669 saw 7200-4 the mourning 60 in the floor 1637 of Atad, 329 they said, 559-4 This [is] a grievous 3515 mourning 60 to the Egyptians: 4714 wherefore the name 8034 of it was called 7121-1 Abelmizraim, 67 which [is] beyond 5676 Jordan. 3383
50:12 And his sons 1121 did 6213-4 unto him according as he commanded 6680-14 them:
50:13 For his sons 1121 carried 5375-4 him into the land 776 of Canaan, 3667 and buried 6912-4 him in the cave 4631 of the field 7704 of Machpelah, 4375 which Abraham 85 bought 7069-1 with the field 7704 for a possession 272 of a buryingplace 6913 of Ephron 6085 the Hittite, 2850 before 6440 Mamre. 4471
50:14 And Joseph 3130 returned 7725-4 into Egypt, 4714 he, and his brethren, 251 and all that went up 5927-6 with him to bury 6912-2 his father, 1 after 310 he had buried 6912-2 his father. 1
50:15 And when Joseph's 3130 brethren 251 saw 7200-4 that their father 1 was dead, 4191-1 they said, 559-4 Joseph 3130 will peradventure 3863 hate 7852-4 us, and will certainly 7725-53 requite 7725-55 us all the evil 7451 which we did 1580-1 unto him.
50:16 And they sent a messenger 6680-17 unto Joseph, 3130 saying, 559-2 Thy father 1 did command 6680-14 before 6440 he died, 4194 saying, 559-2
50:17 So shall ye say 559-4 unto Joseph, 3130 Forgive, 5375-3 I pray thee 577 now, the trespass 6588 of thy brethren, 251 and their sin; 2403 for they did 1580-1 unto thee evil: 7451 and now, we pray thee, forgive 5375-3 the trespass 6588 of the servants 5650 of the God 430 of thy father. 1 And Joseph 3130 wept 1058-4 when they spake 1696-15 unto him.
50:18 And his brethren 251 also went 3212-4 and fell down 5307-4 before his face; 6440 and they said, 559-4 Behold, we [be] thy servants. 5650
50:19 And Joseph 3130 said 559-4 unto them, Fear 3372-4 not: for [am] I in the place of God? 430
50:20 But as for you, ye thought 2803-1 evil 7451 against me; [but] God 430 meant it 2803-1 unto good, 2896 to 4616 bring to pass, 6213-2 as [it is] this day, 3117 to save much 7227 people 5971 alive. 2421-53
50:21 Now therefore fear 3372-4 ye not: I will nourish 3557-46 you, and your little ones. 2945 And he comforted 5162-17 them, and spake 1696-17 kindly 3820 unto them.
50:22 And Joseph 3130 dwelt 3427-4 in Egypt, 4714 he, and his father's 1 house: 1004 and Joseph 3130 lived 2421-4 an hundred 3967 and ten 6235 years. 8141
50:23 And Joseph 3130 saw 7200-4 Ephraim's 669 children 1121 of the third 8029 [generation]: the children 1121 also of Machir 4353 the son 1121 of Manasseh 4519 were brought up 3205-27 upon Joseph's 3130 knees. 1290
50:24 And Joseph 3130 said 559-4 unto his brethren, 251 I die: 4191-5 and God 430 will surely 6485-2 visit 6485-4 you, and bring 5927-52 you out of this land 776 unto the land 776 which he sware 7650-8 to Abraham, 85 to Isaac, 3327 and to Jacob. 3290
50:25 And Joseph 3130 took an oath 7650-55 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 saying, 559-2 God 430 will surely 6485-2 visit 6485-4 you, and ye shall carry up 5927-52 my bones 6106 from hence. 2088
50:26 So Joseph 3130 died, 4191-4 [being] an hundred 3967 and ten 6235 years 8141 old: 1121 and they embalmed 2590-4 him, and he was put 3455-4 in a coffin 727 in Egypt. 4714
