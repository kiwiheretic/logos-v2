1:1 These [be] the words 1697 which Moses 4872 spake 1696-14 unto all Israel 3478 on this side 5676 Jordan 3383 in the wilderness, 4057 in the plain 6160 over against 4136 the Red 5489|5488 [sea], between Paran, 6290 and Tophel, 8603 and Laban, 3837 and Hazeroth, 2698 and Dizahab. 1774

1:2 ([There are] eleven 259 6240 days' 3117 [journey] from Horeb 2722 by the way 1870 of mount 2022 Seir 8165 unto Kadeshbarnea.) 6947

1:3 And it came to pass in the fortieth 705 year, 8141 in the eleventh 6249 6240 month, 2320 on the first 259 [day] of the month, 2320 [that] Moses 4872 spake 1696-14 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 according unto all that the LORD 3068 had given him in commandment 6680-14 unto them;

1:4 After 310 he had slain 5221-53 Sihon 5511 the king 4428 of the Amorites, 567 which dwelt 3427-6 in Heshbon, 2809 and Og 5747 the king 4428 of Bashan, 1316 which dwelt 3427-6 at Astaroth 6252 in Edrei: 154

1:5 On this side 5676 Jordan, 3383 in the land 776 of Moab, 4124 began 2974-52 Moses 4872 to declare 874-15 this law, 8451 saying, 559-2

1:6 The LORD 3068 our God 430 spake 1696-14 unto us in Horeb, 2722 saying, 559-2 Ye have dwelt 3427-2 long enough 7227 in this mount: 2022

1:7 Turn 6437-3 you, and take your journey, 5265-3 and go 935-3 to the mount 2022 of the Amorites, 567 and unto all [the places] nigh 7934 thereunto, in the plain, 6160 in the hills, 2022 and in the vale, 8219 and in the south, 5045 and by the sea 3220 side, 2348 to the land 776 of the Canaanites, 3669 and unto Lebanon, 3844 unto the great 1419 river, 5104 the river 5104 Euphrates. 6578

1:8 Behold, 7200-3 I have set 5414-1 the land 776 before 6440 you: go in 935-3 and possess 3423-3 the land 776 which the LORD 3068 sware 7650-8 unto your fathers, 1 Abraham, 85 Isaac, 3327 and Jacob, 3290 to give 5414-2 unto them and to their seed 2233 after 310 them.

1:9 And I spake 559-4 unto you at that time, 6256 saying, 559-2 I am not able 3201-4 to bear 5375-2 you myself alone: 905

1:10 The LORD 3068 your God 430 hath multiplied 7235-52 you, and, behold, ye [are] this day 3117 as the stars 3556 of heaven 8064 for multitude. 7230

1:11 (The LORD 3068 God 430 of your fathers 1 make you a thousand 505 times 6471 so many more as 3254-55 ye [are], and bless 1288-17 you, as he hath promised 1696-14 you!)

1:12 How 349 can I myself alone bear 5375-4 your cumbrance, 2960 and your burden, 4853 and your strife? 7379

1:13 Take 3051-3 you wise 2450 men, 582 and understanding, 995-12 and known 3045-7 among your tribes, 7626 and I will make 7760-4 them rulers 7218 over you.

1:14 And ye answered 6030-4 me, and said, 559-4 The thing 1697 which thou hast spoken 1696-14 [is] good 2896 [for us] to do. 6213-2

1:15 So I took 3947-4 the chief 7218 of your tribes, 7626 wise 2450 men, 582 and known, 3045-7 and made 5414-4 them heads 7218 over you, captains 8269 over thousands, 505 and captains 8269 over hundreds, 3967 and captains 8269 over fifties, 2572 and captains 8269 over tens, 6235 and officers 7860-6 among your tribes. 7626

1:16 And I charged 6680-17 your judges 8199-6 at that time, 6256 saying, 559-2 Hear 8085-2 [the causes] between your brethren, 251 and judge 8199-1 righteously 6664 between [every] man 376 and his brother, 251 and the stranger 1616 [that is] with him.

1:17 Ye shall not respect 5234-55 persons 6440 in judgment; 4941 [but] ye shall hear 8085-4 the small 6996 as well as the great; 1419 ye shall not be afraid 1481-4 of the face 6440 of man; 376 for the judgment 4941 [is] God's: 430 and the cause 1697 that is too hard 7185-4 for you, bring 7126-55 [it] unto me, and I will hear 8085-1 it.

1:18 And I commanded 6680-17 you at that time 6256 all the things 1697 which ye should do. 6213-4

1:19 And when we departed 5265-4 from Horeb, 2722 we went 3212-4 through all that great 1419 and terrible 3372-12 wilderness, 4057 which ye saw 7200-1 by the way 1870 of the mountain 2022 of the Amorites, 567 as the LORD 3068 our God 430 commanded 6680-14 us; and we came 935-4 to Kadeshbarnea. 6947

1:20 And I said 559-4 unto you, Ye are come 935-1 unto the mountain 2022 of the Amorites, 567 which the LORD 3068 our God 430 doth give 5414-6 unto us.

1:21 Behold, 7200-3 the LORD 3068 thy God 430 hath set 5414-1 the land 776 before 6440 thee: go up 5927-3 [and] possess 3423-3 [it], as the LORD 3068 God 430 of thy fathers 1 hath said 1696-14 unto thee; fear 3372-4 not, neither be discouraged. 2865-11

1:22 And ye came near 7126-4 unto me every one of you, and said, 559-4 We will send 7971-4 men 582 before 6440 us, and they shall search us out 2658-4 the land, 776 and bring us word 1697 again 7725-55 by what way 1870 we must go up, 5927-4 and into what cities 5892 we shall come. 935-4

1:23 And the saying 1697 pleased 3190-4 me well: 5869 and I took 3947-4 twelve 8147 6240 men 582 of you, one 259 of a tribe: 376 7626

1:24 And they turned 6437-4 and went up 5927-4 into the mountain, 2022 and came 935-4 unto the valley 5158 of Eshcol, 812 and searched it out. 7270-17

1:25 And they took 3947-4 of the fruit 6529 of the land 776 in their hands, 3027 and brought [it] down 3381-55 unto us, and brought us word 1697 again, 7725-55 and said, 559-4 [It is] a good 2896 land 776 which the LORD 3068 our God 430 doth give 5414-6 us.

1:26 Notwithstanding ye would 14-1 not go up, 5927-2 but rebelled 4784-55 against the commandment 6310 of the LORD 3068 your God: 430

1:27 And ye murmured 7279-11 in your tents, 168 and said, 559-4 Because the LORD 3068 hated 8135 us, he hath brought us forth 3318-52 out of the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 to deliver 5414-2 us into the hand 3027 of the Amorites, 567 to destroy 8045-53 us.

1:28 Whither shall we go up? 5927-6 our brethren 251 have discouraged 4549-52 our heart, 3824 saying, 559-2 The people 5971 [is] greater 1419 and taller 7311-6 than we; the cities 5892 [are] great 1419 and walled up 1219-7 to heaven; 8064 and moreover we have seen 7200-1 the sons 1121 of the Anakims 6062 there.

1:29 Then I said 559-4 unto you, Dread 6206-4 not, neither be afraid 3372-4 of them.

1:30 The LORD 3068 your God 430 which goeth 1980-6 before 6440 you, he shall fight 3898-11 for you, according to all that he did 6213-1 for you in Egypt 4714 before your eyes; 5869

1:31 And in the wilderness, 4057 where thou hast seen 7200-1 how that the LORD 3068 thy God 430 bare 5375-1 thee, as a man 376 doth bear 5375-4 his son, 1121 in all the way 1870 that ye went, 1980-1 until ye came 935-2 into this place. 4725

1:32 Yet in this thing 1697 ye did not believe 539-56 the LORD 3068 your God, 430

1:33 Who went 1980-6 in the way 1870 before 6440 you, to search 8446-2 you out a place 4725 to pitch your tents 2583-2 [in], in fire 784 by night, 3915 to shew 7200-53 you by what way 1870 ye should go, 3212-4 and in a cloud 6051 by day. 3119

1:34 And the LORD 3068 heard 8085-4 the voice 6963 of your words, 1697 and was wroth, 7107-4 and sware, 7650-11 saying, 559-2

1:35 Surely there shall not one 376 of these men 582 of this evil 7451 generation 1755 see 7200-4 that good 2896 land, 776 which I sware 7650-8 to give 5414-2 unto your fathers, 1

1:36 Save 2108 Caleb 3612 the son 1121 of Jephunneh; 3312 he shall see 7200-4 it, and to him will I give 5414-4 the land 776 that he hath trodden 1869-1 upon, and to his children, 1121 because 834 he hath wholly 4390-14 followed 310 the LORD. 3068

1:37 Also the LORD 3068 was angry 599-98 with me for your sakes, 1558 saying, 559-2 Thou also shalt not go in 935-4 thither. 8033

1:38 [But] Joshua 3091 the son 1121 of Nun, 5126 which standeth 5975-6 before 6440 thee, he shall go in 935-4 thither: encourage 2388-16 him: for he shall cause Israel 3478 to inherit 5157-55 it.

1:39 Moreover your little ones, 2945 which ye said 559-1 should be a prey, 957 and your children, 1121 which in that day 3117 had no knowledge 3045-1 between good 2896 and evil, 7451 they shall go in 935-4 thither, and unto them will I give 5414-4 it, and they shall possess 3423-4 it.

1:40 But [as for] you, turn 6437-3 you, and take your journey 5265-3 into the wilderness 4057 by the way 1870 of the Red 5488 sea. 3220

1:41 Then ye answered 6030-4 and said 559-4 unto me, We have sinned 2398-1 against the LORD, 3068 we will go up 5927-4 and fight, 3898-8 according to all that the LORD 3068 our God 430 commanded 6680-14 us. And when ye had girded 2296-4 on every man 376 his weapons 3627 of war, 4421 ye were ready 1951-55 to go up 5927-2 into the hill. 2022

1:42 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto me, Say 559-3 unto them, Go not up, 5927-4 neither fight; 3898-11 for I [am] not among 7130 you; lest ye be smitten 5062-11 before 6440 your enemies. 341-6

1:43 So I spake 1696-17 unto you; and ye would not hear, 8085-1 but rebelled 4784-55 against the commandment 6310 of the LORD, 3068 and went presumptuously 2102-55 up 5927-4 into the hill. 2022

1:44 And the Amorites, 567 which dwelt 3427-6 in that mountain, 2022 came out 3318-4 against 7125-2 you, and chased 7291-4 you, as bees 1682 do, 6213-4 and destroyed 3807-55 you in Seir, 8165 [even] unto Hormah. 2767

1:45 And ye returned 7725-4 and wept 1058-4 before 6440 the LORD; 3068 but the LORD 3068 would not hearken 8085-1 to your voice, 6963 nor give ear 238-52 unto you.

1:46 So ye abode 3427-4 in Kadesh 6946 many 7227 days, 3117 according unto the days 3117 that ye abode 3427-1 [there].

2:1 Then we turned, 6437-4 and took our journey 5265-4 into the wilderness 4057 by the way 1870 of the Red 5488 sea, 3220 as the LORD 3068 spake 1696-14 unto me: and we compassed 5437-4 mount 2022 Seir 8165 many 7227 days. 3117

2:2 And the LORD 3068 spake 559-4 unto me, saying, 559-2

2:3 Ye have compassed 5437-2 this mountain 2022 long enough: 7227 turn 6437-3 you northward. 6828

2:4 And command 6680-16 thou the people, 5971 saying, 559-2 Ye [are] to pass through 5674-6 the coast 1366 of your brethren 251 the children 1121 of Esau, 6215 which dwell 3427-6 in Seir; 8165 and they shall be afraid 3372-4 of you: take ye good 3966 heed 8104-8 unto yourselves therefore:

2:5 Meddle 1624-101 not with them; for I will not give 5414-4 you of their land, 776 no, not so much as a foot 7272 breadth; 4096 3709 because I have given 5414-1 mount 2022 Seir 8165 unto Esau 6215 [for] a possession. 3425

2:6 Ye shall buy 7666-4 meat 400 of them for money, 3701 that ye may eat; 398-1 and ye shall also buy 3739-4 water 4325 of them for money, 3701 that ye may drink. 8354-1

2:7 For the LORD 3068 thy God 430 hath blessed 1288-14 thee in all the works 4639 of thy hand: 3027 he knoweth 3045-1 thy walking 3212-2 through this great 1419 wilderness: 4057 these forty 705 years 8141 the LORD 3068 thy God 430 [hath been] with thee; thou hast lacked 2637-1 nothing. 1697

2:8 And when we passed by 5674-4 from our brethren 251 the children 1121 of Esau, 6215 which dwelt 3427-6 in Seir, 8165 through the way 1870 of the plain 6160 from Elath, 359 and from Eziongaber, 6100 we turned 6437-4 and passed by 5674-4 the way 1870 of the wilderness 4057 of Moab. 4124

2:9 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto me, Distress 6696-4 not the Moabites, 4124 neither contend 1624-101 with them in battle: 4421 for I will not give 5414-4 thee of their land 776 [for] a possession; 3425 because I have given 5414-1 Ar 6144 unto the children 1121 of Lot 3876 [for] a possession. 3425

2:10 The Emims 368 dwelt 3427-1 therein in times past, 6440 a people 5971 great, 1419 and many, 7227 and tall, 7311-6 as the Anakims; 6062

2:11 Which 1992 also were accounted 2803-11 giants, 7497 as the Anakims; 6062 but the Moabites 4125 call 7121-4 them Emims. 368

2:12 The Horims 2752|2753 also dwelt 3427-1 in Seir 8165 beforetime; 6440 but the children 1121 of Esau 6215 succeeded 3423-4 them, when they had destroyed 8045-55 them from before 6440 them, and dwelt 3427-4 in their stead; as Israel 3478 did 6213-1 unto the land 776 of his possession, 3425 which the LORD 3068 gave 5414-1 unto them.

2:13 Now rise up, 6965-3 [said I], and get you over 5674-3 the brook 5158 Zered. 2218 And we went over 5674-4 the brook 5158 Zered. 2218

2:14 And the space 3117 in which we came 1980-1 from Kadeshbarnea, 6947 until we were come over 5674-1 the brook 5158 Zered, 2218 [was] thirty 7970 and eight 8083 years; 8141 until all the generation 1755 of the men 582 of war 4421 were wasted 8552-2 out from among 7130 the host, 4264 as the LORD 3068 sware 7650-8 unto them.

2:15 For indeed the hand 3027 of the LORD 3068 was against them, to destroy 2000-2 them from among 7130 the host, 4264 until they were consumed. 8552-2

2:16 So it came to pass, when all the men 582 of war 4421 were consumed 8552-1 and dead 4191-2 from among 7130 the people, 5971

2:17 That the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto me, saying, 559-2

2:18 Thou art to pass over 5674-6 through Ar, 6144 the coast 1366 of Moab, 4124 this day: 3117

2:19 And [when] thou comest nigh 7126-1 over against 4136 the children 1121 of Ammon, 5983 distress 6696-4 them not, nor meddle 1624-101 with them: for I will not give 5414-4 thee of the land 776 of the children 1121 of Ammon 5983 [any] possession; 3425 because I have given 5414-1 it unto the children 1121 of Lot 3876 [for] a possession. 3425

2:20 (That also was accounted 2803-11 a land 776 of giants: 7497 giants 7497 dwelt 3427-1 therein in old time; 6440 and the Ammonites 5984 call 7121-4 them Zamzummims; 2157

2:21 A people 5971 great, 1419 and many, 7227 and tall, 7311-6 as the Anakims; 6062 but the LORD 3068 destroyed 8045-55 them before 6440 them; and they succeeded 3423-4 them, and dwelt 3427-4 in their stead:

2:22 As he did 6213-1 to the children 1121 of Esau, 6215 which dwelt 3427-6 in Seir, 8165 when he destroyed 8045-52 the Horims 2752|2753 from before 6440 them; and they succeeded 3423-4 them, and dwelt 3427-4 in their stead even unto this day: 3117

2:23 And the Avims 5761 which dwelt 3427-6 in Hazerim, 2699 [even] unto Azzah, 5804 the Caphtorims, 3732 which came forth 3318-6 out of Caphtor, 3731 destroyed 8045-52 them, and dwelt 3427-4 in their stead.)

2:24 Rise ye up, 6965-3 take your journey, 5265-3 and pass over 5674-3 the river 5158 Arnon: 769 behold, 7200-3 I have given 5414-1 into thine hand 3027 Sihon 5511 the Amorite, 567 king 4428 of Heshbon, 2809 and his land: 776 begin 2490-54 to possess 3423-3 [it], and contend 1624-100 with him in battle. 4421

2:25 This day 3117 will I begin 2490-55 to put 5414-2 the dread 6343 of thee and the fear 3374 of thee upon 6440 the nations 5971 [that are] under the whole heaven, 8064 who shall hear 8085-4 report 8088 of thee, and shall tremble, 7264-1 and be in anguish 2342-1 because of 6440 thee.

2:26 And I sent 7971-4 messengers 4397 out of the wilderness 4057 of Kedemoth 6932 unto Sihon 5511 king 4428 of Heshbon 2809 with words 1697 of peace, 7965 saying, 559-2

2:27 Let me pass 5674-4 through thy land: 776 I will go 3212-4 along by the high way, 1870 1870 I will neither turn 5493-4 unto the right hand 3225 nor to the left. 8040

2:28 Thou shalt sell 7666-55 me meat 400 for money, 3701 that I may eat; 398-1 and give 5414-4 me water 4325 for money, 3701 that I may drink: 8354-1 only I will pass 5674-4 through on my feet; 7272

2:29 (As the children 1121 of Esau 6215 which dwell 3427-6 in Seir, 8165 and the Moabites 4125 which dwell 3427-6 in Ar, 6144 did 6213-1 unto me;) until I shall pass over 5674-4 Jordan 3383 into the land 776 which the LORD 3068 our God 430 giveth 5414-6 us.

2:30 But Sihon 5511 king 4428 of Heshbon 2809 would 14-1 not let us pass 5674-53 by him: for the LORD 3068 thy God 430 hardened 7185-52 his spirit, 7307 and made his heart 3824 obstinate, 553-14 that he might deliver 5414-2 him into thy hand, 3027 as [appeareth] this day. 3117

2:31 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto me, Behold, 7200-3 I have begun 2490-52 to give 5414-2 Sihon 5511 and his land 776 before 6440 thee: begin 2490-54 to possess, 3423-3 that thou mayest inherit 3423-2 his land. 776

2:32 Then Sihon 5511 came out 3318-4 against 7125-2 us, he and all his people, 5971 to fight 4421 at Jahaz. 3096

2:33 And the LORD 3068 our God 430 delivered 5414-4 him before 6440 us; and we smote 5221-55 him, and his sons, 1121 and all his people. 5971

2:34 And we took 3920-4 all his cities 5892 at that time, 6256 and utterly destroyed 2763-55 the men, 4962 and the women, 802 and the little ones, 2945 of every city, 5892 we left 7604-52 none to remain: 8300

2:35 Only the cattle 929 we took for a prey 962-1 unto ourselves, and the spoil 7998 of the cities 5892 which we took. 3920-1

2:36 From Aroer, 6177 which [is] by the brink 8193 of the river 5158 of Arnon, 769 and [from] the city 5892 that [is] by the river, 5158 even unto Gilead, 1568 there was not one city 7151 too strong 7682-1 for us: the LORD 3068 our God 430 delivered 5414-1 all unto us: 6440

2:37 Only unto the land 776 of the children 1121 of Ammon 5983 thou camest 7126-1 not, [nor] unto any place 3027 of the river 5158 Jabbok, 2999 nor unto the cities 5892 in the mountains, 2022 nor unto whatsoever the LORD 3068 our God 430 forbad 6680-14 us.

3:1 Then we turned, 6437-4 and went up 5927-4 the way 1870 to Bashan: 1316 and Og 5747 the king 4428 of Bashan 1316 came out 3318-4 against 7125-2 us, he and all his people, 5971 to battle 4421 at Edrei. 154

3:2 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto me, Fear 3372-4 him not: for I will deliver 5414-1 him, and all his people, 5971 and his land, 776 into thy hand; 3027 and thou shalt do 6213-1 unto him as thou didst 6213-1 unto Sihon 5511 king 4428 of the Amorites, 567 which dwelt 3427-6 at Heshbon. 2809

3:3 So the LORD 3068 our God 430 delivered 5414-4 into our hands 3027 Og 5747 also, the king 4428 of Bashan, 1316 and all his people: 5971 and we smote 5221-55 him until none was left 7604-52 to him remaining. 8300

3:4 And we took 3920-4 all his cities 5892 at that time, 6256 there was not a city 7151 which we took 3947-1 not from them, threescore 8346 cities, 5892 all the region 2256 of Argob, 709 the kingdom 4467 of Og 5747 in Bashan. 1316

3:5 All these cities 5892 [were] fenced 1219-7 with high 1364 walls, 2346 gates, 1817 and bars; 1280 beside unwalled 6521 towns 5892 a great 3966 many. 7235-53

3:6 And we utterly destroyed 2763-55 them, as we did 6213-1 unto Sihon 5511 king 4428 of Heshbon, 2809 utterly destroying 2763-53 the men, 4962 women, 802 and children, 2945 of every city. 5892

3:7 But all the cattle, 929 and the spoil 7998 of the cities, 5892 we took for a prey 962-1 to ourselves.

3:8 And we took 3947-4 at that time 6256 out of the hand 3027 of the two 8147 kings 4428 of the Amorites 567 the land 776 that [was] on this side 5676 Jordan, 3383 from the river 5158 of Arnon 769 unto mount 2022 Hermon; 2768

3:9 ([Which] Hermon 2768 the Sidonians 6722 call 7121-4 Sirion; 8303 and the Amorites 567 call 7121-4 it Shenir;) 8149

3:10 All the cities 5892 of the plain, 4334 and all Gilead, 1568 and all Bashan, 1316 unto Salchah 5548 and Edrei, 154 cities 5892 of the kingdom 4467 of Og 5747 in Bashan. 1316

3:11 For only Og 5747 king 4428 of Bashan 1316 remained 7604-8 of the remnant 3499 of giants; 7497 behold, his bedstead 6210 [was] a bedstead 6210 of iron; 1270 [is] it not 3808 in Rabbath 7237 of the children 1121 of Ammon? 5983 nine 8672 cubits 520 [was] the length 753 thereof, and four 702 cubits 520 the breadth 7341 of it, after the cubit 520 of a man. 376

3:12 And this land, 776 [which] we possessed 3423-1 at that time, 6256 from Aroer, 6177 which [is] by the river 5158 Arnon, 769 and half 2677 mount 2022 Gilead, 1568 and the cities 5892 thereof, gave 5414-1 I unto the Reubenites 7206 and to the Gadites. 1425

3:13 And the rest 3499 of Gilead, 1568 and all Bashan, 1316 [being] the kingdom 4467 of Og, 5747 gave 5414-1 I unto the half 2677 tribe 7626 of Manasseh; 4519 all the region 2256 of Argob, 709 with all Bashan, 1316 which 1931 was called 7121-11 the land 776 of giants. 7497

3:14 Jair 2971 the son 1121 of Manasseh 4519 took 3947-1 all the country 2256 of Argob 709 unto the coasts 1366 of Geshuri 1651 and Maachathi; 4602 and called 7121-4 them after his own name, 8034 Bashanhavothjair, 1316|2334|2971 unto this day. 3117

3:15 And I gave 5414-1 Gilead 1568 unto Machir. 4353

3:16 And unto the Reubenites 7206 and unto the Gadites 1425 I gave 5414-1 from Gilead 1568 even unto the river 5158 Arnon 769 half 8432 the valley, 5158 and the border 1366 even unto the river 5158 Jabbok, 2999 [which is] the border 1366 of the children 1121 of Ammon; 5983

3:17 The plain 6160 also, and Jordan, 3383 and the coast 1366 [thereof], from Chinnereth 3672 even unto the sea 3220 of the plain, 6160 [even] the salt 4417 sea, 3220 under Ashdothpisgah 794|6449|798 eastward. 4217

3:18 And I commanded 6680-17 you at that time, 6256 saying, 559-2 The LORD 3068 your God 430 hath given 5414-1 you this land 776 to possess 3423-2 it: ye shall pass over 5674-4 armed 2502-7 before 6440 your brethren 251 the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 all [that are] meet 1121 for the war. 2428

3:19 But your wives, 802 and your little ones, 2945 and your cattle, 4735 ([for] I know 3045-1 that ye have much 7227 cattle,) 4735 shall abide 3427-4 in your cities 5892 which I have given 5414-1 you;

3:20 Until the LORD 3068 have given rest 5117-55 unto your brethren, 251 as well as unto you, and [until] they also possess 3423-1 the land 776 which the LORD 3068 your God 430 hath given 5414-6 them beyond 5676 Jordan: 3383 and [then] shall ye return 7725-1 every man 376 unto his possession, 3425 which I have given 5414-1 you.

3:21 And I commanded 6680-14 Joshua 3091 at that time, 6256 saying, 559-2 Thine eyes 5869 have seen 7200-6 all that the LORD 3068 your God 430 hath done 6213-1 unto these two 8147 kings: 4428 so shall the LORD 3068 do 6213-4 unto all the kingdoms 4467 whither thou passest. 5674-6

3:22 Ye shall not fear 3372-4 them: for the LORD 3068 your God 430 he shall fight 3898-12 for you.

3:23 And I besought 2603-101 the LORD 3068 at that time, 6256 saying, 559-2

3:24 O Lord 136 GOD, 3069 thou hast begun 2490-52 to shew 7200-53 thy servant 5650 thy greatness, 1433 and thy mighty 2389 hand: 3027 for what God 410 [is there] in heaven 8064 or in earth, 776 that can do 6213-4 according to thy works, 4639 and according to thy might? 1369

3:25 I pray thee, let me go over, 5674-4 and see 7200-4 the good 2896 land 776 that [is] beyond 5676 Jordan, 3383 that goodly 2896 mountain, 2022 and Lebanon. 3844

3:26 But the LORD 3068 was wroth 5674-101 with me for your sakes, and would not hear 8085-1 me: and the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto me, Let it suffice 7227 thee; speak 1696-15 no more 3254-55 unto me of this matter. 1697

3:27 Get thee up 5927-3 into the top 7218 of Pisgah, 6449 and lift up 5375-3 thine eyes 5869 westward, 3220 and northward, 6828 and southward, 8486 and eastward, 4217 and behold 7200-3 [it] with thine eyes: 5869 for thou shalt not go over 5674-4 this Jordan. 3383

3:28 But charge 6680-16 Joshua, 3091 and encourage 2388-16 him, and strengthen 553-16 him: for he shall go over 5674-4 before 6440 this people, 5971 and he shall cause them to inherit 5157-55 the land 776 which thou shalt see. 7200-4

3:29 So we abode 3427-4 in the valley 1516 over against 4136 Bethpeor. 1047

4:1 Now therefore hearken, 8085-3 O Israel, 3478 unto the statutes 2706 and unto the judgments, 4941 which I teach 3925-18 you, for to do 6213-2 [them], that ye may live, 2421-4 and go in 935-1 and possess 3423-1 the land 776 which the LORD 3068 God 430 of your fathers 1 giveth 5414-6 you.

4:2 Ye shall not add 3254-55 unto the word 1697 which I command 6680-18 you, neither shall ye diminish 1639-4 [ought] from it, that ye may keep 8104-2 the commandments 4687 of the LORD 3068 your God 430 which I command 6680-18 you.

4:3 Your eyes 5869 have seen 7200-6 what the LORD 3068 did 6213-1 because of Baalpeor: 1187 for all the men 376 that followed 310 1980-1 Baalpeor, 1187 the LORD 3068 thy God 430 hath destroyed 8045-52 them from among 7130 you.

4:4 But ye that did cleave 1695 unto the LORD 3068 your God 430 [are] alive 2416 every one of you this day. 3117

4:5 Behold, 7200-3 I have taught 3925-14 you statutes 2706 and judgments, 4941 even as 834 the LORD 3068 my God 430 commanded 6680-14 me, that ye should do 6213-2 so in 7130 the land 776 whither ye go 935-6 to possess 3423-2 it.

4:6 Keep 8104-1 therefore and do 6213-1 [them]; for this [is] your wisdom 2451 and your understanding 998 in the sight 5869 of the nations, 5971 which shall hear 8085-4 all these statutes, 2706 and say, 559-1 Surely this great 1419 nation 1471 [is] a wise 2450 and understanding 995-12 people. 5971

4:7 For what nation 1471 [is there so] great, 1419 who [hath] God 430 [so] nigh 7138 unto them, as the LORD 3068 our God 430 [is] in all [things that] we call 7121-2 upon him [for]?

4:8 And what nation 1471 [is there so] great, 1419 that hath statutes 2706 and judgments 4941 [so] righteous 6662 as all this law, 8451 which I set 5414-6 before 6440 you this day? 3117

4:9 Only take heed 8104-10 to thyself, and keep 8104-3 thy soul 5315 diligently, 3966 lest thou forget 7911-4 the things 1697 which thine eyes 5869 have seen, 7200-1 and lest they depart 5493-4 from thy heart 3824 all the days 3117 of thy life: 2416 but teach 3045-52 them thy sons, 1121 and thy sons' 1121 sons; 1121

4:10 [Specially] the day 3117 that thou stoodest 5975-1 before 6440 the LORD 3068 thy God 430 in Horeb, 2722 when the LORD 3068 said 559-2 unto me, Gather me the people 5971 together, 6950-54 and I will make them hear 8085-55 my words, 1697 that they may learn 3925-4 to fear 3372-2 me all the days 3117 that they shall live 2416 upon the earth, 127 and [that] they may teach 3925-17 their children. 1121

4:11 And ye came near 7126-4 and stood 5975-4 under the mountain; 2022 and the mountain 2022 burned 1197-6 with fire 784 unto the midst 3820 of heaven, 8064 with darkness, 2822 clouds, 6051 and thick darkness. 6205

4:12 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto you out of the midst 8432 of the fire: 784 ye heard 8085-6 the voice 6963 of the words, 1697 but saw 7200-6 no similitude; 8544 only 2108 [ye heard] a voice. 6963

4:13 And he declared 5046-55 unto you his covenant, 1285 which he commanded 6680-14 you to perform, 6213-2 [even] ten 6235 commandments; 1697 and he wrote 3789-4 them upon two 8147 tables 3871 of stone. 68

4:14 And the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 me at that time 6256 to teach 3925-15 you statutes 2706 and judgments, 4941 that ye might do 6213-2 them in the land 776 whither ye go over 5674-6 to possess 3423-2 it.

4:15 Take ye therefore good 3966 heed 8104-8 unto yourselves; 5315 for ye saw 7200-1 no manner of similitude 8544 on the day 3117 [that] the LORD 3068 spake 1696-15 unto you in Horeb 2722 out of the midst 8432 of the fire: 784

4:16 Lest ye corrupt 7843-55 [yourselves], and make 6213-1 you a graven image, 6459 the similitude 8544 of any figure, 5566 the likeness 8403 of male 2145 or female, 5347

4:17 The likeness 8403 of any beast 929 that [is] on the earth, 776 the likeness 8403 of any winged 3671 fowl 6833 that flieth 5774-4 in the air, 8064

4:18 The likeness 8403 of any thing that creepeth 7430-6 on the ground, 127 the likeness 8403 of any fish 1710 that [is] in the waters 4325 beneath 8478 the earth: 776

4:19 And lest thou lift up 5375-4 thine eyes 5869 unto heaven, 8064 and when thou seest 7200-1 the sun, 8121 and the moon, 3394 and the stars, 3556 [even] all the host 6635 of heaven, 8064 shouldest be driven 5080-8 to worship 7812-98 them, and serve 5647-1 them, which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 hath divided 2505-1 unto all nations 5971 under the whole heaven. 8064

4:20 But the LORD 3068 hath taken 3947-1 you, and brought you forth 3318-55 out of the iron 1270 furnace, 3564 [even] out of Egypt, 4714 to be unto him a people 5971 of inheritance, 5159 as [ye are] this day. 3117

4:21 Furthermore the LORD 3068 was angry 599-98 with me for your sakes, 1697 and sware 7650-11 that I should not go over 5674-2 Jordan, 3383 and that I should not go in 935-2 unto that good 2896 land, 776 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 giveth 5414-6 thee [for] an inheritance: 5159

4:22 But I must die 4191-5 in this land, 776 I must not go over 5674-6 Jordan: 3383 but ye shall go over, 5674-6 and possess 3423-1 that good 2896 land. 776

4:23 Take heed 8104-10 unto yourselves, lest ye forget 7911-4 the covenant 1285 of the LORD 3068 your God, 430 which he made 3772-1 with you, and make 6213-1 you a graven image, 6459 [or] the likeness 8544 of any 3605 [thing], which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 hath forbidden 6680-14 thee.

4:24 For the LORD 3068 thy God 430 [is] a consuming 398-6 fire, 784 [even] a jealous 7067 God. 410

4:25 When thou shalt beget 3205-55 children, 1121 and children's 1121 children, 1121 and ye shall have remained long 3462-8 in the land, 776 and shall corrupt 7843-52 [yourselves], and make 6213-1 a graven image, 6459 [or] the likeness 8544 of any [thing], and shall do 6213-1 evil 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 to provoke him to anger: 3707-53

4:26 I call heaven 8064 and earth 776 to witness 5749-52 against you this day, 3117 that ye shall soon 4118 utterly 6-2 perish 6-4 from off the land 776 whereunto ye go over 5674-6 Jordan 3383 to possess 3423-2 it; ye shall not prolong 748-55 [your] days 3117 upon it, but shall utterly 8045-9 be destroyed. 8045-11

4:27 And the LORD 3068 shall scatter 6327-52 you among the nations, 5971 and ye shall be left 7604-8 few 4962 in number 4557 among the heathen, 1471 whither the LORD 3068 shall lead 5090-17 you.

4:28 And there ye shall serve 5647-1 gods, 430 the work 4639 of men's 120 hands, 3027 wood 6086 and stone, 68 which neither see, 7200-4 nor hear, 8085-4 nor eat, 398-4 nor smell. 7306-55

4:29 But if from thence thou shalt seek 1245-14 the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 thou shalt find 4672-1 [him], if thou seek 1875-4 him with all thy heart 3824 and with all thy soul. 5315

4:30 When thou art in tribulation, 6862 and all these things 1697 are come upon 4672-1 thee, [even] in the latter 319 days, 3117 if thou turn 7725-1 to the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 and shalt be obedient 8085-1 unto his voice; 6963

4:31 (For the LORD 3068 thy God 430 [is] a merciful 7349 God;) 410 he will not forsake 7503-55 thee, neither destroy 7843-55 thee, nor forget 7911-4 the covenant 1285 of thy fathers 1 which he sware 7650-8 unto them.

4:32 For ask 7592-3 now of the days 3117 that are past, 7223 which were before 6440 thee, since the day 3117 that God 430 created 1254-1 man 120 upon the earth, 776 and [ask] from the one side 7097 of heaven 8064 unto the other, 7097 8064 whether there hath been 1961-8 [any such thing] as this great 1419 thing 1697 [is], or hath been heard 8085-8 like it?

4:33 Did [ever] people 5971 hear 8085-1 the voice 6963 of God 430 speaking 1696-18 out of the midst 8432 of the fire, 784 as thou hast heard, 8085-1 and live? 2421-4

4:34 Or hath God 430 assayed 5254-14 to go 935-2 [and] take 3947-2 him a nation 1471 from the midst 7130 of [another] nation, 1471 by temptations, 4531 by signs, 226 and by wonders, 4159 and by war, 4421 and by a mighty 2389 hand, 3027 and by a stretched out 5186-7 arm, 2220 and by great 1419 terrors, 4172 according to all that the LORD 3068 your God 430 did 6213-1 for you in Egypt 4714 before your eyes? 5869

4:35 Unto thee it was shewed, 7200-90 that thou mightest know 3045-2 that the LORD 3068 he [is] God; 430 [there is] none else 5750 beside him. 905

4:36 Out of heaven 8064 he made thee to hear 8085-52 his voice, 6963 that he might instruct 3256-15 thee: and upon earth 776 he shewed 7200-52 thee his great 1419 fire; 784 and thou heardest 8085-1 his words 1697 out of the midst 8432 of the fire. 784

4:37 And because he loved 157-1 thy fathers, 1 therefore he chose 977-4 their seed 2233 after 310 them, and brought thee out 3318-55 in his sight 6440 with his mighty 1419 power 3581 out of Egypt; 4714

4:38 To drive out 3423-53 nations 1471 from before 6440 thee greater 1419 and mightier 6099 than thou [art], to bring thee in, 935-53 to give 5414-2 thee their land 776 [for] an inheritance, 5159 as [it is] this day. 3117

4:39 Know 3045-1 therefore this day, 3117 and consider 7725-52 [it] in thine heart, 3824 that the LORD 3068 he [is] God 430 in heaven 8064 above, 4605 and upon the earth 776 beneath: [there is] none else.

4:40 Thou shalt keep 8104-1 therefore his statutes, 2706 and his commandments, 4687 which I command 6680-18 thee this day, 3117 that it may go well 3190-4 with thee, and with thy children 1121 after 310 thee, and that thou mayest prolong 748-55 [thy] days 3117 upon the earth, 127 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 giveth 5414-6 thee, for ever. 3605 3117

4:41 Then Moses 4872 severed 914-55 three 7969 cities 5892 on this side 5676 Jordan 3383 toward the sunrising; 8121 4217

4:42 That the slayer 7523-6 might flee 5127-2 thither, which should kill 7523-4 his neighbour 7453 unawares, 1097 1847 and hated 8130-6 him not in times past; 8543 8032 and that fleeing 5127-1 unto one 259 of these 411 cities 5892 he might live: 2425-1

4:43 [Namely], Bezer 1221 in the wilderness, 4057 in the plain 4334 country, 776 of the Reubenites; 7206 and Ramoth 7216 in Gilead, 1568 of the Gadites; 1425 and Golan 1474 in Bashan, 1316 of the Manassites. 4520

4:44 And this [is] the law 8451 which Moses 4872 set 7760-1 before 6440 the children 1121 of Israel: 3478

4:45 These [are] the testimonies, 5713 and the statutes, 2706 and the judgments, 4941 which Moses 4872 spake 1696-14 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 after they came forth 3318-2 out of Egypt, 4714

4:46 On this side 5676 Jordan, 3383 in the valley 1516 over against 4136 Bethpeor, 1047 in the land 776 of Sihon 5511 king 4428 of the Amorites, 567 who dwelt 3427-6 at Heshbon, 2809 whom Moses 4872 and the children 1121 of Israel 3478 smote, 5221-52 after they were come forth 3318-2 out of Egypt: 4714

4:47 And they possessed 3423-4 his land, 776 and the land 776 of Og 5747 king 4428 of Bashan, 1316 two 8147 kings 4428 of the Amorites, 567 which [were] on this side 5676 Jordan 3383 toward the sunrising; 4217 8121

4:48 From Aroer, 6177 which [is] by the bank 8193 of the river 5158 Arnon, 769 even unto mount 2022 Sion, 7865 which [is] Hermon, 2768

4:49 And all the plain 6160 on this side 5676 Jordan 3383 eastward, 4217 even unto the sea 3220 of the plain, 6160 under the springs 794 of Pisgah. 6449

5:1 And Moses 4872 called 7121-4 all Israel, 3478 and said 559-4 unto them, Hear, 8085-3 O Israel, 3478 the statutes 2706 and judgments 4941 which I speak 1696-6 in your ears 241 this day, 3117 that ye may learn 3925-1 them, and keep, 8104-1 and do 6213-2 them.

5:2 The LORD 3068 our God 430 made 3772-1 a covenant 1285 with us in Horeb. 2722

5:3 The LORD 3068 made 3772-1 not this covenant 1285 with our fathers, 1 but with us, [even] us, 587 who 428 [are] all of us here alive 2416 this day. 3117

5:4 The LORD 3068 talked 1696-14 with you face 6440 to face 6440 in the mount 2022 out of the midst 8432 of the fire, 784

5:5 (I stood 5975-6 between the LORD 3068 and you at that time, 6256 to shew 5046-53 you the word 1697 of the LORD: 3068 for ye were afraid 3372-1 by reason 6440 of the fire, 784 and went not up 5927-1 into the mount;) 2022 saying, 559-2

5:6 I [am] the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 which brought thee out 3318-52 of the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 from the house 1004 of bondage. 5650

5:7 Thou shalt have none other 312 gods 430 before 6440 me.

5:8 Thou shalt not make 6213-4 thee [any] graven image, 6459 [or] any likeness 8544 [of any thing] that [is] in heaven 8064 above, 4605 or that [is] in the earth 776 beneath, or that [is] in the waters 4325 beneath the earth: 776

5:9 Thou shalt not bow down 7812-101 thyself unto them, nor serve 5647-93 them: for I the LORD 3068 thy God 430 [am] a jealous 7067 God, 410 visiting 6485-6 the iniquity 5771 of the fathers 1 upon the children 1121 unto the third 8029 and fourth 7256 [generation] of them that hate 8130-6 me,

5:10 And shewing 6213-6 mercy 2617 unto thousands 505 of them that love 157-6 me and keep 8104-6 my commandments. 4687

5:11 Thou shalt not take 5375-4 the name 8034 of the LORD 3068 thy God 430 in vain: 7723 for the LORD 3068 will not hold [him] guiltless 5352-17 that taketh 5375-4 his name 8034 in vain. 7723

5:12 Keep 8104-2 the sabbath 7676 day 3117 to sanctify 6942-15 it, as the LORD 3068 thy God 430 hath commanded 6680-14 thee.

5:13 Six 8337 days 3117 thou shalt labour, 5647-4 and do 6213-1 all thy work: 4399

5:14 But the seventh 7637 day 3117 [is] the sabbath 7676 of the LORD 3068 thy God: 430 [in it] thou shalt not do 6213-4 any work, 4399 thou, nor thy son, 1121 nor thy daughter, 1323 nor thy manservant, 5650 nor thy maidservant, 519 nor thine ox, 7794 nor thine ass, 2543 nor any of thy cattle, 929 nor thy stranger 1616 that [is] within thy gates; 8179 that thy manservant 5650 and thy maidservant 519 may rest 5117-4 as well as thou.

5:15 And remember 2142-1 that thou wast a servant 5650 in the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 and [that] the LORD 3068 thy God 430 brought thee out 3318-55 thence through a mighty 2389 hand 3027 and by a stretched out 5186-7 arm: 2220 therefore the LORD 3068 thy God 430 commanded 6680-14 thee to keep 6213-2 the sabbath 7676 day. 3117

5:16 Honour 3513-16 thy father 1 and thy mother, 517 as the LORD 3068 thy God 430 hath commanded 6680-14 thee; that thy days 3117 may be prolonged, 748-55 and that it may go well 3190-4 with thee, in the land 127 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 giveth 5414-6 thee.

5:17 Thou shalt not kill. 7523-4

5:18 Neither shalt thou commit adultery. 5003-4

5:19 Neither shalt thou steal. 1589-4

5:20 Neither shalt thou bear 6030-4 false 7723 witness 5707 against thy neighbour. 7453

5:21 Neither shalt thou desire 2530-4 thy neighbour's 7453 wife, 802 neither shalt thou covet 183-101 thy neighbour's 7453 house, 1004 his field, 7704 or his manservant, 5650 or his maidservant, 519 his ox, 7794 or his ass, 2543 or any [thing] that [is] thy neighbour's. 7453

5:22 These words 1697 the LORD 3068 spake 1696-14 unto all your assembly 6951 in the mount 2022 out of the midst 8432 of the fire, 784 of the cloud, 6051 and of the thick darkness, 6205 with a great 1419 voice: 6963 and he added 3254-1 no more. And he wrote 3789-4 them in two 8147 tables 3871 of stone, 68 and delivered 5414-4 them unto me.

5:23 And it came to pass, when ye heard 8085-2 the voice 6963 out of the midst 8432 of the darkness, 2822 (for the mountain 2022 did burn 1197-6 with fire,) 784 that ye came near 7126-4 unto me, [even] all the heads 7218 of your tribes, 7626 and your elders; 2205

5:24 And ye said, 559-4 Behold, the LORD 3068 our God 430 hath shewed 7200-52 us his glory 3519 and his greatness, 1433 and we have heard 8085-1 his voice 6963 out of the midst 8432 of the fire: 784 we have seen 7200-1 this day 3117 that God 430 doth talk 1696-17 with man, 120 and he liveth. 2425-1

5:25 Now therefore why should we die? 4191-4 for this great 1419 fire 784 will consume 398-4 us: if we hear 8085-2 the voice 6963 of the LORD 3068 our God 430 any more, 3254-6 then we shall die. 4191-1

5:26 For who [is there of] all flesh, 1320 that hath heard 8085-1 the voice 6963 of the living 2416 God 430 speaking 1696-18 out of the midst 8432 of the fire, 784 as we [have], and lived? 2421-4

5:27 Go thou near, 7126-3 and hear 8085-3 all that the LORD 3068 our God 430 shall say: 559-4 and speak 1696-17 thou unto us all that the LORD 3068 our God 430 shall speak 1696-17 unto thee; and we will hear 8085-1 [it], and do 6213-1 [it].

5:28 And the LORD 3068 heard 8085-4 the voice 6963 of your words, 1697 when ye spake 1696-15 unto me; and the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto me, I have heard 8085-1 the voice 6963 of the words 1697 of this people, 5971 which they have spoken 1696-14 unto thee: they have well 3190-52 said all that they have spoken. 1696-14

5:29 O that 4310 5414-4 there were such 2088 an heart 3824 in them, that they would fear 3372-2 me, and keep 8104-2 all my commandments 4687 always, 3605 3117 that it might be well 3190-4 with them, and with their children 1121 for ever! 5769

5:30 Go 3212-3 say 559-3 to them, Get you into your tents 168 again. 7725-3

5:31 But as for thee, stand 5975-3 thou here by me, 5978 and I will speak 1696-17 unto thee all the commandments, 4687 and the statutes, 2706 and the judgments, 4941 which thou shalt teach 3925-17 them, that they may do 6213-1 [them] in the land 776 which I give 5414-6 them to possess 3423-2 it.

5:32 Ye shall observe 8104-1 to do 6213-2 therefore as the LORD 3068 your God 430 hath commanded 6680-14 you: ye shall not turn aside 5493-4 to the right hand 3225 or to the left. 8040

5:33 Ye shall walk 3212-4 in all the ways 1870 which the LORD 3068 your God 430 hath commanded 6680-14 you, that ye may live, 2421-4 and [that it may be] well 2895-1 with you, and [that] ye may prolong 748-52 [your] days 3117 in the land 776 which ye shall possess. 3423-4

6:1 Now these [are] the commandments, 4687 the statutes, 2706 and the judgments, 4941 which the LORD 3068 your God 430 commanded 6680-14 to teach 3925-15 you, that ye might do 6213-2 [them] in the land 776 whither ye go 5674-6 to possess 3423-2 it:

6:2 That thou mightest fear 3372-4 the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 to keep 8104-2 all his statutes 2708 and his commandments, 4687 which I command 6680-18 thee, thou, and thy son, 1121 and thy son's 1121 son, 1121 all the days 3117 of thy life; 2416 and that thy days 3117 may be prolonged. 748-55

6:3 Hear 8085-1 therefore, O Israel, 3478 and observe 8104-1 to do 6213-2 [it]; that it may be well 3190-4 with thee, and that ye may increase 7235-4 mightily, 3966 as the LORD 3068 God 430 of thy fathers 1 hath promised 1696-14 thee, in the land 776 that floweth 2100-6 with milk 2461 and honey. 1706

6:4 Hear, 8085-3 O Israel: 3478 The LORD 3068 our God 430 [is] one 259 LORD: 3068

6:5 And thou shalt love 157-1 the LORD 3068 thy God 430 with all thine heart, 3824 and with all thy soul, 5315 and with all thy might. 3966

6:6 And these words, 1697 which I command 6680-18 thee this day, 3117 shall be in thine heart: 3824

6:7 And thou shalt teach them diligently 8150-14 unto thy children, 1121 and shalt talk 1696-14 of them when thou sittest 3427-2 in thine house, 1004 and when thou walkest 3212-2 by the way, 1870 and when thou liest down, 7901-2 and when thou risest up. 6965-2

6:8 And thou shalt bind 7194-1 them for a sign 226 upon thine hand, 3027 and they shall be as frontlets 2903 between thine eyes. 5869

6:9 And thou shalt write 3789-1 them upon the posts 4201 of thy house, 1004 and on thy gates. 8179

6:10 And it shall be, when the LORD 3068 thy God 430 shall have brought 935-55 thee into the land 776 which he sware 7650-8 unto thy fathers, 1 to Abraham, 85 to Isaac, 3327 and to Jacob, 3290 to give 5414-2 thee great 1419 and goodly 2896 cities, 5892 which thou buildedst 1129-1 not,

6:11 And houses 1004 full 4392 of all good 2898 [things], which thou filledst 4390-14 not, and wells 953 digged, 2672-7 which thou diggedst 2672-1 not, vineyards 3754 and olive trees, 2132 which thou plantedst 5193-1 not; when thou shalt have eaten 398-1 and be full; 7646-1

6:12 [Then] beware 8104-10 lest thou forget 7911-4 the LORD, 3068 which brought thee forth 3318-52 out of the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 from the house 1004 of bondage. 5650

6:13 Thou shalt fear 3372-4 the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 and serve 5647-4 him, and shalt swear 7650-11 by his name. 8034

6:14 Ye shall not go 3212-4 after 310 other 312 gods, 430 of the gods 430 of the people 5971 which [are] round about 5439 you;

6:15 (For the LORD 3068 thy God 430 [is] a jealous 7067 God 410 among 7130 you) lest the anger 639 of the LORD 3068 thy God 430 be kindled 2734-4 against thee, and destroy 8045-52 thee from off the face 6440 of the earth. 127

6:16 Ye shall not tempt 5254-17 the LORD 3068 your God, 430 as ye tempted 5254-14 [him] in Massah. 4532

6:17 Ye shall diligently 8104-2 keep 8104-4 the commandments 4687 of the LORD 3068 your God, 430 and his testimonies, 5713 and his statutes, 2706 which he hath commanded 6680-14 thee.

6:18 And thou shalt do 6213-1 [that which is] right 3477 and good 2896 in the sight 5869 of the LORD: 3068 that it may be well 3190-4 with thee, and that thou mayest go in 935-1 and possess 3423-1 the good 2896 land 776 which the LORD 3068 sware 7650-8 unto thy fathers, 1

6:19 To cast out 1920-2 all thine enemies 341-6 from before 6440 thee, as the LORD 3068 hath spoken. 1696-14

6:20 [And] when thy son 1121 asketh 7592-4 thee in time to come, 4279 saying, 559-2 What [mean] the testimonies, 5713 and the statutes, 2706 and the judgments, 4941 which the LORD 3068 our God 430 hath commanded 6680-14 you?

6:21 Then thou shalt say 559-1 unto thy son, 1121 We were Pharaoh's 6547 bondmen 5650 in Egypt; 4714 and the LORD 3068 brought us out 3318-55 of Egypt 4714 with a mighty 2389 hand: 3027

6:22 And the LORD 3068 shewed 5414-4 signs 226 and wonders, 4159 great 1419 and sore, 7451 upon Egypt, 4714 upon Pharaoh, 6547 and upon all his household, 1004 before our eyes: 5869

6:23 And he brought us out 3318-52 from thence, that he might bring 935-53 us in, to give 5414-2 us the land 776 which he sware 7650-8 unto our fathers. 1

6:24 And the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-17 us to do 6213-2 all these statutes, 2706 to fear 3372-2 the LORD 3068 our God, 430 for our good 2896 always, 3117 that he might preserve us alive, 2421-15 as [it is] at this day. 3117

6:25 And it shall be our righteousness, 6666 if we observe 8104-4 to do 6213-2 all these 2063 commandments 4687 before 6440 the LORD 3068 our God, 430 as he hath commanded 6680-14 us.

7:1 When the LORD 3068 thy God 430 shall bring 935-55 thee into the land 776 whither thou goest 935-6 to possess 3423-2 it, and hath cast out 5394-1 many 7227 nations 1471 before 6440 thee, the Hittites, 2850 and the Girgashites, 1622 and the Amorites, 567 and the Canaanites, 3669 and the Perizzites, 6522 and the Hivites, 2340 and the Jebusites, 2983 seven 7651 nations 1471 greater 7227 and mightier 6099 than thou;

7:2 And when the LORD 3068 thy God 430 shall deliver 5414-1 them before 6440 thee; thou shalt smite 5221-52 them, [and] utterly 2763-53 destroy 2763-55 them; thou shalt make 3772-4 no covenant 1285 with them, nor shew mercy 2603-4 unto them:

7:3 Neither shalt thou make marriages 2859-101 with them; thy daughter 1323 thou shalt not give 5414-4 unto his son, 1121 nor his daughter 1323 shalt thou take 3947-4 unto thy son. 1121

7:4 For they will turn away 5493-55 thy son 1121 from following 310 me, that they may serve 5647-1 other 312 gods: 430 so will the anger 639 of the LORD 3068 be kindled 2734-1 against you, and destroy 8045-52 thee suddenly. 4118

7:5 But thus shall ye deal 6213-4 with them; ye shall destroy 5422-4 their altars, 4196 and break down 7665-17 their images, 4676 and cut down 1438-17 their groves, 842 and burn 8313-4 their graven images 6456 with fire. 784

7:6 For thou [art] an holy 6918 people 5971 unto the LORD 3068 thy God: 430 the LORD 3068 thy God 430 hath chosen 977-1 thee to be a special 5459 people 5971 unto himself, above all people 5971 that [are] upon the face 6440 of the earth. 127

7:7 The LORD 3068 did not set his love 2836-1 upon you, nor choose 977-4 you, because ye were more in number 7230 than any people; 5971 for ye [were] the fewest 4592 of all people: 5971

7:8 But because the LORD 3068 loved 160 you, and because he would keep 8104-2 the oath 7621 which he had sworn 7650-8 unto your fathers, 1 hath the LORD 3068 brought you out 3318-52 with a mighty 2389 hand, 3027 and redeemed 6299-4 you out of the house 1004 of bondmen, 5650 from the hand 3027 of Pharaoh 6547 king 4428 of Egypt. 4714

7:9 Know 3045-1 therefore that the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 he [is] God, 430 the faithful 539-12 God, 410 which keepeth 8104-6 covenant 1285 and mercy 2617 with them that love 157-6 him and keep 8104-6 his commandments 4687 to a thousand 505 generations; 1755

7:10 And repayeth 7999-18 them that hate 8130-6 him to their face, 6440 to destroy 6-53 them: he will not be slack 309-17 to him that hateth 8130-6 him, he will repay 7999-17 him to his face. 6440

7:11 Thou shalt therefore keep 8104-1 the commandments, 4687 and the statutes, 2706 and the judgments, 4941 which I command 6680-18 thee this day, 3117 to do 6213-2 them.

7:12 Wherefore it shall come to pass, if 6118 ye hearken 8085-4 to these judgments, 4941 and keep, 8104-1 and do 6213-1 them, that the LORD 3068 thy God 430 shall keep 8104-1 unto thee the covenant 1285 and the mercy 2617 which he sware 7650-8 unto thy fathers: 1

7:13 And he will love 157-1 thee, and bless 1288-14 thee, and multiply 7235-52 thee: he will also bless 1288-14 the fruit 6529 of thy womb, 990 and the fruit 6529 of thy land, 127 thy corn, 1715 and thy wine, 8492 and thine oil, 3323 the increase 7698 of thy kine, 504 and the flocks 6251 of thy sheep, 6629 in the land 127 which he sware 7650-8 unto thy fathers 1 to give 5414-2 thee.

7:14 Thou shalt be blessed 1288-7 above all people: 5971 there shall not be male 6135 or female barren 6135 among you, or among your cattle. 929

7:15 And the LORD 3068 will take away 5493-52 from thee all sickness, 2483 and will put 7760-4 none of the evil 7451 diseases 4064 of Egypt, 4714 which thou knowest, 3045-1 upon thee; but will lay 5414-1 them upon all [them] that hate 8130-6 thee.

7:16 And thou shalt consume 398-1 all the people 5971 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 shall deliver 5414-6 thee; thine eye 5869 shall have no pity 2347-4 upon them: neither shalt thou serve 5647-4 their gods; 430 for that [will be] a snare 4170 unto thee.

7:17 If thou shalt say 559-4 in thine heart, 3824 These nations 1471 [are] more 7227 than I; how 349 can 3201-4 I dispossess 3423-53 them?

7:18 Thou shalt not be afraid 3372-4 of them: [but] shalt well 2142-2 remember 2142-4 what the LORD 3068 thy God 430 did 6213-1 unto Pharaoh, 6547 and unto all Egypt; 4714

7:19 The great 1419 temptations 4531 which thine eyes 5869 saw, 7200-1 and the signs, 226 and the wonders, 4159 and the mighty 2389 hand, 3027 and the stretched out 5186-7 arm, 2220 whereby the LORD 3068 thy God 430 brought thee out: 3318-52 so shall the LORD 3068 thy God 430 do 6213-4 unto all the people 5971 of whom 6440 thou art afraid. 3373

7:20 Moreover the LORD 3068 thy God 430 will send 7971-17 the hornet 6880 among them, until they that are left, 7604-12 and hide 5641-12 themselves from 6440 thee, be destroyed. 6-2

7:21 Thou shalt not be affrighted 6206-4 at 6440 them: for the LORD 3068 thy God 430 [is] among 7130 you, a mighty 1419 God 410 and terrible. 3372-12

7:22 And the LORD 3068 thy God 430 will put out 5394-1 those 411 nations 1471 before 6440 thee by little 4592 and little: 4592 thou mayest 3201-4 not consume 3615-15 them at once, 4118 lest the beasts 2416 of the field 7704 increase 7235-4 upon thee.

7:23 But the LORD 3068 thy God 430 shall deliver 5414-1 them unto thee, 6440 and shall destroy 1949-1 them with a mighty 1419 destruction, 4103 until they be destroyed. 8045-9

7:24 And he shall deliver 5414-1 their kings 4428 into thine hand, 3027 and thou shalt destroy 6-52 their name 8034 from under heaven: 8064 there shall no man 376 be able to stand 3320-101 before 6440 thee, until thou have destroyed 8045-53 them.

7:25 The graven images 6456 of their gods 430 shall ye burn 8313-4 with fire: 784 thou shalt not desire 2530-4 the silver 3701 or gold 2091 [that is] on them, nor take 3947-1 [it] unto thee, lest thou be snared 3369-11 therein: for it [is] an abomination 8441 to the LORD 3068 thy God. 430

7:26 Neither shalt thou bring 935-55 an abomination 8441 into thine house, 1004 lest thou be a cursed thing 2764 like it: [but] thou shalt utterly 8262-15 detest 8262-17 it, and thou shalt utterly 8581-15 abhor 8581-17 it; for it [is] a cursed thing. 2764

8:1 All the commandments 4687 which I command 6680-18 thee this day 3117 shall ye observe 8104-4 to do, 6213-2 that ye may live, 2421-4 and multiply, 7235-1 and go in 935-1 and possess 3423-1 the land 776 which the LORD 3068 sware 7650-8 unto your fathers. 1

8:2 And thou shalt remember 2142-1 all the way 1870 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 led 3212-52 thee these forty 705 years 8141 in the wilderness, 4057 to humble 6031-15 thee, [and] to prove 5254-15 thee, to know 3045-2 what [was] in thine heart, 3824 whether thou wouldest keep 8104-4 his commandments, 4687 or no.

8:3 And he humbled 6031-17 thee, and suffered thee to hunger, 7456-55 and fed 398-55 thee with manna, 4478 which thou knewest 3045-1 not, neither did thy fathers 1 know; 3045-1 that he might make thee know 3045-53 that man 120 doth not live 2421-4 by bread 3899 only, 905 but by every [word] that proceedeth out 4161 of the mouth 6310 of the LORD 3068 doth man 120 live. 2421-4

8:4 Thy raiment 8071 waxed not old 1086-1 upon thee, neither did thy foot 7272 swell, 1216-1 these forty 705 years. 8141

8:5 Thou shalt also consider 3045-1 in 5973 thine heart, 3824 that, as a man 376 chasteneth 3256-17 his son, 1121 [so] the LORD 3068 thy God 430 chasteneth 3256-18 thee.

8:6 Therefore thou shalt keep 8104-1 the commandments 4687 of the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 to walk 3212-2 in his ways, 1870 and to fear 3372-2 him.

8:7 For the LORD 3068 thy God 430 bringeth 935-56 thee into a good 2896 land, 776 a land 776 of brooks 5158 of water, 4325 of fountains 5869 and depths 8415 that spring out 3318-6 of valleys 1237 and hills; 2022

8:8 A land 776 of wheat, 2406 and barley, 8184 and vines, 1612 and fig trees, 8384 and pomegranates; 7416 a land 776 of oil 8081 olive, 2132 and honey; 1706

8:9 A land 776 wherein thou shalt eat 398-4 bread 3899 without 3808 scarceness, 4544 thou shalt not lack 2637-4 any [thing] in it; a land 776 whose 834 stones 68 [are] iron, 1270 and out of whose hills 2042 thou mayest dig 2672-4 brass. 5178

8:10 When thou hast eaten 398-1 and art full, 7646-1 then thou shalt bless 1288-14 the LORD 3068 thy God 430 for the good 2896 land 776 which he hath given 5414-1 thee.

8:11 Beware 8104-10 that thou forget 7911-4 not the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 in not keeping 8104-2 his commandments, 4687 and his judgments, 4941 and his statutes, 2708 which I command 6680-18 thee this day: 3117

8:12 Lest [when] thou hast eaten 398-4 and art full, 7646-1 and hast built 1129-4 goodly 2896 houses, 1004 and dwelt 3427-1 [therein];

8:13 And [when] thy herds 1241 and thy flocks 6629 multiply, 7235-4 and thy silver 3701 and thy gold 2091 is multiplied, 7235-4 and all that thou hast is multiplied; 7235-4

8:14 Then thine heart 3824 be lifted up, 7311-1 and thou forget 7911-1 the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 which brought thee forth 3318-56 out of the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 from the house 1004 of bondage; 5650

8:15 Who led 3212-56 thee through that great 1419 and terrible 3372-12 wilderness, 4057 [wherein were] fiery 8314 serpents, 5175 and scorpions, 6137 and drought, 6774 where [there was] no water; 4325 who brought thee forth 3318-56 water 4325 out of the rock 6697 of flint; 2496

8:16 Who fed 398-56 thee in the wilderness 4057 with manna, 4478 which thy fathers 1 knew 3045-1 not, that he might humble 6031-15 thee, and that he might prove 5254-15 thee, to do thee good 3190-53 at thy latter end; 319

8:17 And thou say 559-1 in thine heart, 3824 My power 3581 and the might 6108 of [mine] hand 3027 hath gotten 6213-1 me this wealth. 2428

8:18 But thou shalt remember 2142-1 the LORD 3068 thy God: 430 for [it is] he that giveth 5414-6 thee power 3581 to get 6213-2 wealth, 2428 that he may establish 6965-53 his covenant 1285 which he sware 7650-8 unto thy fathers, 1 as [it is] this day. 3117

8:19 And it shall be, if thou do at all 7911-2 forget 7911-4 the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 and walk 1980-1 after 310 other 312 gods, 430 and serve 5647-1 them, and worship 7812-98 them, I testify 5749-52 against you this day 3117 that ye shall surely 6-2 perish. 6-4

8:20 As the nations 1471 which the LORD 3068 destroyeth 6-56 before your face, 6440 so shall ye perish; 6-4 because 6118 ye would not be obedient 8085-4 unto the voice 6963 of the LORD 3068 your God. 430

9:1 Hear, 8085-3 O Israel: 3478 Thou [art] to pass over 5674-6 Jordan 3383 this day, 3117 to go in 935-2 to possess 3423-2 nations 1471 greater 1419 and mightier 6099 than thyself, cities 5892 great 1419 and fenced 1219-7 up to heaven, 8064

9:2 A people 5971 great 1419 and tall, 7311-6 the children 1121 of the Anakims, 6062 whom thou knowest, 3045-1 and [of whom] thou hast heard 8085-1 [say], Who can stand 3320-101 before 6440 the children 1121 of Anak! 6061

9:3 Understand 3045-1 therefore this day, 3117 that the LORD 3068 thy God 430 [is] he which goeth over 5674-6 before 6440 thee; [as] a consuming 398-6 fire 784 he shall destroy 8045-55 them, and he shall bring them down 3665-55 before thy face: 6440 so shalt thou drive them out, 3423-52 and destroy 6-52 them quickly, 4118 as the LORD 3068 hath said 1696-14 unto thee.

9:4 Speak 559-4 not thou in thine heart, 3824 after that the LORD 3068 thy God 430 hath cast them out 1920-2 from before 6440 thee, saying, 559-2 For my righteousness 6666 the LORD 3068 hath brought me in 935-52 to possess 3423-2 this land: 776 but for the wickedness 7564 of these nations 1471 the LORD 3068 doth drive them out 3423-56 from before 6440 thee.

9:5 Not for thy righteousness, 6666 or for the uprightness 3476 of thine heart, 3824 dost thou go 935-6 to possess 3423-2 their land: 776 but for the wickedness 7564 of these nations 1471 the LORD 3068 thy God 430 doth drive them out 3423-56 from before 6440 thee, and that he may perform 6965-53 the word 1697 which the LORD 3068 sware 7650-8 unto thy fathers, 1 Abraham, 85 Isaac, 3327 and Jacob. 3290

9:6 Understand 3045-1 therefore, that the LORD 3068 thy God 430 giveth 5414-6 thee not this good 2896 land 776 to possess 3423-2 it for thy righteousness; 6666 for thou [art] a stiffnecked 6203 7186 people. 5971

9:7 Remember, 2142-3 [and] forget 7911-4 not, how thou provokedst the LORD 3068 thy God 430 to wrath 7107-52 in the wilderness: 4057 from 4480 the day 3117 that thou didst depart 3318-1 out of the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 until ye came 935-2 unto this place, 4725 ye have been rebellious 4784-56 against 5973 the LORD. 3068

9:8 Also in Horeb 2722 ye provoked the LORD 3068 to wrath, 7107-52 so that the LORD 3068 was angry 599-101 with you to have destroyed 8045-53 you.

9:9 When I was gone up 5927-2 into the mount 2022 to receive 3947-2 the tables 3871 of stone, 68 [even] the tables 3871 of the covenant 1285 which the LORD 3068 made 3772-1 with you, then I abode 3427-4 in the mount 2022 forty 705 days 3117 and forty 705 nights, 3915 I neither did eat 398-1 bread 3899 nor drink 8354-1 water: 4325

9:10 And the LORD 3068 delivered 5414-4 unto me two 8147 tables 3871 of stone 68 written 3789-7 with the finger 676 of God; 430 and on them [was written] according to all the words, 1697 which the LORD 3068 spake 1696-14 with you in the mount 2022 out of the midst 8432 of the fire 784 in the day 3117 of the assembly. 6951

9:11 And it came to pass at the end 7093 of forty 705 days 3117 and forty 705 nights, 3915 [that] the LORD 3068 gave 5414-1 me the two 8147 tables 3871 of stone, 68 [even] the tables 3871 of the covenant. 1285

9:12 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto me, Arise, 6965-3 get thee down 3381-3 quickly 4118 from hence; for thy people 5971 which thou hast brought forth 3318-52 out of Egypt 4714 have corrupted 7843-14 [themselves]; they are quickly 4118 turned aside 5493-1 out of the way 1870 which I commanded 6680-14 them; they have made 6213-1 them a molten image. 4541

9:13 Furthermore the LORD 3068 spake 559-4 unto me, saying, 559-2 I have seen 7200-1 this people, 5971 and, behold, it [is] a stiffnecked 6203 7186 people: 5971

9:14 Let me alone, 7503-54 that I may destroy 8045-55 them, and blot out 4229-4 their name 8034 from under heaven: 8064 and I will make 6213-4 of thee 854 a nation 1471 mightier 6099 and greater 7227 than they.

9:15 So I turned 6437-4 and came down 3381-4 from the mount, 2022 and the mount 2022 burned 1197-6 with fire: 784 and the two 8147 tables 3871 of the covenant 1285 [were] in my two 8147 hands. 3027

9:16 And I looked, 7200-4 and, behold, ye had sinned 2398-1 against the LORD 3068 your God, 430 [and] had made 6213-1 you a molten 4541 calf: 5695 ye had turned aside 5493-1 quickly 4118 out of the way 1870 which the LORD 3068 had commanded 6680-14 you.

9:17 And I took 8610-4 the two 8147 tables, 3871 and cast 7993-55 them out of 5921 my two 8147 hands, 3027 and brake 7665-17 them before your eyes. 5869

9:18 And I fell down 5307-101 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 as at the first, 7223 forty 705 days 3117 and forty 705 nights: 3915 I did neither eat 398-1 bread, 3899 nor drink 8354-1 water, 4325 because of all your sins 2403 which ye sinned, 2398-1 in doing 6213-2 wickedly 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD, 3068 to provoke him to anger. 3707-53

9:19 For I was afraid 3025-1 of 6440 the anger 639 and hot displeasure, 2534 wherewith the LORD 3068 was wroth 7107-1 against you to destroy 8045-53 you. But the LORD 3068 hearkened 8085-4 unto me at that time 6471 also.

9:20 And the LORD 3068 was very 3966 angry 599-98 with Aaron 175 to have destroyed 8045-53 him: and I prayed 6419-101 for Aaron 175 also the same time. 6256

9:21 And I took 3947-1 your sin, 2403 the calf 5695 which ye had made, 6213-1 and burnt 8313-4 it with fire, 784 and stamped 3807-4 it, [and] ground 2912-2 [it] very small, 3190-53 [even] until it was as small 1854-1 as dust: 6083 and I cast 7993-55 the dust 6083 thereof into the brook 5158 that descended 3381-6 out of the mount. 2022

9:22 And at Taberah, 8404 and at Massah, 4532 and at Kibrothhattaavah, 6914 ye provoked the LORD 3068 to wrath. 7107-56

9:23 Likewise when the LORD 3068 sent 7971-2 you from Kadeshbarnea, 6947 saying, 559-2 Go up 5927-3 and possess 3423-3 the land 776 which I have given 5414-1 you; then ye rebelled 4784-55 against the commandment 6310 of the LORD 3068 your God, 430 and ye believed 539-52 him not, nor hearkened 8085-1 to his voice. 6963

9:24 Ye have been rebellious 4784-56 against the LORD 3068 from the day 3117 that I knew 3045-2 you.

9:25 Thus I fell down 5307-101 before 6440 the LORD 3068 forty 705 days 3117 and forty 705 nights, 3915 as I fell down 5307-98 [at the first]; because the LORD 3068 had said 559-1 he would destroy 8045-53 you.

9:26 I prayed 6419-101 therefore unto the LORD, 3068 and said, 559-4 O Lord 136 GOD, 3069 destroy 7843-55 not thy people 5971 and thine inheritance, 5159 which thou hast redeemed 6299-1 through thy greatness, 1433 which thou hast brought forth 3318-52 out of Egypt 4714 with a mighty 2389 hand. 3027

9:27 Remember 2142-3 thy servants, 5650 Abraham, 85 Isaac, 3327 and Jacob; 3290 look 6437-4 not unto the stubbornness 7190 of this people, 5971 nor to their wickedness, 7562 nor to their sin: 2403

9:28 Lest the land 776 whence thou broughtest us out 3318-52 say, 559-4 Because the LORD 3068 was not able 3201-2 to bring 935-53 them into the land 776 which he promised 1696-14 them, and because he hated 8135 them, he hath brought them out 3318-52 to slay 4191-53 them in the wilderness. 4057

9:29 Yet they [are] thy people 5971 and thine inheritance, 5159 which thou broughtest out 3318-52 by thy mighty 1419 power 3581 and by thy stretched out 5186-7 arm. 2220

10:1 At that time 6256 the LORD 3068 said 559-1 unto me, Hew 6458-3 thee two 8147 tables 3871 of stone 68 like unto the first, 7223 and come up 5927-3 unto me into the mount, 2022 and make 6213-1 thee an ark 727 of wood. 6086

10:2 And I will write 3789-4 on the tables 3871 the words 1697 that were in the first 7223 tables 3871 which thou brakest, 7665-14 and thou shalt put 7760-1 them in the ark. 727

10:3 And I made 6213-4 an ark 727 [of] shittim 7848 wood, 6086 and hewed 6458-4 two 8147 tables 3871 of stone 68 like unto the first, 7223 and went up 5927-4 into the mount, 2022 having the two 8147 tables 3871 in mine hand. 3027

10:4 And he wrote 3789-4 on the tables, 3871 according to the first 7223 writing, 4385 the ten 6235 commandments, 1697 which the LORD 3068 spake 1696-14 unto you in the mount 2022 out of the midst 8432 of the fire 784 in the day 3117 of the assembly: 6951 and the LORD 3068 gave 5414-4 them unto me.

10:5 And I turned 6437-4 myself and came down 3381-4 from the mount, 2022 and put 7760-4 the tables 3871 in the ark 727 which I had made; 6213-1 and there they be, as the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 me.

10:6 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 took their journey 5265-1 from Beeroth of the children 1121 of Jaakan 885 to Mosera: 4149 there Aaron 175 died, 4191-1 and there he was buried; 6912-11 and Eleazar 499 his son 1121 ministered in the priest's office 3547-17 in his stead.

10:7 From thence they journeyed 5265-1 unto Gudgodah; 1412 and from Gudgodah 1412 to Jotbath, 3193 a land 776 of rivers 5158 of waters. 4325

10:8 At that time 6256 the LORD 3068 separated 914-52 the tribe 7626 of Levi, 3878 to bear 5375-2 the ark 727 of the covenant 1285 of the LORD, 3068 to stand 5975-2 before 6440 the LORD 3068 to minister 8334-15 unto him, and to bless 1288-15 in his name, 8034 unto this day. 3117

10:9 Wherefore Levi 3878 hath no part 2506 nor inheritance 5159 with his brethren; 251 the LORD 3068 [is] his inheritance, 5159 according as the LORD 3068 thy God 430 promised 1696-14 him.

10:10 And I stayed 5975-1 in the mount, 2022 according to the first 7223 time, 3117 forty 705 days 3117 and forty 705 nights; 3915 and the LORD 3068 hearkened 8085-4 unto me at that time 6471 also, [and] the LORD 3068 would 14-1 not destroy 7843-53 thee.

10:11 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto me, Arise, 6965-3 take 3212-3 [thy] journey 4550 before 6440 the people, 5971 that they may go in 935-4 and possess 3423-4 the land, 776 which I sware 7650-8 unto their fathers 1 to give 5414-2 unto them.

10:12 And now, Israel, 3478 what doth the LORD 3068 thy God 430 require 7592-6 of thee, but to fear 3372-2 the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 to walk 3212-2 in all his ways, 1870 and to love 157-2 him, and to serve 5647-2 the LORD 3068 thy God 430 with all thy heart 3824 and with all thy soul, 5315

10:13 To keep 8104-2 the commandments 4687 of the LORD, 3068 and his statutes, 2708 which I command 6680-18 thee this day 3117 for thy good? 2896

10:14 Behold, the heaven 8064 and the heaven 8064 of heavens 8064 [is] the LORD'S 3068 thy God, 430 the earth 776 [also], with all that therein [is].

10:15 Only the LORD 3068 had a delight 2836-1 in thy fathers 1 to love 157-2 them, and he chose 977-4 their seed 2233 after 310 them, [even] you above all people, 5971 as [it is] this day. 3117

10:16 Circumcise 4135-1 therefore the foreskin 6190 of your heart, 3824 and be no more stiffnecked. 6203 7185-55

10:17 For the LORD 3068 your God 430 [is] God 430 of gods, 430 and Lord 113 of lords, 113 a great 1419 God, 410 a mighty, 1368 and a terrible, 3372-12 which regardeth 5375-4 not persons, 6440 nor taketh 3947-4 reward: 7810

10:18 He doth execute 6213-6 the judgment 4941 of the fatherless 3490 and widow, 490 and loveth 157-6 the stranger, 1616 in giving 5414-2 him food 3899 and raiment. 8071

10:19 Love 157-1 ye therefore the stranger: 1616 for ye were strangers 1616 in the land 776 of Egypt. 4714

10:20 Thou shalt fear 3372-4 the LORD 3068 thy God; 430 him shalt thou serve, 5647-4 and to him shalt thou cleave, 1692-4 and swear 7650-11 by his name. 8034

10:21 He [is] thy praise, 8416 and he [is] thy God, 430 that hath done 6213-1 for thee these great 1419 and terrible 3372-12 things, which thine eyes 5869 have seen. 7200-1

10:22 Thy fathers 1 went down 3381-1 into Egypt 4714 with threescore and ten 7657 persons; 5315 and now the LORD 3068 thy God 430 hath made 7760-1 thee as the stars 3556 of heaven 8064 for multitude. 7230

11:1 Therefore thou shalt love 157-1 the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 and keep 8104-1 his charge, 4931 and his statutes, 2708 and his judgments, 4941 and his commandments, 4687 alway. 3605 3117

11:2 And know 3045-1 ye this day: 3117 for [I speak] not with your children 1121 which have not known, 3045-1 and which have not seen 7200-1 the chastisement 4148 of the LORD 3068 your God, 430 his greatness, 1433 his mighty 2389 hand, 3027 and his stretched out 5186-7 arm, 2220

11:3 And his miracles, 226 and his acts, 4639 which he did 6213-1 in the midst 8432 of Egypt 4714 unto Pharaoh 6547 the king 4428 of Egypt, 4714 and unto all his land; 776

11:4 And what he did 6213-1 unto the army 2428 of Egypt, 4714 unto their horses, 5483 and to their chariots; 7393 how he made the water 4325 of the Red 5488 sea 3220 to overflow 6687-52 them 6440 as they pursued 7291-2 after 310 you, and [how] the LORD 3068 hath destroyed 6-17 them unto this day; 3117

11:5 And what he did 6213-1 unto you in the wilderness, 4057 until ye came 935-2 into this place; 4725

11:6 And what he did 6213-1 unto Dathan 1885 and Abiram, 48 the sons 1121 of Eliab, 446 the son 1121 of Reuben: 7205 how the earth 776 opened 6475-1 her mouth, 6310 and swallowed them up, 1104-4 and their households, 1004 and their tents, 168 and all the substance 3351 that [was] in their possession, 7272 in the midst 7130 of all Israel: 3478

11:7 But your eyes 5869 have seen 7200-6 all the great 1419 acts 4639 of the LORD 3068 which he did. 6213-1

11:8 Therefore shall ye keep 8104-1 all the commandments 4687 which I command 6680-18 you this day, 3117 that ye may be strong, 2388-4 and go in 935-1 and possess 3423-1 the land, 776 whither 834 ye go 5674-6 to possess 3423-2 it;

11:9 And that ye may prolong 748-55 [your] days 3117 in the land, 127 which the LORD 3068 sware 7650-8 unto your fathers 1 to give 5414-2 unto them and to their seed, 2233 a land 776 that floweth 2100-6 with milk 2461 and honey. 1706

11:10 For the land, 776 whither thou goest in 935-6 to possess 3423-2 it, [is] not as the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 from whence ye came out, 3318-1 where thou sowedst 2232-4 thy seed, 2233 and wateredst 8248-52 [it] with thy foot, 7272 as a garden 1588 of herbs: 3419

11:11 But the land, 776 whither ye go 5674-6 to possess 3423-2 it, [is] a land 776 of hills 2022 and valleys, 1237 [and] drinketh 8354-4 water 4325 of the rain 4306 of heaven: 8064

11:12 A land 776 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 careth for: 1875-6 the eyes 5869 of the LORD 3068 thy God 430 [are] always 8548 upon it, from the beginning 7225 of the year 8141 even unto the end 319 of the year. 8141

11:13 And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken 8085-4 diligently 8085-2 unto my commandments 4687 which I command 6680-18 you this day, 3117 to love 157-2 the LORD 3068 your God, 430 and to serve 5647-2 him with all your heart 3824 and with all your soul, 5315

11:14 That I will give 5414-1 [you] the rain 4306 of your land 776 in his due season, 6256 the first rain 3138 and the latter rain, 4456 that thou mayest gather 622-1 in thy corn, 1715 and thy wine, 8492 and thine oil. 3323

11:15 And I will send 5414-1 grass 6212 in thy fields 7704 for thy cattle, 929 that thou mayest eat 398-1 and be full. 7646-1

11:16 Take heed 8104-10 to yourselves, that your heart 3824 be not deceived, 6601-4 and ye turn aside, 5493-1 and serve 5647-1 other 312 gods, 430 and worship 7812-98 them;

11:17 And [then] the LORD'S 3068 wrath 639 be kindled 2734-1 against you, and he shut up 6113-1 the heaven, 8064 that there be no rain, 4306 and that the land 127 yield 5414-4 not her fruit; 2981 and [lest] ye perish 6-1 quickly 4120 from off the good 2896 land 776 which the LORD 3068 giveth 5414-6 you.

11:18 Therefore shall ye lay up 7760-1 these my words 1697 in your heart 3824 and in your soul, 5315 and bind 7194-1 them for a sign 226 upon your hand, 3027 that they may be as frontlets 2903 between your eyes. 5869

11:19 And ye shall teach 3925-14 them your children, 1121 speaking 1696-15 of them when thou sittest 3427-2 in thine house, 1004 and when thou walkest 3212-2 by the way, 1870 when thou liest 7901-2 down, and when thou risest up. 6965-2

11:20 And thou shalt write 3789-1 them upon the door posts 4201 of thine house, 1004 and upon thy gates: 8179

11:21 That your days 3117 may be multiplied, 7235-4 and the days 3117 of your children, 1121 in the land 127 which the LORD 3068 sware 7650-8 unto your fathers 1 to give 5414-2 them, as the days 3117 of heaven 8064 upon the earth. 776

11:22 For if ye shall diligently 8104-2 keep 8104-4 all these commandments 4687 which I command 6680-18 you, to do 6213-2 them, to love 157-2 the LORD 3068 your God, 430 to walk 3212-2 in all his ways, 1870 and to cleave 1692-2 unto him;

11:23 Then will the LORD 3068 drive out 3423-52 all these nations 1471 from before 6440 you, and ye shall possess 3423-1 greater 1419 nations 1471 and mightier 6099 than yourselves.

11:24 Every place 4725 whereon the soles 3709 of your feet 7272 shall tread 1869-4 shall be yours: from the wilderness 4057 and Lebanon, 3844 from the river, 5104 the river 5104 Euphrates, 6578 even unto the uttermost 314 sea 3220 shall your coast 1366 be.

11:25 There shall no man 376 be able to stand 3320-101 before 6440 you: [for] the LORD 3068 your God 430 shall lay 5414-4 the fear 6343 of you and the dread 4172 of you upon 6440 all the land 776 that ye shall tread 1869-4 upon, as he hath said 1696-14 unto you.

11:26 Behold, 7200-3 I set 5414-6 before 6440 you this day 3117 a blessing 1293 and a curse; 7045

11:27 A blessing, 1293 if ye obey 8085-4 the commandments 4687 of the LORD 3068 your God, 430 which I command 6680-18 you this day: 3117

11:28 And a curse, 7045 if ye will not obey 8085-4 the commandments 4687 of the LORD 3068 your God, 430 but turn aside 5493-1 out of the way 1870 which I command 6680-18 you this day, 3117 to go 3212-2 after 310 other 312 gods, 430 which ye have not known. 3045-1

11:29 And it shall come to pass, when the LORD 3068 thy God 430 hath brought thee in 935-55 unto the land 776 whither thou goest 935-6 to possess 3423-2 it, that thou shalt put 5414-1 the blessing 1293 upon mount 2022 Gerizim, 1630 and the curse 7045 upon mount 2022 Ebal. 5858

11:30 [Are] they not on the other side 5676 Jordan, 3383 by 310 the way 1870 where the sun 8121 goeth down, 3996 in the land 776 of the Canaanites, 3669 which dwell 3427-6 in the champaign 6160 over against 4136 Gilgal, 1537 beside 681 the plains 436 of Moreh? 4176

11:31 For ye shall pass over 5674-6 Jordan 3383 to go in 935-2 to possess 3423-2 the land 776 which the LORD 3068 your God 430 giveth 5414-6 you, and ye shall possess 3423-1 it, and dwell 3427-1 therein.

11:32 And ye shall observe 8104-1 to do 6213-2 all the statutes 2706 and judgments 4941 which I set 5414-6 before 6440 you this day. 3117

12:1 These [are] the statutes 2706 and judgments, 4941 which ye shall observe 8104-4 to do 6213-2 in the land, 776 which the LORD 3068 God 430 of thy fathers 1 giveth 5414-1 thee to possess 3423-2 it, all the days 3117 that ye live 2416 upon the earth. 127

12:2 Ye shall utterly 6-15 destroy 6-17 all the places, 4725 wherein 834 the nations 1471 which ye shall possess 3423-6 served 5647-1 their gods, 430 upon the high 7311-6 mountains, 2022 and upon the hills, 1389 and under every green 7488 tree: 6086

12:3 And ye shall overthrow 5422-14 their altars, 4196 and break 7665-14 their pillars, 4676 and burn 8313-4 their groves 842 with fire; 784 and ye shall hew down 1438-17 the graven images 6456 of their gods, 430 and destroy 6-14 the names 8034 of them out of that place. 4725

12:4 Ye shall not do 6213-4 so unto the LORD 3068 your God. 430

12:5 But unto the place 4725 which the LORD 3068 your God 430 shall choose 977-4 out of all your tribes 7626 to put 7760-2 his name 8034 there, [even] unto his habitation 7933 shall ye seek, 1875-4 and thither thou shalt come: 935-1

12:6 And thither ye shall bring 935-52 your burnt offerings, 5930 and your sacrifices, 2077 and your tithes, 4643 and heave offerings 8641 of your hand, 3027 and your vows, 5088 and your freewill offerings, 5071 and the firstlings 1062 of your herds 1241 and of your flocks: 6629

12:7 And there ye shall eat 398-1 before 6440 the LORD 3068 your God, 430 and ye shall rejoice 8055-1 in all that ye put 4916 your hand 3027 unto, ye and your households, 1004 wherein the LORD 3068 thy God 430 hath blessed 1288-14 thee.

12:8 Ye shall not do 6213-4 after all [the things] that we do 6213-6 here this day, 3117 every man 376 whatsoever [is] right 3477 in his own eyes. 5869

12:9 For ye are not as yet come 935-1 to the rest 4496 and to the inheritance, 5159 which the LORD 3068 your God 430 giveth 5414-6 you.

12:10 But [when] ye go over 5674-1 Jordan, 3383 and dwell 3427-1 in the land 776 which the LORD 3068 your God 430 giveth you to inherit, 5157-56 and [when] he giveth you rest 5117-52 from all your enemies 341-6 round about, 5439 so that ye dwell 3427-1 in safety; 983

12:11 Then there shall be a place 4725 which the LORD 3068 your God 430 shall choose 977-4 to cause his name 8034 to dwell 7931-15 there; thither shall ye bring 935-55 all that I command 6680-18 you; your burnt offerings, 5930 and your sacrifices, 2077 your tithes, 4643 and the heave offering 8641 of your hand, 3027 and all your choice 4005 vows 5088 which ye vow 5087-4 unto the LORD: 3068

12:12 And ye shall rejoice 8055-1 before 6440 the LORD 3068 your God, 430 ye, and your sons, 1121 and your daughters, 1323 and your menservants, 5650 and your maidservants, 519 and the Levite 3881 that [is] within your gates; 8179 forasmuch 3588 as he hath no part 2506 nor inheritance 5159 with you.

12:13 Take heed 8104-10 to thyself that thou offer 5927-55 not thy burnt offerings 5930 in every place 4725 that thou seest: 7200-4

12:14 But in the place 4725 which the LORD 3068 shall choose 977-4 in one 259 of thy tribes, 7626 there thou shalt offer 5927-55 thy burnt offerings, 5930 and there thou shalt do 6213-4 all that I command 6680-18 thee.

12:15 Notwithstanding thou mayest kill 2076-4 and eat 398-1 flesh 1320 in all thy gates, 8179 whatsoever thy soul 5315 lusteth after, 185 according to the blessing 1293 of the LORD 3068 thy God 430 which he hath given 5414-1 thee: the unclean 2931 and the clean 2889 may eat 398-4 thereof, as of the roebuck, 6643 and as of the hart. 354

12:16 Only ye shall not eat 398-4 the blood; 1818 ye shall pour 8210-4 it upon the earth 776 as water. 4325

12:17 Thou mayest 3201-4 not eat 398-2 within thy gates 8179 the tithe 4643 of thy corn, 1715 or of thy wine, 8492 or of thy oil, 3323 or the firstlings 1062 of thy herds 1241 or of thy flock, 6629 nor any of thy vows 5088 which thou vowest, 5087-4 nor thy freewill offerings, 5071 or heave offering 8641 of thine hand: 3027

12:18 But thou must eat 398-4 them before 6440 the LORD 3068 thy God 430 in the place 4725 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 shall choose, 977-4 thou, and thy son, 1121 and thy daughter, 1323 and thy manservant, 5650 and thy maidservant, 519 and the Levite 3881 that [is] within thy gates: 8179 and thou shalt rejoice 8055-1 before 6440 the LORD 3068 thy God 430 in all that thou puttest 4916 thine hands 3027 unto.

12:19 Take heed 8104-10 to thyself that thou forsake 5800-4 not the Levite 3881 as long 3605 as thou livest 3117 upon the earth. 127

12:20 When the LORD 3068 thy God 430 shall enlarge 7337-55 thy border, 1366 as he hath promised 1696-14 thee, and thou shalt say, 559-1 I will eat 398-4 flesh, 1320 because thy soul 5315 longeth 183-17 to eat 398-2 flesh; 1320 thou mayest eat 398-4 flesh, 1320 whatsoever thy soul 5315 lusteth after. 185

12:21 If the place 4725 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 hath chosen 977-4 to put 7760-2 his name 8034 there be too far 7368-4 from thee, then thou shalt kill 2076-1 of thy herd 1241 and of thy flock, 6629 which the LORD 3068 hath given 5414-1 thee, as I have commanded 6680-14 thee, and thou shalt eat 398-1 in thy gates 8179 whatsoever thy soul 5315 lusteth after. 185

12:22 Even as the roebuck 6643 and the hart 354 is eaten, 398-11 so thou shalt eat 398-4 them: the unclean 2931 and the clean 2889 shall eat 398-4 [of] them alike. 3162

12:23 Only be sure 2388-3 that thou eat 398-2 not the blood: 1818 for the blood 1818 [is] the life; 5315 and thou mayest not eat 398-4 the life 5315 with the flesh. 1320

12:24 Thou shalt not eat 398-4 it; thou shalt pour 8210-4 it upon the earth 776 as water. 4325

12:25 Thou shalt not eat 398-4 it; that it may go well 3190-4 with thee, and with thy children 1121 after 310 thee, when thou shalt do 6213-4 [that which is] right 3477 in the sight 5869 of the LORD. 3068

12:26 Only thy holy things 6944 which thou hast, and thy vows, 5088 thou shalt take, 5375-4 and go 935-1 unto the place 4725 which the LORD 3068 shall choose: 977-4

12:27 And thou shalt offer 6213-1 thy burnt offerings, 5930 the flesh 1320 and the blood, 1818 upon the altar 4196 of the LORD 3068 thy God: 430 and the blood 1818 of thy sacrifices 2077 shall be poured out 8210-11 upon the altar 4196 of the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 and thou shalt eat 398-4 the flesh. 1320

12:28 Observe 8104-3 and hear 8085-1 all these words 1697 which I command 6680-18 thee, that it may go well 3190-4 with thee, and with thy children 1121 after 310 thee for 5704 ever, 5769 when thou doest 6213-4 [that which is] good 2896 and right 3477 in the sight 5869 of the LORD 3068 thy God. 430

12:29 When the LORD 3068 thy God 430 shall cut off 3772-55 the nations 1471 from before 6440 thee, whither thou goest 935-6 to possess 3423-2 them, and thou succeedest 3423-1 them, and dwellest 3427-1 in their land; 776

12:30 Take heed 8104-10 to thyself that thou be not snared 5367-11 by following 310 them, after 310 that they be destroyed 8045-9 from before 6440 thee; and that thou enquire 1875-4 not after their gods, 430 saying, 559-2 How did these nations 1471 serve 5647-4 their gods? 430 even so will I do 6213-4 likewise. 1571

12:31 Thou shalt not do 6213-4 so unto the LORD 3068 thy God: 430 for every abomination 8441 to the LORD, 3068 which he hateth, 8130-1 have they done 6213-1 unto their gods; 430 for even their sons 1121 and their daughters 1323 they have burnt 8313-4 in the fire 784 to their gods. 430

12:32 What thing 1697 soever I command 6680-18 you, observe 8104-4 to do 6213-2 it: thou shalt not add 3254-55 thereto, nor diminish 1639-4 from it.

13:1 If there arise 6965-4 among 7130 you a prophet, 5030 or a dreamer 2492-6 of dreams, 2472 and giveth 5414-1 thee a sign 226 or a wonder, 4159

13:2 And the sign 226 or the wonder 4159 come to pass, 935-1 whereof he spake 1696-14 unto thee, saying, 559-2 Let us go 3212-4 after 310 other 312 gods, 430 which thou hast not known, 3045-1 and let us serve 5647-93 them;

13:3 Thou shalt not hearken 8085-4 unto the words 1697 of that prophet, 5030 or that dreamer 2492-6 of dreams: 2472 for the LORD 3068 your God 430 proveth 5254-18 you, to know 3045-2 whether ye 3426 love 157-6 the LORD 3068 your God 430 with all your heart 3824 and with all your soul. 5315

13:4 Ye shall walk 3212-4 after 310 the LORD 3068 your God, 430 and fear 3372-4 him, and keep 8104-4 his commandments, 4687 and obey 8085-4 his voice, 6963 and ye shall serve 5647-4 him, and cleave 1692-4 unto him.

13:5 And that prophet, 5030 or that dreamer 2492-6 of dreams, 2472 shall be put to death; 4191-93 because he hath spoken 1696-14 to turn [you] away 5627 from the LORD 3068 your God, 430 which brought you out 3318-56 of the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 and redeemed 6299-6 you out of the house 1004 of bondage, 5650 to thrust 5080-53 thee out of the way 1870 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 commanded 6680-14 thee to walk 3212-2 in. So shalt thou put the evil 7451 away 1197-14 from the midst 7130 of thee.

13:6 If thy brother, 251 the son 1121 of thy mother, 517 or thy son, 1121 or thy daughter, 1323 or the wife 802 of thy bosom, 2436 or thy friend, 7453 which [is] as thine own soul, 5315 entice 5496-55 thee secretly, 5643 saying, 559-2 Let us go 3212-4 and serve 5647-4 other 312 gods, 430 which thou hast not known, 3045-1 thou, nor thy fathers; 1

13:7 [Namely], of the gods 430 of the people 5971 which [are] round about 5439 you, nigh 7138 unto thee, or far off 7350 from thee, from the [one] end 7097 of the earth 776 even unto the [other] end 7097 of the earth; 776

13:8 Thou shalt not consent 14-4 unto him, nor hearken 8085-4 unto him; neither shall thine eye 5869 pity 2347-4 him, neither shalt thou spare, 2550-4 neither shalt thou conceal 3680-17 him:

13:9 But thou shalt surely 2026-2 kill 2026-4 him; thine hand 3027 shall be first 7223 upon him to put him to death, 4191-53 and afterwards 314 the hand 3027 of all the people. 5971

13:10 And thou shalt stone 5619-1 him with stones, 68 that he die; 4191-1 because he hath sought 1245-14 to thrust thee away 5080-53 from the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 which brought thee out 3318-56 of the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 from the house 1004 of bondage. 5650

13:11 And all Israel 3478 shall hear, 8085-4 and fear, 3372-4 and shall do 6213-2 no more 3254-55 any such 1697 wickedness 7451 as this is among 7130 you.

13:12 If thou shalt hear 8085-4 [say] in one 259 of thy cities, 5892 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 hath given 5414-6 thee to dwell 3427-2 there, saying, 559-2

13:13 [Certain] men, 582 the children 1121 of Belial, 1100 are gone out 3318-1 from among 7130 you, and have withdrawn 5080-55 the inhabitants 3427-6 of their city, 5892 saying, 559-2 Let us go 3212-4 and serve 5647-4 other 312 gods, 430 which ye have not known; 3045-1

13:14 Then shalt thou enquire, 1875-1 and make search, 2713-1 and ask 7592-1 diligently; 3190-53 and, behold, [if it be] truth, 571 [and] the thing 1697 certain, 3559-12 [that] such 2063 abomination 8441 is wrought 6213-8 among 7130 you;

13:15 Thou shalt surely 5221-53 smite 5221-55 the inhabitants 3427-6 of that city 5892 with the edge 6310 of the sword, 2719 destroying it utterly, 2763-54 and all that [is] therein, and the cattle 929 thereof, with the edge 6310 of the sword. 2719

13:16 And thou shalt gather 6908-4 all the spoil 7998 of it into the midst 8432 of the street 7339 thereof, and shalt burn 8313-1 with fire 784 the city, 5892 and all the spoil 7998 thereof every whit, 3632 for the LORD 3068 thy God: 430 and it shall be an heap 8510 for ever; 5769 it shall not 3808 be built 1129-11 again. 5750

13:17 And there shall cleave 1692-4 nought 3972 of the cursed thing 2764 to thine hand: 3027 that the LORD 3068 may turn 7725-4 from the fierceness 2740 of his anger, 639 and shew 5414-1 thee mercy, 7356 and have compassion 7355-14 upon thee, and multiply 7235-52 thee, as he hath sworn 7650-8 unto thy fathers; 1

13:18 When thou shalt hearken 8085-4 to the voice 6963 of the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 to keep 8104-2 all his commandments 4687 which I command 6680-18 thee this day, 3117 to do 6213-2 [that which is] right 3477 in the eyes 5869 of the LORD 3068 thy God. 430

14:1 Ye [are] the children 1121 of the LORD 3068 your God: 430 ye shall not cut 1413-108 yourselves, nor make 7760-4 any baldness 7144 between your eyes 5869 for the dead. 4191-5

14:2 For thou [art] an holy 6918 people 5971 unto the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 and the LORD 3068 hath chosen 977-1 thee to be a peculiar 5459 people 5971 unto himself, above all the nations 5971 that [are] upon 6440 the earth. 127

14:3 Thou shalt not eat 398-4 any abominable thing. 8441

14:4 These [are] the beasts 929 which ye shall eat: 398-4 the ox, 7794 the sheep, 7716 3775 and the goat, 7716 5795

14:5 The hart, 354 and the roebuck, 6643 and the fallow deer, 3180 and the wild goat, 689 and the pygarg, 1788 and the wild ox, 8377 and the chamois. 2169

14:6 And every beast 929 that parteth 6536-56 the hoof, 6541 and cleaveth 8156-6 the cleft 8157 into two 8147 claws, 6541 [and] cheweth 5927-56 the cud 1625 among the beasts, 929 that ye shall eat. 398-4

14:7 Nevertheless these ye shall not eat 398-4 of them that chew 5927-56 the cud, 1625 or of them that divide 6536-56 the cloven 8156-7 hoof; 6541 [as] the camel, 1581 and the hare, 768 and the coney: 8227 for they chew 5927-56 the cud, 1625 but divide 6536-52 not the hoof; 6541 [therefore] they [are] unclean 2931 unto you.

14:8 And the swine, 2386 because it divideth 6536-56 the hoof, 6541 yet cheweth not the cud, 1625 it [is] unclean 2931 unto you: ye shall not eat 398-4 of their flesh, 1320 nor touch 5060-4 their dead carcase. 5038

14:9 These ye shall eat 398-4 of all that [are] in the waters: 4325 all that have fins 5579 and scales 7193 shall ye eat: 398-4

14:10 And whatsoever hath not fins 5579 and scales 7193 ye may not eat; 398-4 it [is] unclean 2931 unto you.

14:11 [Of] all clean 2889 birds 6833 ye shall eat. 398-4

14:12 But these [are they] of which ye shall not eat: 398-4 the eagle, 5404 and the ossifrage, 6538 and the ospray, 5822

14:13 And the glede, 7201 and the kite, 344 and the vulture 1772 after his kind, 4327

14:14 And every raven 6158 after his kind, 4327

14:15 And the owl, 1323 3284 and the night hawk, 8464 and the cuckow, 7828 and the hawk 5322 after his kind, 4327

14:16 The little owl, 3563 and the great owl, 3244 and the swan, 8580

14:17 And the pelican, 6893 and the gier eagle, 7360 and the cormorant, 7994

14:18 And the stork, 2624 and the heron 601 after her kind, 4327 and the lapwing, 1744 and the bat. 5847

14:19 And every creeping thing 8318 that flieth 5775 [is] unclean 2931 unto you: they shall not be eaten. 398-11

14:20 [But of] all clean 2889 fowls 5775 ye may eat. 398-4

14:21 Ye shall not eat 398-4 [of] any thing that dieth of itself: 5038 thou shalt give 5414-4 it unto the stranger 1616 that [is] in thy gates, 8179 that he may eat 398-1 it; or thou mayest sell 4376-2 it unto an alien: 5237 for thou [art] an holy 6918 people 5971 unto the LORD 3068 thy God. 430 Thou shalt not seethe 1310-17 a kid 1423 in his mother's 517 milk. 2461

14:22 Thou shalt truly 6237-15 tithe 6237-17 all the increase 8393 of thy seed, 2233 that the field 7704 bringeth forth 3318-6 year 8141 by year. 8141

14:23 And thou shalt eat 398-1 before 6440 the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 in the place 4725 which he shall choose 977-4 to place 7931-15 his name 8034 there, the tithe 4643 of thy corn, 1715 of thy wine, 8492 and of thine oil, 3323 and the firstlings 1062 of thy herds 1241 and of thy flocks; 6629 that thou mayest learn 3925-4 to fear 3372-2 the LORD 3068 thy God 430 always. 3605 3117

14:24 And if the way 1870 be too long 7235-4 for thee, so that 3588 thou art not able 3201-4 to carry 5375-2 it; [or] if the place 4725 be too far 7368-4 from thee, which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 shall choose 977-4 to set 7760-2 his name 8034 there, when the LORD 3068 thy God 430 hath blessed 1288-17 thee:

14:25 Then shalt thou turn 5414-1 [it] into money, 3701 and bind up 6696-1 the money 3701 in thine hand, 3027 and shalt go 1980-1 unto the place 4725 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 shall choose: 977-4

14:26 And thou shalt bestow 5414-1 that money 3701 for whatsoever thy soul 5315 lusteth after, 183-17 for oxen, 1241 or for sheep, 6629 or for wine, 3196 or for strong drink, 7941 or for whatsoever thy soul 5315 desireth: 7592-4 and thou shalt eat 398-1 there before 6440 the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 and thou shalt rejoice, 8055-1 thou, and thine household, 1004

14:27 And the Levite 3881 that [is] within thy gates; 8179 thou shalt not forsake 5800-4 him; for he hath no part 2506 nor inheritance 5159 with thee.

14:28 At the end 7097 of three 7969 years 8141 thou shalt bring forth 3318-55 all the tithe 4643 of thine increase 8393 the same year, 8141 and shalt lay [it] up 3240-52 within thy gates: 8179

14:29 And the Levite, 3881 (because he hath no part 2506 nor inheritance 5159 with thee,) and the stranger, 1616 and the fatherless, 3490 and the widow, 490 which [are] within thy gates, 8179 shall come, 935-1 and shall eat 398-1 and be satisfied; 7646-1 that the LORD 3068 thy God 430 may bless 1288-17 thee in all the work 4639 of thine hand 3027 which thou doest. 6213-4

15:1 At the end 7093 of [every] seven 7651 years 8141 thou shalt make 6213-4 a release. 8059

15:2 And this [is] the manner 1697 of the release: 8059 Every creditor 1167 4874 3027 that lendeth 5383-55 [ought] unto his neighbour 7453 shall release 8058-2 [it]; he shall not exact 5065-4 [it] of his neighbour, 7453 or of his brother; 251 because it is called 7121-1 the LORD'S 3068 release. 8059

15:3 Of a foreigner 5237 thou mayest exact 5065-4 [it again]: but [that] which is thine with thy brother 251 thine hand 3027 shall release; 8058-55

15:4 Save 657 when there shall be no poor 34 among you; for the LORD 3068 shall greatly 1288-15 bless 1288-17 thee in the land 776 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 giveth 5414-6 thee [for] an inheritance 5159 to possess 3423-2 it:

15:5 Only if thou carefully 8085-2 hearken 8085-4 unto the voice 6963 of the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 to observe 8104-2 to do 6213-2 all these commandments 4687 which I command 6680-18 thee this day. 3117

15:6 For the LORD 3068 thy God 430 blesseth 1288-14 thee, as he promised 1696-14 thee: and thou shalt lend 5670-52 unto many 7227 nations, 1471 but thou shalt not borrow; 5670-4 and thou shalt reign 4910-1 over many 7227 nations, 1471 but they shall not reign 4910-4 over thee.

15:7 If there be among you a poor man 34 of one 259 of thy brethren 251 within any 259 of thy gates 8179 in thy land 776 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 giveth 5414-6 thee, thou shalt not harden 553-17 thine heart, 3824 nor shut 7092-4 thine hand 3027 from thy poor 34 brother: 251

15:8 But thou shalt open 6605-4 thine hand 3027 wide 6605-2 unto him, and shalt surely 5670-53 lend 5670-55 him sufficient 1767 for his need, 4270 [in that] which he wanteth. 2637-4

15:9 Beware 8104-10 that there be not a thought 1697 in thy wicked 1100 heart, 3824 saying, 559-2 The seventh 7651 year, 8141 the year 8141 of release, 8059 is at hand; 7126-1 and thine eye 5869 be evil 7489-1 against thy poor 34 brother, 251 and thou givest 5414-4 him nought; and he cry 7121-1 unto the LORD 3068 against thee, and it be sin 2399 unto thee.

15:10 Thou shalt surely 5414-2 give 5414-4 him, and thine heart 3824 shall not be grieved 3415-4 when thou givest 5414-2 unto him: because 1558 that for this thing 1697 the LORD 3068 thy God 430 shall bless 1288-17 thee in all thy works, 4639 and in all that thou puttest 4916 thine hand 3027 unto.

15:11 For the poor 34 shall never cease 2308-4 out of 7130 the land: 776 therefore I command 6680-18 thee, saying, 559-2 Thou shalt open 6605-4 thine hand 3027 wide 6605-2 unto thy brother, 251 to thy poor, 6041 and to thy needy, 34 in thy land. 776

15:12 [And] if thy brother, 251 an Hebrew man, 5680 or an Hebrew woman, 5680 be sold 4376-11 unto thee, and serve 5647-1 thee six 8337 years; 8141 then in the seventh 7637 year 8141 thou shalt let him go 7971-17 free 2670 from thee.

15:13 And when thou sendest him out 7971-17 free 2670 from thee, thou shalt not let him go away 7971-17 empty: 7387

15:14 Thou shalt furnish 6059-55 him liberally 6059-53 out of thy flock, 6629 and out of thy floor, 1637 and out of thy winepress: 3342 [of that] wherewith the LORD 3068 thy God 430 hath blessed 1288-14 thee thou shalt give 5414-4 unto him.

15:15 And thou shalt remember 2142-1 that thou wast a bondman 5650 in the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 and the LORD 3068 thy God 430 redeemed 6299-4 thee: therefore I command 6680-18 thee this thing 1697 to day. 3117

15:16 And it shall be, if he say 559-4 unto thee, I will not go away 3318-4 from thee; because he loveth 157-1 thee and thine house, 1004 because he is well 2895-1 with thee;

15:17 Then thou shalt take 3947-1 an aul, 4836 and thrust 5414-1 [it] through his ear 241 unto the door, 1817 and he shall be thy servant 5650 for ever. 5769 And also unto thy maidservant 519 thou shalt do 6213-4 likewise.

15:18 It shall not seem hard 7185-4 unto thee, 5869 when thou sendest him away 7971-15 free 2670 from thee; for he hath been worth 7939 a double 4932 hired servant 7916 [to thee], in serving 5647-1 thee six 8337 years: 8141 and the LORD 3068 thy God 430 shall bless 1288-14 thee in all that thou doest. 6213-4

15:19 All the firstling 1060 males 2145 that come 3205-11 of thy herd 1241 and of thy flock 6629 thou shalt sanctify 6942-55 unto the LORD 3068 thy God: 430 thou shalt do no work 5647-4 with the firstling 1060 of thy bullock, 7794 nor shear 1494-4 the firstling 1060 of thy sheep. 6629

15:20 Thou shalt eat 398-4 [it] before 6440 the LORD 3068 thy God 430 year 8141 by year 8141 in the place 4725 which the LORD 3068 shall choose, 977-4 thou and thy household. 1004

15:21 And if there be [any] blemish 3971 therein, [as if it be] lame, 6455 or blind, 5787 [or have] any ill 7451 blemish, 3971 thou shalt not sacrifice 2076-4 it unto the LORD 3068 thy God. 430

15:22 Thou shalt eat 398-4 it within thy gates: 8179 the unclean 2931 and the clean 2889 [person shall eat it] alike, 3162 as the roebuck, 6643 and as the hart. 354

15:23 Only thou shalt not eat 398-4 the blood 1818 thereof; thou shalt pour 8210-4 it upon the ground 776 as water. 4325

16:1 Observe 8104-2 the month 2320 of Abib, 24 and keep 6213-1 the passover 6453 unto the LORD 3068 thy God: 430 for in the month 2320 of Abib 24 the LORD 3068 thy God 430 brought thee forth 3318-52 out of Egypt 4714 by night. 3915

16:2 Thou shalt therefore sacrifice 2076-1 the passover 6453 unto the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 of the flock 6629 and the herd, 1241 in the place 4725 which the LORD 3068 shall choose 977-4 to place 7931-15 his name 8034 there.

16:3 Thou shalt eat 398-4 no leavened bread 2557 with it; seven 7651 days 3117 shalt thou eat 398-4 unleavened bread 4682 therewith, [even] the bread 3899 of affliction; 6040 for thou camest forth 3318-1 out of the land 776 of Egypt 4714 in haste: 2649 that thou mayest remember 2142-4 the day 3117 when thou camest forth 3318-2 out of the land 776 of Egypt 4714 all the days 3117 of thy life. 2416

16:4 And there shall be no leavened 7603 bread seen 7200-11 with thee in all thy coast 1366 seven 7651 days; 3117 neither shall there [any thing] of the flesh, 1320 which thou sacrificedst 2076-4 the first 7223 day 3117 at even, 6153 remain 3885-4 all night until the morning. 1242

16:5 Thou mayest 3201-4 not sacrifice 2076-2 the passover 6453 within any 259 of thy gates, 8179 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 giveth 5414-6 thee:

16:6 But at the place 4725 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 shall choose 977-4 to place 7931-15 his name 8034 in, there thou shalt sacrifice 2076-4 the passover 6453 at even, 6153 at the going down 935-2 of the sun, 8121 at the season 4150 that thou camest forth out 3318-2 of Egypt. 4714

16:7 And thou shalt roast 1310-14 and eat 398-1 [it] in the place 4725 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 shall choose: 977-4 and thou shalt turn 6437-1 in the morning, 1242 and go 1980-1 unto thy tents. 168

16:8 Six 8337 days 3117 thou shalt eat 398-4 unleavened bread: 4682 and on the seventh 7637 day 3117 [shall be] a solemn assembly 6116 to the LORD 3068 thy God: 430 thou shalt do 6213-4 no work 4399 [therein].

16:9 Seven 7651 weeks 7620 shalt thou number 5608-4 unto thee: begin 2490-55 to number 5608-2 the seven 7651 weeks 7620 from [such time as] thou beginnest 2490-53 [to put] the sickle 2770 to the corn. 7054

16:10 And thou shalt keep 6213-1 the feast 2282 of weeks 7620 unto the LORD 3068 thy God 430 with a tribute 4530 of a freewill offering 5071 of thine hand, 3027 which thou shalt give 5414-4 [unto the LORD thy God], according as the LORD 3068 thy God 430 hath blessed 1288-17 thee:

16:11 And thou shalt rejoice 8055-1 before 6440 the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 thou, and thy son, 1121 and thy daughter, 1323 and thy manservant, 5650 and thy maidservant, 519 and the Levite 3881 that [is] within thy gates, 8179 and the stranger, 1616 and the fatherless, 3490 and the widow, 490 that [are] among 7130 you, in the place 4725 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 hath chosen 977-4 to place 7931-15 his name 8034 there.

16:12 And thou shalt remember 2142-1 that thou wast a bondman 5650 in Egypt: 4714 and thou shalt observe 8104-1 and do 6213-1 these statutes. 2706

16:13 Thou shalt observe 6213-4 the feast 2282 of tabernacles 5521 seven 7651 days, 3117 after that thou hast gathered 622-2 in thy corn 1637 and thy wine: 3342

16:14 And thou shalt rejoice 8055-1 in thy feast, 2282 thou, and thy son, 1121 and thy daughter, 1323 and thy manservant, 5650 and thy maidservant, 519 and the Levite, 3881 the stranger, 1616 and the fatherless, 3490 and the widow, 490 that [are] within thy gates. 8179

16:15 Seven 7651 days 3117 shalt thou keep a solemn feast 2287-4 unto the LORD 3068 thy God 430 in the place 4725 which the LORD 3068 shall choose: 977-4 because the LORD 3068 thy God 430 shall bless 1288-17 thee in all thine increase, 8393 and in all the works 4639 of thine hands, 3027 therefore thou shalt surely rejoice. 8056

16:16 Three 7969 times 6471 in a year 8141 shall all thy males 2138 appear 7200-11 before 6440 the LORD 3068 thy God 430 in the place 4725 which he shall choose; 977-4 in the feast 2282 of unleavened bread, 4682 and in the feast 2282 of weeks, 7620 and in the feast 2282 of tabernacles: 5521 and they shall not appear 7200-11 before 6440 the LORD 3068 empty: 7387

16:17 Every man 376 [shall give] as he is able, 4979 3027 according to the blessing 1293 of the LORD 3068 thy God 430 which he hath given 5414-1 thee.

16:18 Judges 8199-6 and officers 7860-6 shalt thou make 5414-4 thee in all thy gates, 8179 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 giveth 5414-6 thee, throughout thy tribes: 7626 and they shall judge 8199-1 the people 5971 with just 6664 judgment. 4941

16:19 Thou shalt not wrest 5186-55 judgment; 4941 thou shalt not respect 5234-55 persons, 6440 neither take 3947-4 a gift: 7810 for a gift 7810 doth blind 5786-17 the eyes 5869 of the wise, 2450 and pervert 5557-17 the words 1697 of the righteous. 6662

16:20 That which is altogether 6664 just 6664 shalt thou follow, 7291-4 that thou mayest live, 2421-4 and inherit 3423-1 the land 776 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 giveth 5414-6 thee.

16:21 Thou shalt not plant 5193-4 thee a grove 842 of any trees 6086 near unto 681 the altar 4196 of the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 which thou shalt make 6213-4 thee.

16:22 Neither shalt thou set thee up 6965-55 [any] image; 4676 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 hateth. 8130-1

17:1 Thou shalt not sacrifice 2076-4 unto the LORD 3068 thy God 430 [any] bullock, 7794 or sheep, 7716 wherein is blemish, 3971 [or] any evilfavouredness: 7451 1697 for that [is] an abomination 8441 unto the LORD 3068 thy God. 430

17:2 If there be found 4672-11 among 7130 you, within any 259 of thy gates 8179 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 giveth 5414-6 thee, man 376 or woman, 802 that hath wrought 6213-4 wickedness 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 in transgressing 5674-2 his covenant, 1285

17:3 And hath gone 3212-4 and served 5647-4 other 312 gods, 430 and worshipped 7812-101 them, either the sun, 8121 or moon, 3394 or any of the host 6635 of heaven, 8064 which I have not commanded; 6680-14

17:4 And it be told 5046-90 thee, and thou hast heard 8085-1 [of it], and enquired 1875-1 diligently, 3190-53 and, behold, [it be] true, 571 [and] the thing 1697 certain, 3559-12 [that] such abomination 8441 is wrought 6213-8 in Israel: 3478

17:5 Then shalt thou bring forth 3318-52 that man 376 or that woman, 802 which have committed 6213-1 that wicked 7451 thing, 1697 unto thy gates, 8179 [even] that man 376 or that woman, 802 and shalt stone 5619-1 them with stones, 68 till they die. 4191-1

17:6 At the mouth 6310 of two 8147 witnesses, 5707 or three 7969 witnesses, 5707 shall he that is worthy of death 4191-5 be put to death; 4191-93 [but] at the mouth 6310 of one 259 witness 5707 he shall not be put to death. 4191-93

17:7 The hands 3027 of the witnesses 5707 shall be first 7223 upon him to put him to death, 4191-53 and afterward 314 the hands 3027 of all the people. 5971 So thou shalt put the evil 7451 away 1197-14 from among 7130 you.

17:8 If there arise a matter 1697 too hard 6381-11 for thee in judgment, 4941 between blood 1818 and blood, 1818 between plea 1779 and plea, 1779 and between stroke 5061 and stroke, 5061 [being] matters 1697 of controversy 7379 within thy gates: 8179 then shalt thou arise, 6965-1 and get thee up 5927-1 into the place 4725 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 shall choose; 977-4

17:9 And thou shalt come 935-1 unto the priests 3548 the Levites, 3881 and unto the judge 8199-6 that shall be in those days, 3117 and enquire; 1875-1 and they shall shew 5046-52 thee the sentence 1697 of judgment: 4941

17:10 And thou shalt do 6213-1 according 6310 to the sentence, 1697 which they of that place 4725 which the LORD 3068 shall choose 977-4 shall shew 5046-55 thee; and thou shalt observe 8104-1 to do 6213-2 according to all that they inform 3384-55 thee:

17:11 According to the sentence 6310 of the law 8451 which they shall teach 3384-55 thee, and according to the judgment 4941 which they shall tell 559-4 thee, thou shalt do: 6213-4 thou shalt not decline 5493-4 from the sentence 1697 which they shall shew 5046-55 thee, [to] the right hand, 3225 nor [to] the left. 8040

17:12 And the man 376 that will do 6213-4 presumptuously, 2087 and will not hearken 8085-2 unto the priest 3548 that standeth 5975-6 to minister 8334-15 there before the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 or unto the judge, 8199-6 even that man 376 shall die: 4191-1 and thou shalt put away 1197-14 the evil 7451 from Israel. 3478

17:13 And all the people 5971 shall hear, 8085-4 and fear, 3372-4 and do no more presumptuously. 2102-55

17:14 When thou art come 935-4 unto the land 776 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 giveth 5414-6 thee, and shalt possess 3423-1 it, and shalt dwell 3427-1 therein, and shalt say, 559-1 I will set 7760-4 a king 4428 over me, like as all the nations 1471 that [are] about 5439 me;

17:15 Thou shalt in any wise 7760-2 set 7760-4 [him] king 4428 over thee, whom the LORD 3068 thy God 430 shall choose: 977-4 [one] from among 7130 thy brethren 251 shalt thou set 7760-4 king 4428 over thee: thou mayest 3201-4 not set 5414-2 a stranger 5237 376 over thee, which [is] not thy brother. 251

17:16 But he shall not multiply 7235-55 horses 5483 to himself, nor cause the people 5971 to return 7725-55 to Egypt, 4714 to the end that he should multiply 7235-53 horses: 5483 forasmuch as the LORD 3068 hath said 559-1 unto you, Ye shall henceforth return 7725-2 no more 3254-55 that way. 1870

17:17 Neither shall he multiply 7235-55 wives 802 to himself, that his heart 3824 turn not away: 5493-4 neither shall he greatly 3966 multiply 7235-55 to himself silver 3701 and gold. 2091

17:18 And it shall be, when he sitteth 3427-2 upon the throne 3678 of his kingdom, 4467 that he shall write 3789-1 him a copy 4932 of this law 8451 in a book 5612 out of [that which is] before 6440 the priests 3548 the Levites: 3881

17:19 And it shall be with him, and he shall read 7121-1 therein all the days 3117 of his life: 2416 that he may learn 3925-4 to fear 3372-2 the LORD 3068 his God, 430 to keep 8104-2 all the words 1697 of this law 8451 and these statutes, 2706 to do 6213-2 them:

17:20 That his heart 3824 be not lifted up 7311-2 above his brethren, 251 and that he turn not aside 5493-2 from the commandment, 4687 [to] the right hand, 3225 or [to] the left: 8040 to the end that he may prolong 748-55 [his] days 3117 in his kingdom, 4467 he, and his children, 1121 in the midst 7130 of Israel. 3478

18:1 The priests 3548 the Levites, 3881 [and] all the tribe 7626 of Levi, 3878 shall have no part 2506 nor inheritance 5159 with Israel: 3478 they shall eat 398-4 the offerings of the LORD 3068 made by fire, 801 and his inheritance. 5159

18:2 Therefore shall they have no inheritance 5159 among 7130 their brethren: 251 the LORD 3068 [is] their inheritance, 5159 as he hath said 1696-14 unto them.

18:3 And this shall be the priest's 3548 due 4941 from the people, 5971 from them that offer 2076-6 a sacrifice, 2077 whether [it be] ox 7794 or sheep; 7716 and they shall give 5414-1 unto the priest 3548 the shoulder, 2220 and the two cheeks, 3895 and the maw. 6896

18:4 The firstfruit 7225 [also] of thy corn, 1715 of thy wine, 8492 and of thine oil, 3323 and the first 7225 of the fleece 1488 of thy sheep, 6629 shalt thou give 5414-4 him.

18:5 For the LORD 3068 thy God 430 hath chosen 977-1 him out of all thy tribes, 7626 to stand 5975-2 to minister 8334-15 in the name 8034 of the LORD, 3068 him and his sons 1121 for ever. 3605 3117

18:6 And if a Levite 3881 come 935-4 from any 259 of thy gates 8179 out of all Israel, 3478 where he sojourned, 1481-6 and come 935-1 with all the desire of 185 his mind 5315 unto the place 4725 which the LORD 3068 shall choose; 977-4

18:7 Then he shall minister 8334-14 in the name 8034 of the LORD 3068 his God, 430 as all his brethren 251 the Levites 3881 [do], which stand 5975-6 there before 6440 the LORD. 3068

18:8 They shall have like portions 2506 to eat, 398-4 beside that which cometh of the sale 4465 of his patrimony. 1

18:9 When thou art come 935-6 into the land 776 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 giveth 5414-6 thee, thou shalt not learn 3925-4 to do 6213-2 after the abominations 8441 of those nations. 1471

18:10 There shall not be found 4672-11 among you [any one] that maketh his son 1121 or his daughter 1323 to pass 5674-56 through the fire, 784 [or] that useth 7080-6 divination, 7081 [or] an observer of times, 6049-26 or an enchanter, 5172-18 or a witch, 3784-18

18:11 Or a charmer, 2266-6 2267 or a consulter 7592-6 with familiar spirits, 178 or a wizard, 3049 or a necromancer. 1875-6 4191-5

18:12 For all that do 6213-6 these things [are] an abomination 8441 unto the LORD: 3068 and because 1558 of these abominations 8441 the LORD 3068 thy God 430 doth drive them out 3423-56 from before 6440 thee.

18:13 Thou shalt be perfect 8549 with the LORD 3068 thy God. 430

18:14 For these nations, 1471 which thou shalt possess, 3423-6 hearkened 8085-4 unto observers of times, 6049-26 and unto diviners: 7080-6 but as for thee, the LORD 3068 thy God 430 hath not suffered 5414-1 thee so [to do].

18:15 The LORD 3068 thy God 430 will raise up 6965-55 unto thee a Prophet 5030 from the midst 7130 of thee, of thy brethren, 251 like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken; 8085-4

18:16 According to all that thou desiredst 7592-1 of the LORD 3068 thy God 430 in Horeb 2722 in the day 3117 of the assembly, 6951 saying, 559-2 Let me not hear 8085-2 again 3254-55 the voice 6963 of the LORD 3068 my God, 430 neither let me see 7200-4 this great 1419 fire 784 any more, that I die 4191-4 not.

18:17 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto me, They have well 3190-52 [spoken that] which they have spoken. 1696-14

18:18 I will raise them up 6965-55 a Prophet 5030 from among 7130 their brethren, 251 like unto thee, and will put 5414-1 my words 1697 in his mouth; 6310 and he shall speak 1696-14 unto them all that I shall command 6680-17 him.

18:19 And it shall come to pass, [that] whosoever 376 will not hearken 8085-4 unto my words 1697 which he shall speak 1696-17 in my name, 8034 I will require 1875-4 [it] of him.

18:20 But the prophet, 5030 which shall presume 2102-55 to speak 1696-15 a word 1697 in my name, 8034 which I have not commanded 6680-14 him to speak, 1696-15 or that shall speak 1696-17 in the name 8034 of other 312 gods, 430 even that prophet 5030 shall die. 4191-1

18:21 And if thou say 559-4 in thine heart, 3824 How shall we know 3045-4 the word 1697 which the LORD 3068 hath not spoken? 1696-14

18:22 When a prophet 5030 speaketh 1696-17 in the name 8034 of the LORD, 3068 if the thing 1697 follow not, nor come to pass, 935-4 that [is] the thing 1697 which the LORD 3068 hath not spoken, 1696-14 [but] the prophet 5030 hath spoken 1696-14 it presumptuously: 2087 thou shalt not be afraid 1481-4 of him.

19:1 When the LORD 3068 thy God 430 hath cut off 3772-55 the nations, 1471 whose land 776 the LORD 3068 thy God 430 giveth 5414-6 thee, and thou succeedest 3423-1 them, and dwellest 3427-1 in their cities, 5892 and in their houses; 1004

19:2 Thou shalt separate 914-55 three 7969 cities 5892 for thee in the midst 8432 of thy land, 776 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 giveth 5414-6 thee to possess 3423-2 it.

19:3 Thou shalt prepare 3559-55 thee a way, 1870 and divide the coasts 1366 of thy land, 776 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 giveth thee to inherit, 5157-55 into three parts, 8027-14 that every slayer 7523-6 may flee 5127-2 thither.

19:4 And this [is] the case 1697 of the slayer, 7523-6 which shall flee 5127-4 thither, that he may live: 2425-1 Whoso killeth 5221-55 his neighbour 7453 ignorantly, 1097 1847 whom he hated 8130-6 not in time past; 8543 8032

19:5 As when a man goeth 935-4 into the wood 3293 with his neighbour 7453 to hew 2404-2 wood, 6086 and his hand 3027 fetcheth a stroke 5080-8 with the axe 1631 to cut down 3772-2 the tree, 6086 and the head 1270 slippeth 5394-1 from the helve, 6086 and lighteth upon 4672-1 his neighbour, 7453 that he die; 4191-1 he shall flee 5127-4 unto one 259 of those cities, 5892 and live: 2425-1

19:6 Lest the avenger 1350-6 of the blood 1818 pursue 7291-4 310 the slayer, 7523-6 while 3588 his heart 3824 is hot, 3179-4 and overtake 5381-52 him, because the way 1870 is long, 7235-4 and slay 5221-52 him; 5315 whereas he [was] not worthy 4941 of death, 4194 inasmuch as 3588 he hated 8130-6 him not in time past. 8543 8032

19:7 Wherefore I command 6680-18 thee, saying, 559-2 Thou shalt separate 914-55 three 7969 cities 5892 for thee.

19:8 And if the LORD 3068 thy God 430 enlarge 7337-55 thy coast, 1366 as he hath sworn 7650-8 unto thy fathers, 1 and give 5414-1 thee all the land 776 which he promised 1696-14 to give 5414-2 unto thy fathers; 1

19:9 If thou shalt keep 8104-4 all these commandments 4687 to do 6213-2 them, which I command 6680-18 thee this day, 3117 to love 157-2 the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 and to walk 3212-2 ever 3605 3117 in his ways; 1870 then shalt thou add 3254-1 three 7969 cities 5892 more for thee, beside these three: 7969

19:10 That innocent 5355 blood 1818 be not shed 8210-11 in 7130 thy land, 776 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 giveth 5414-6 thee [for] an inheritance, 5159 and [so] blood 1818 be upon thee.

19:11 But if any man 376 hate 8130-6 his neighbour, 7453 and lie in wait 693-1 for him, and rise up 6965-1 against him, and smite 5221-52 him mortally 5315 that he die, 4191-1 and fleeth 5127-1 into one 259 of these 411 cities: 5892

19:12 Then the elders 2205 of his city 5892 shall send 7971-1 and fetch 3947-1 him thence, and deliver 5414-1 him into the hand 3027 of the avenger 1350-6 of blood, 1818 that he may die. 4191-1

19:13 Thine eye 5869 shall not pity 2347-4 him, but thou shalt put away 1197-14 [the guilt of] innocent 5355 blood 1818 from Israel, 3478 that it may go well 2895-1 with thee.

19:14 Thou shalt not remove 5253-55 thy neighbour's 7453 landmark, 1366 which they of old time 7223 have set 1379-1 in thine inheritance, 5159 which thou shalt inherit 5157-4 in the land 776 that the LORD 3068 thy God 430 giveth 5414-6 thee to possess 3423-2 it.

19:15 One 259 witness 5707 shall not rise up 6965-4 against a man 376 for any iniquity, 5771 or for any sin, 2403 in any sin 2399 that he sinneth: 2398-4 at the mouth 6310 of two 8147 witnesses, 5707 or at the mouth 6310 of three 7969 witnesses, 5707 shall the matter 1697 be established. 6965-4

19:16 If a false 2555 witness 5707 rise up 6965-4 against any man 376 to testify 6030-2 against him [that which is] wrong; 5627

19:17 Then both 8147 the men, 582 between whom the controversy 7379 [is], shall stand 5975-1 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 before 6440 the priests 3548 and the judges, 8199-6 which shall be in those days; 3117

19:18 And the judges 8199-6 shall make diligent 3190-53 inquisition: 1875-1 and, behold, [if] the witness 5707 [be] a false 8267 witness, 5707 [and] hath testified 6030-1 falsely 8267 against his brother; 251

19:19 Then shall ye do 6213-1 unto him, as he had thought 2161-1 to have done 6213-2 unto his brother: 251 so shalt thou put the evil 7451 away 1197-14 from among 7130 you.

19:20 And those which remain 7604-12 shall hear, 8085-4 and fear, 3372-4 and shall henceforth commit 6213-2 no more 3254-55 any such 1697 evil 7451 among 7130 you.

19:21 And thine eye 5869 shall not pity; 2347-4 [but] life 5315 [shall go] for life, 5315 eye 5869 for eye, 5869 tooth 8127 for tooth, 8127 hand 3027 for hand, 3027 foot 7272 for foot. 7272

20:1 When thou goest out 3318-4 to battle 4421 against thine enemies, 341-6 and seest 7200-1 horses, 5483 and chariots, 7393 [and] a people 5971 more 7227 than thou, be not afraid 3372-4 of them: for the LORD 3068 thy God 430 [is] with thee, which brought thee up 5927-56 out of the land 776 of Egypt. 4714

20:2 And it shall be, when ye are come nigh 7126-2 unto the battle, 4421 that the priest 3548 shall approach 5066-8 and speak 1696-14 unto the people, 5971

20:3 And shall say 559-1 unto them, Hear, 8085-3 O Israel, 3478 ye approach 7131 this day 3117 unto battle 4421 against your enemies: 341-6 let not your hearts 3824 faint, 7401-11 fear 3372-4 not, and do not tremble, 2648-4 neither be ye terrified 6206-4 because 6440 of them;

20:4 For the LORD 3068 your God 430 [is] he that goeth 1980-6 with you, to fight 3898-9 for you against your enemies, 341-6 to save 3467-53 you.

20:5 And the officers 7860-6 shall speak 1696-14 unto the people, 5971 saying, 559-2 What man 376 [is there] that hath built 1129-1 a new 2319 house, 1004 and hath not dedicated 2596-1 it? let him go 3212-4 and return 7725-4 to his house, 1004 lest he die 4191-4 in the battle, 4421 and another 312 man 376 dedicate 2596-4 it.

20:6 And what man 376 [is he] that hath planted 5193-1 a vineyard, 3754 and hath not [yet] eaten 2490-14 of it? let him [also] go 3212-4 and return 7725-4 unto his house, 1004 lest he die 4191-4 in the battle, 4421 and another 312 man 376 eat 2490-17 of it.

20:7 And what man 376 [is there] that hath betrothed 781-14 a wife, 802 and hath not taken 3947-1 her? let him go 3212-4 and return 7725-4 unto his house, 1004 lest he die 4191-4 in the battle, 4421 and another 312 man 376 take 3947-4 her.

20:8 And the officers 7860-6 shall speak 1696-15 further 3254-1 unto the people, 5971 and they shall say, 559-1 What man 376 [is there that is] fearful 3373 and fainthearted? 7390 3824 let him go 3212-4 and return 7725-4 unto his house, 1004 lest his brethren's 251 heart 3824 faint 4549-11 as well as his heart. 3824

20:9 And it shall be, when the officers 7860-6 have made an end 3615-15 of speaking 1696-15 unto the people, 5971 that they shall make 6485-1 captains 8269 of the armies 6635 to lead 7218 the people. 5971

20:10 When thou comest nigh 7126-4 unto a city 5892 to fight 3898-9 against it, then proclaim 7121-1 peace 7965 unto it.

20:11 And it shall be, if it make thee answer 6030-4 of peace, 7965 and open 6605-1 unto thee, then it shall be, [that] all the people 5971 [that is] found 4672-12 therein shall be tributaries 4522 unto thee, and they shall serve 5647-1 thee.

20:12 And if it will make no peace 7999-55 with thee, but will make 6213-1 war 4421 against thee, then thou shalt besiege 6696-1 it:

20:13 And when the LORD 3068 thy God 430 hath delivered 5414-1 it into thine hands, 3027 thou shalt smite 5221-52 every male 2138 thereof with the edge 6310 of the sword: 2719

20:14 But the women, 802 and the little ones, 2945 and the cattle, 929 and all that is in the city, 5892 [even] all the spoil 7998 thereof, shalt thou take 962-4 unto thyself; and thou shalt eat 398-1 the spoil 7998 of thine enemies, 341-6 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 hath given 5414-1 thee.

20:15 Thus shalt thou do 6213-4 unto all the cities 5892 [which are] very 3966 far off 7350 from thee, which 2007 [are] not of the cities 5892 of these nations. 1471

20:16 But of the cities 5892 of these people, 5971 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 doth give 5414-6 thee [for] an inheritance, 5159 thou shalt save alive 2421-17 nothing that breatheth: 5397

20:17 But thou shalt utterly 2763-53 destroy 2763-55 them; [namely], the Hittites, 2850 and the Amorites, 567 the Canaanites, 3669 and the Perizzites, 6522 the Hivites, 2340 and the Jebusites; 2983 as the LORD 3068 thy God 430 hath commanded 6680-14 thee:

20:18 That they teach 3925-17 you not to do 6213-2 after all their abominations, 8441 which they have done 6213-1 unto their gods; 430 so should ye sin 2398-1 against the LORD 3068 your God. 430

20:19 When thou shalt besiege 6696-4 a city 5892 a long 7227 time, 3117 in making war 3898-9 against it to take 8610-2 it, thou shalt not destroy 7843-55 the trees 6086 thereof by forcing 5080-2 an axe 1631 against them: for thou mayest eat 398-4 of them, and thou shalt not cut them down 3772-4 (for the tree 6086 of the field 7704 [is] man's 120 [life]) to employ 935-2 6440 [them] in the siege: 4692

20:20 Only the trees 6086 which thou knowest 3045-4 that they [be] not trees 6086 for meat, 3978 thou shalt destroy 7843-55 and cut them down; 3772-1 and thou shalt build 1129-1 bulwarks 4692 against the city 5892 that maketh 6213-6 war 4421 with thee, until it be subdued. 3381-2

21:1 If [one] be found 4672-11 slain 2491 in the land 127 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 giveth 5414-6 thee to possess 3423-2 it, lying 5307-6 in the field, 7704 [and] it be not known 3045-8 who hath slain 5221-52 him:

21:2 Then thy elders 2205 and thy judges 8199-6 shall come forth, 3318-1 and they shall measure 4058-1 unto the cities 5892 which [are] round about 5439 him that is slain: 2491

21:3 And it shall be, [that] the city 5892 [which is] next 7138 unto the slain man, 2491 even the elders 2205 of that city 5892 shall take 3947-1 an heifer, 1241 5697 which hath not been wrought 5647-27 with, [and] which hath not drawn 4900-1 in the yoke; 5923

21:4 And the elders 2205 of that city 5892 shall bring down 3381-52 the heifer 5697 unto a rough 386 valley, 5158 which is neither eared 5647-11 nor sown, 2232-11 and shall strike off the heifer's 5697 neck 6202-1 there in the valley: 5158

21:5 And the priests 3548 the sons 1121 of Levi 3878 shall come near; 5066-8 for them the LORD 3068 thy God 430 hath chosen 977-1 to minister 8334-15 unto him, and to bless 1288-15 in the name 8034 of the LORD; 3068 and by their word 6310 shall every controversy 7379 and every stroke 5061 be [tried]:

21:6 And all the elders 2205 of that city, 5892 [that are] next 7138 unto the slain 2491 [man], shall wash 7364-4 their hands 3027 over the heifer 5697 that is beheaded 6202-7 in the valley: 5158

21:7 And they shall answer 6030-1 and say, 559-1 Our hands 3027 have not shed 8210-1 this blood, 1818 neither have our eyes 5869 seen 7200-1 [it].

21:8 Be merciful, 3722-16 O LORD, 3068 unto thy people 5971 Israel, 3478 whom thou hast redeemed, 6299-1 and lay 5414-4 not innocent 5355 blood 1818 unto thy people 5971 of Israel's 3478 charge. 7130 And the blood 1818 shall be forgiven 3722-98 them.

21:9 So shalt thou put away 1197-17 the [guilt of] innocent 5355 blood 1818 from among 7130 you, when thou shalt do 6213-4 [that which is] right 3477 in the sight 5869 of the LORD. 3068

21:10 When thou goest forth 3318-4 to war 4421 against thine enemies, 341-6 and the LORD 3068 thy God 430 hath delivered 5414-1 them into thine hands, 3027 and thou hast taken 7617-1 them captive, 7628

21:11 And seest 7200-1 among the captives 7633 a beautiful 8389 3303 woman, 802 and hast a desire 2836-1 unto her, that thou wouldest have 3947-1 her to thy wife; 802

21:12 Then thou shalt bring 935-52 her home to 8432 thine house; 1004 and she shall shave 1548-14 her head, 7218 and pare 6213-1 her nails; 6856

21:13 And she shall put 5493-52 the raiment 8071 of her captivity 7628 from off her, and shall remain 3427-1 in thine house, 1004 and bewail 1058-1 her father 1 and her mother 517 a full month: 3391 3117 and after 310 that thou shalt go in 935-4 unto her, and be her husband, 1166-1 and she shall be thy wife. 802

21:14 And it shall be, if thou have no delight 2654-1 in her, then thou shalt let her go 7971-14 whither she will; 5315 but thou shalt not sell 4376-4 her at all 4376-2 for money, 3701 thou shalt not make merchandise 6014-101 of her, because 834 thou hast humbled 6031-14 her.

21:15 If a man 376 have two 8147 wives, 802 one 259 beloved, 157-7 and another 259 hated, 8130-7 and they have born 3205-1 him children, 1121 [both] the beloved 157-7 and the hated; 8130-7 and [if] the firstborn 1060 son 1121 be hers that was hated: 8146

21:16 Then it shall be, when 3117 he maketh his sons 1121 to inherit 5157-53 [that] which he hath, [that] he may 3201-4 not make the son 1121 of the beloved 157-7 firstborn 1069-15 before 6440 the son 1121 of the hated, 8130-7 [which is indeed] the firstborn: 1060

21:17 But he shall acknowledge 5234-55 the son 1121 of the hated 8130-7 [for] the firstborn, 1060 by giving 5414-2 him a double 8147 portion 6310 of all that he hath: 4672-11 for he [is] the beginning 7225 of his strength; 202 the right 4941 of the firstborn 1062 [is] his.

21:18 If a man 376 have a stubborn 5637-6 and rebellious 4784-6 son, 1121 which will not obey 8085-6 the voice 6963 of his father, 1 or the voice 6963 of his mother, 517 and [that], when they have chastened 3256-14 him, will not hearken 8085-4 unto them:

21:19 Then shall his father 1 and his mother 517 lay hold 8610-1 on him, and bring him out 3318-52 unto the elders 2205 of his city, 5892 and unto the gate 8179 of his place; 4725

21:20 And they shall say 559-1 unto the elders 2205 of his city, 5892 This our son 1121 [is] stubborn 5637-6 and rebellious, 4784-6 he will not obey 8085-6 our voice; 6963 [he is] a glutton, 2151-6 and a drunkard. 5433-6

21:21 And all the men 582 of his city 5892 shall stone 7275-1 him with stones, 68 that he die: 4191-1 so shalt thou put evil 7451 away 1197-14 from among 7130 you; and all Israel 3478 shall hear, 8085-4 and fear. 3372-4

21:22 And if a man 376 have committed a sin 2399 worthy 4941 of death, 4194 and he be to be put to death, 4191-90 and thou hang 8518-1 him on a tree: 6086

21:23 His body 5038 shall not remain 3885-4 all night upon the tree, 6086 but thou shalt in any wise 6912-2 bury 6912-4 him that day; 3117 (for he that is hanged 8518-7 [is] accursed 7045 of God;) 430 that thy land 127 be not defiled, 2930-17 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 giveth 5414-6 thee [for] an inheritance. 5159

22:1 Thou shalt not see 7200-4 thy brother's 251 ox 7794 or his sheep 7716 go astray, 5080-12 and hide 5956-98 thyself from them: thou shalt in any case 7725-53 bring them again 7725-55 unto thy brother. 251

22:2 And if thy brother 251 [be] not nigh 7138 unto thee, or if thou know 3045-1 him not, then thou shalt bring 622-1 it unto 8432 thine own house, 1004 and it shall be with thee until thy brother 251 seek 1875-2 after it, and thou shalt restore 7725-52 it to him again.

22:3 In like manner 3651 shalt thou do 6213-4 with his ass; 2543 and so 3651 shalt thou do 6213-4 with his raiment; 8071 and 3651 with all lost thing 9 of thy brother's, 251 which he hath lost, 6-4 and thou hast found, 4672-1 shalt thou do 6213-4 likewise: thou mayest 3201-4 not hide 5956-99 thyself.

22:4 Thou shalt not see 7200-4 thy brother's 251 ass 2543 or his ox 7794 fall down 5307-6 by the way, 1870 and hide 5956-98 thyself from them: thou shalt surely 6965-53 help him to lift [them] up again. 6965-55

22:5 The woman 802 shall not wear that which pertaineth 3627 unto a man, 1397 neither shall a man 1397 put on 3847-4 a woman's 802 garment: 8071 for all that do 6213-6 so 428 [are] abomination 8441 unto the LORD 3068 thy God. 430

22:6 If a bird's 6833 nest 7064 chance 7122-11 to be before 6440 thee in the way 1870 in any tree, 6086 or on the ground, 776 [whether they be] young 667 ones, or eggs, 1000 and the dam 517 sitting 7257-6 upon the young, 667 or upon the eggs, 1000 thou shalt not take 3947-4 the dam 517 with the young: 1121

22:7 [But] thou shalt in any wise 7971-15 let the dam 517 go, 7971-17 and take 3947-4 the young 1121 to thee; that it may be well 3190-4 with thee, and [that] thou mayest prolong 748-52 [thy] days. 3117

22:8 When thou buildest 1129-4 a new 2319 house, 1004 then thou shalt make 6213-1 a battlement 4624 for thy roof, 1406 that thou bring 7760-4 not blood 1818 upon thine house, 1004 if any man 5307-6 fall 5307-4 from thence.

22:9 Thou shalt not sow 2232-4 thy vineyard 3754 with divers seeds: 3610 lest the fruit 4395 of thy seed 2233 which thou hast sown, 2232-4 and the fruit 8393 of thy vineyard, 3754 be defiled. 6942-4

22:10 Thou shalt not plow 2790-4 with an ox 7794 and an ass 2543 together. 3162

22:11 Thou shalt not wear 3847-4 a garment of divers sorts, 8162 [as] of woollen 6785 and linen 6593 together. 3162

22:12 Thou shalt make 6213-4 thee fringes 1434 upon the four 702 quarters 3671 of thy vesture, 3682 wherewith thou coverest 3680-17 [thyself].

22:13 If any man 376 take 3947-4 a wife, 802 and go in 935-1 unto her, and hate 8130-1 her,

22:14 And give 7760-1 occasions 5949 of speech 1697 against her, and bring up 3318-52 an evil 7451 name 8034 upon her, and say, 559-1 I took 3947-1 this woman, 802 and when I came 7126-4 to her, I found 4672-1 her not a maid: 1331

22:15 Then shall the father 1 of the damsel, 5291 and her mother, 517 take 3947-1 and bring forth 3318-52 [the tokens of] the damsel's 5291 virginity 1331 unto the elders 2205 of the city 5892 in the gate: 8179

22:16 And the damsel's 5291 father 1 shall say 559-1 unto the elders, 2205 I gave 5414-1 my daughter 1323 unto this man 376 to wife, 802 and he hateth 8130-4 her;

22:17 And, lo, he hath given 7760-1 occasions 5949 of speech 1697 [against her], saying, 559-2 I found 4672-1 not thy daughter 1323 a maid; 1331 and yet these [are the tokens of] my daughter's 1323 virginity. 1331 And they shall spread 6566-1 the cloth 8071 before 6440 the elders 2205 of the city. 5892

22:18 And the elders 2205 of that city 5892 shall take 3947-1 that man 376 and chastise 3256-14 him;

22:19 And they shall amerce 6064-1 him in an hundred 3967 [shekels] of silver, 3701 and give 5414-1 [them] unto the father 1 of the damsel, 5291 because he hath brought up 3318-52 an evil 7451 name 8034 upon a virgin 1330 of Israel: 3478 and she shall be his wife; 802 he may 3201-4 not put her away 7971-15 all his days. 3117

22:20 But if this thing 1697 be true, 571 [and the tokens of] virginity 1331 be not found 4672-8 for the damsel: 5291

22:21 Then they shall bring out 3318-52 the damsel 5291 to the door 6607 of her father's 1 house, 1004 and the men 582 of her city 5892 shall stone 5619-1 her with stones 68 that she die: 4191-1 because she hath wrought 6213-1 folly 5039 in Israel, 3478 to play the whore 2181-2 in her father's 1 house: 1004 so shalt thou put evil 7451 away 1197-14 from among 7130 you.

22:22 If a man 376 be found 4672-11 lying 7901-6 with a woman 802 married 1166-7 to an husband, 1167 then they shall both 8147 of them die, 4191-1 [both] the man 376 that lay 7901-6 with the woman, 802 and the woman: 802 so shalt thou put away 1197-14 evil 7451 from Israel. 3478

22:23 If a damsel 5291 [that is] a virgin 1330 be betrothed 781-30 unto an husband, 376 and a man 376 find 4672-1 her in the city, 5892 and lie 7901-1 with her;

22:24 Then ye shall bring them both 8147 out 3318-52 unto the gate 8179 of that city, 5892 and ye shall stone 5619-1 them with stones 68 that they die; 4191-1 the damsel, 5291 because 834 1697 she cried 6817-1 not, [being] in the city; 5892 and the man, 376 because 834 1697 he hath humbled 6031-14 his neighbour's 7453 wife: 802 so thou shalt put away 1197-14 evil 7451 from among 7130 you.

22:25 But if a man 376 find 4672-4 a betrothed 781-30 damsel 5291 in the field, 7704 and the man 376 force 2388-52 her, and lie 7901-1 with her: then the man 376 only that lay 7901-1 with her shall die: 4191-1

22:26 But unto the damsel 5291 thou shalt do 6213-4 nothing; 1697 [there is] in the damsel 5291 no sin 2399 [worthy] of death: 4194 for as when a man 376 riseth 6965-4 against his neighbour, 7453 and slayeth 7523-1 him, 5315 even so [is] this matter: 1697

22:27 For he found 4672-1 her in the field, 7704 [and] the betrothed 781-30 damsel 5291 cried, 6817-1 and [there was] none to save 3467-56 her.

22:28 If a man 376 find 4672-4 a damsel 5291 [that is] a virgin, 1330 which is not betrothed, 781-27 and lay hold 8610-1 on her, and lie 7901-1 with her, and they be found; 4672-8

22:29 Then the man 376 that lay 7901-6 with her shall give 5414-1 unto the damsel's 5291 father 1 fifty 2572 [shekels] of silver, 3701 and she shall be his wife; 802 because he hath humbled 6031-14 her, he may 3201-4 not put her away 7971-15 all his days. 3117

22:30 A man 376 shall not take 3947-4 his father's 1 wife, 802 nor discover 1540-17 his father's 1 skirt. 3671

23:1 He that is wounded 1795 in the stones, 6481-7 or hath his privy member 8212 cut off, 3772-7 shall not enter 935-4 into the congregation 6951 of the LORD. 3068

23:2 A bastard 4464 shall not enter 935-4 into the congregation 6951 of the LORD; 3068 even to his tenth 6224 generation 1755 shall he not enter 935-4 into the congregation 6951 of the LORD. 3068

23:3 An Ammonite 5984 or Moabite 4125 shall not enter 935-4 into the congregation 6951 of the LORD; 3068 even to their tenth 6224 generation 1755 shall they not enter 935-4 into the congregation 6951 of the LORD 3068 for 5704 ever: 5769

23:4 Because 1697 they met 6923-14 you not with bread 3899 and with water 4325 in the way, 1870 when ye came forth 3318-2 out of Egypt; 4714 and because they hired 7936-1 against thee Balaam 1109 the son 1121 of Beor 1160 of Pethor 6604 of Mesopotamia, 763 to curse 7043-15 thee.

23:5 Nevertheless the LORD 3068 thy God 430 would 14-1 not hearken 8085-2 unto Balaam; 1109 but the LORD 3068 thy God 430 turned 2015-4 the curse 7045 into a blessing 1293 unto thee, because the LORD 3068 thy God 430 loved 157-1 thee.

23:6 Thou shalt not seek 1875-4 their peace 7965 nor their prosperity 2896 all thy days 3117 for ever. 5769

23:7 Thou shalt not abhor 8581-17 an Edomite; 130 for he [is] thy brother: 251 thou shalt not abhor 8581-17 an Egyptian; 4713 because thou wast a stranger 1616 in his land. 776

23:8 The children 1121 that are begotten 3205-11 of them shall enter 935-4 into the congregation 6951 of the LORD 3068 in their third 7992 generation. 1755

23:9 When the host 4264 goeth forth 3318-4 against thine enemies, 341-6 then keep 8104-8 thee from every wicked 7451 thing. 1697

23:10 If there be among you any man, 376 that is not clean 2889 by reason of uncleanness that chanceth 7137 him by night, 3915 then shall he go 3318-1 abroad 2351 out of the camp, 4264 he shall not come 935-4 within 8432 the camp: 4264

23:11 But it shall be, when evening 6153 cometh on, 6437-2 he shall wash 7364-4 [himself] with water: 4325 and when the sun 8121 is down, 935-2 he shall come 935-4 into 8432 the camp 4264 [again].

23:12 Thou shalt have a place also 3027 without 2351 the camp, 4264 whither thou shalt go forth 3318-1 abroad: 2351

23:13 And thou shalt have a paddle 3489 upon thy weapon; 240 and it shall be, when thou wilt ease 3427-2 thyself abroad, 2351 thou shalt dig 2658-1 therewith, and shalt turn back 7725-1 and cover 3680-14 that which cometh 6627 from thee:

23:14 For the LORD 3068 thy God 430 walketh 1980-102 in the midst 7130 of thy camp, 4264 to deliver 5337-53 thee, and to give up 5414-2 thine enemies 341-6 before 6440 thee; therefore shall thy camp 4264 be holy: 6918 that he see 7200-4 no unclean 6172 thing 1697 in thee, and turn away 7725-1 from thee. 310

23:15 Thou shalt not deliver 5462-55 unto his master 113 the servant 5650 which is escaped 5337-11 from his master 113 unto thee:

23:16 He shall dwell 3427-4 with thee, [even] among 7130 you, in that place 4725 which he shall choose 977-4 in one 259 of thy gates, 8179 where it liketh him best: 2896 thou shalt not oppress 3238-55 him.

23:17 There shall be no whore 6948 of the daughters 1323 of Israel, 3478 nor a sodomite 6945 of the sons 1121 of Israel. 3478

23:18 Thou shalt not bring 935-55 the hire 868 of a whore, 2181-6 or the price 4242 of a dog, 3611 into the house 1004 of the LORD 3068 thy God 430 for any vow: 5088 for even both 8147 these [are] abomination 8441 unto the LORD 3068 thy God. 430

23:19 Thou shalt not lend upon usury 5391-55 to thy brother; 251 usury 5392 of money, 3701 usury 5392 of victuals, 400 usury 5392 of any thing 1697 that is lent upon usury: 5391-4

23:20 Unto a stranger 5237 thou mayest lend upon usury; 5391-55 but unto thy brother 251 thou shalt not lend upon usury: 5391-55 that the LORD 3068 thy God 430 may bless 1288-17 thee in all that thou settest 4916 thine hand 3027 to in the land 776 whither thou goest 935-6 to possess 3423-2 it.

23:21 When thou shalt vow 5087-4 a vow 5088 unto the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 thou shalt not slack 309-17 to pay 7999-15 it: for the LORD 3068 thy God 430 will surely 1875-2 require 1875-4 it of thee; and it would be sin 2399 in thee.

23:22 But if thou shalt forbear 2308-4 to vow, 5087-2 it shall be no sin 2399 in thee.

23:23 That which is gone out 4161 of thy lips 8193 thou shalt keep 8104-4 and perform; 6213-1 [even] a freewill offering, 5071 according as thou hast vowed 5087-1 unto the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 which thou hast promised 1696-14 with thy mouth. 6310

23:24 When thou comest 935-4 into thy neighbour's 7453 vineyard, 3754 then thou mayest eat 398-1 grapes 6025 thy fill 7648 at thine own pleasure; 5315 but thou shalt not put 5414-4 [any] in thy vessel. 3627

23:25 When thou comest 935-4 into the standing corn 7054 of thy neighbour, 7453 then thou mayest pluck 6998-1 the ears 4425 with thine hand; 3027 but thou shalt not move 5130-55 a sickle 2770 unto thy neighbour's 7453 standing corn. 7054

24:1 When a man 376 hath taken 3947-4 a wife, 802 and married 1166-1 her, and it come to pass that she find 4672-4 no favour 2580 in his eyes, 5869 because he hath found 4672-1 some 1697 uncleanness 6172 in her: then let him write 3789-1 her a bill 5612 of divorcement, 3748 and give 5414-1 [it] in her hand, 3027 and send 7971-14 her out of his house. 1004

24:2 And when she is departed 3318-1 out of his house, 1004 she may go 1980-1 and be another 312 man's 376 [wife].

24:3 And [if] the latter 314 husband 376 hate 8130-1 her, and write 3789-1 her a bill 5612 of divorcement, 3748 and giveth 5414-1 [it] in her hand, 3027 and sendeth 7971-14 her out of his house; 1004 or if the latter 314 husband 376 die, 4191-4 which took 3947-1 her [to be] his wife; 802

24:4 Her former 7223 husband, 1167 which sent her away, 7971-14 may 3201-4 not take 3947-2 her again 7725-2 to be his wife, 802 after 310 that she is defiled; 2930-120 for that [is] abomination 8441 before 6440 the LORD: 3068 and thou shalt not cause the land 776 to sin, 2398-55 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 giveth 5414-6 thee [for] an inheritance. 5159

24:5 When a man 376 hath taken 3947-4 a new 2319 wife, 802 he shall not go out 3318-4 to war, 6635 neither shall he be charged 5674-4 with any business: 1697 [but] he shall be free 5355 at home 1004 one 259 year, 8141 and shall cheer up 8055-14 his wife 802 which he hath taken. 3947-1

24:6 No man shall take the nether 7347 or the upper millstone 7393 to pledge: 2254-4 for he taketh [a man's] life 5315 to pledge. 2254-6

24:7 If a man 376 be found 4672-11 stealing 1589-6 any 5315 of his brethren 251 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and maketh merchandise 6014-98 of him, or selleth 4376-1 him; then that thief 1590 shall die; 4191-1 and thou shalt put evil 7451 away 1197-14 from among 7130 you.

24:8 Take heed 8104-10 in the plague 5061 of leprosy, 6883 that thou observe 8104-2 diligently, 3966 and do 6213-2 according to all that the priests 3548 the Levites 3881 shall teach 3384-55 you: as I commanded 6680-14 them, [so] ye shall observe 8104-4 to do. 6213-2

24:9 Remember 2142-2 what the LORD 3068 thy God 430 did 6213-1 unto Miriam 4813 by the way, 1870 after that ye were come forth 3318-2 out of Egypt. 4714

24:10 When thou dost lend 5383-55 thy brother 7453 any 4859 thing, 3972 thou shalt not go 935-4 into his house 1004 to fetch 5670-2 his pledge. 5667

24:11 Thou shalt stand 5975-4 abroad, 2351 and the man 376 to whom thou dost lend 5383-6 shall bring out 3318-55 the pledge 5667 abroad 2351 unto thee.

24:12 And if the man 376 [be] poor, 6041 thou shalt not sleep 7901-4 with his pledge: 5667

24:13 In any case 7725-53 thou shalt deliver him the pledge 5667 again 7725-55 when the sun 8121 goeth down, 935-2 that he may sleep 7901-1 in his own raiment, 8008 and bless 1288-14 thee: and it shall be righteousness 6666 unto thee before 6440 the LORD 3068 thy God. 430

24:14 Thou shalt not oppress 6231-4 an hired servant 7916 [that is] poor 6041 and needy, 34 [whether he be] of thy brethren, 251 or of thy strangers 1616 that [are] in thy land 776 within thy gates: 8179

24:15 At his day 3117 thou shalt give 5414-4 [him] his hire, 7939 neither shall the sun 8121 go down 935-4 upon it; for he [is] poor, 6041 and setteth 5375-6 his heart 5315 upon it: lest he cry 7121-4 against thee unto the LORD, 3068 and it be sin 2399 unto thee.

24:16 The fathers 1 shall not be put to death 4191-93 for the children, 1121 neither shall the children 1121 be put to death 4191-93 for the fathers: 1 every man 376 shall be put to death 4191-93 for his own sin. 2399

24:17 Thou shalt not pervert 5186-55 the judgment 4941 of the stranger, 1616 [nor] of the fatherless; 3490 nor take a widow's 490 raiment 899 to pledge: 2254-4

24:18 But thou shalt remember 2142-1 that thou wast a bondman 5650 in Egypt, 4714 and the LORD 3068 thy God 430 redeemed 6299-4 thee thence: therefore I command 6680-18 thee to do 6213-2 this thing. 1697

24:19 When thou cuttest down 7114-4 thine harvest 7105 in thy field, 7704 and hast forgot 7911-1 a sheaf 6016 in the field, 7704 thou shalt not go again 7725-4 to fetch 3947-2 it: it shall be for the stranger, 1616 for the fatherless, 3490 and for the widow: 490 that the LORD 3068 thy God 430 may bless 1288-17 thee in all the work 4639 of thine hands. 3027

24:20 When thou beatest 2251-4 thine olive tree, 2132 thou shalt not go over the boughs 6286-17 again: 310 it shall be for the stranger, 1616 for the fatherless, 3490 and for the widow. 490

24:21 When thou gatherest 1219-4 the grapes of thy vineyard, 3754 thou shalt not glean 5953-25 [it] afterward: 310 it shall be for the stranger, 1616 for the fatherless, 3490 and for the widow. 490

24:22 And thou shalt remember 2142-1 that thou wast a bondman 5650 in the land 776 of Egypt: 4714 therefore I command 6680-18 thee to do 6213-2 this thing. 1697

25:1 If there be a controversy 7379 between men, 582 and they come 5066-8 unto judgment, 4941 that [the judges] may judge 8199-1 them; then they shall justify 6663-52 the righteous, 6662 and condemn 7561-52 the wicked. 7563

25:2 And it shall be, if the wicked 7563 man [be] worthy 1121 to be beaten, 5221-53 that the judge 8199-6 shall cause him to lie down, 5307-52 and to be beaten 5221-52 before his face, 6440 according 1767 to his fault, 7564 by a certain number. 4557

25:3 Forty 705 stripes 5221-55 he may give him, [and] not exceed: 3254-55 lest, [if] he should exceed, 3254-55 and beat 5221-53 him above these with many 7227 stripes, 4347 then thy brother 251 should seem vile 7034-8 unto thee. 5869

25:4 Thou shalt not muzzle 2629-4 the ox 7794 when he treadeth out 1758-2 [the corn].

25:5 If brethren 251 dwell 3427-4 together, 3162 and one 259 of them die, 4191-1 and have no child, 1121 the wife 802 of the dead 4191-5 shall not marry without 2351 unto a stranger: 376 2114-5 her husband's brother 2993 shall go in 935-4 unto her, and take 3947-1 her to him to wife, 802 and perform the duty of an husband's brother 2992-17 unto her.

25:6 And it shall be, [that] the firstborn 1060 which she beareth 3205-4 shall succeed 6965-4 in the name 8034 of his brother 251 [which is] dead, 4191-5 that his name 8034 be not put out 4229-11 of Israel. 3478

25:7 And if the man 376 like 2654-4 not to take 3947-2 his brother's wife, 2994 then let his brother's wife 2994 go up 5927-1 to the gate 8179 unto the elders, 2205 and say, 559-1 My husband's brother 2993 refuseth 3985-14 to raise up 6965-53 unto his brother 251 a name 8034 in Israel, 3478 he will 14-1 not perform the duty of my husband's brother. 2992-15

25:8 Then the elders 2205 of his city 5892 shall call 7121-1 him, and speak 1696-14 unto him: and [if] he stand 5975-1 [to it], and say, 559-1 I like 2654-1 not to take 3947-2 her;

25:9 Then shall his brother's wife 2994 come 5066-8 unto him in the presence 5869 of the elders, 2205 and loose 2502-1 his shoe 5275 from off his foot, 7272 and spit 3417-1 in his face, 6440 and shall answer 6030-1 and say, 559-1 So shall it be done 6213-11 unto that man 376 that will not build up 1129-4 his brother's 251 house. 1004

25:10 And his name 8034 shall be called 7121-8 in Israel, 3478 The house 1004 of him that hath his shoe 5275 loosed. 2502-7

25:11 When men 582 strive 5327-11 together 3162 one 376 with another, 251 and the wife 802 of the one 259 draweth near 7126-1 for to deliver 5337-53 her husband 376 out of the hand 3027 of him that smiteth 5221-56 him, and putteth forth 7971-1 her hand, 3027 and taketh 2388-52 him by the secrets: 4016

25:12 Then thou shalt cut off 7112-1 her hand, 3709 thine eye 5869 shall not pity 2347-4 [her].

25:13 Thou shalt not have in thy bag 3599 divers weights, 68 68 a great 1419 and a small. 6996

25:14 Thou shalt not have in thine house 1004 divers measures, 374 374 a great 1419 and a small. 6996

25:15 [But] thou shalt have a perfect 8003 and just 6664 weight, 68 a perfect 8003 and just 6664 measure 374 shalt thou have: that thy days 3117 may be lengthened 748-55 in the land 127 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 giveth 5414-6 thee.

25:16 For all that do 6213-6 such 428 things, [and] all that do 6213-6 unrighteously, 5766 [are] an abomination 8441 unto the LORD 3068 thy God. 430

25:17 Remember 2142-2 what Amalek 6002 did 6213-1 unto thee by the way, 1870 when ye were come forth 3318-2 out of Egypt; 4714

25:18 How he met 7136-1 thee by the way, 1870 and smote the hindmost 2179-17 of thee, [even] all [that were] feeble 2826-12 behind 310 thee, when thou [wast] faint 5889 and weary; 3023 and he feared 3373 not God. 430

25:19 Therefore it shall be, when the LORD 3068 thy God 430 hath given thee rest 5117-53 from all thine enemies 341-6 round about, 5439 in the land 776 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 giveth 5414-6 thee [for] an inheritance 5159 to possess 3423-2 it, [that] thou shalt blot out 4229-4 the remembrance 2143 of Amalek 6002 from under heaven; 8064 thou shalt not forget 7911-4 [it].

26:1 And it shall be, when thou [art] come 935-4 in unto the land 776 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 giveth 5414-6 thee [for] an inheritance, 5159 and possessest 3423-1 it, and dwellest 3427-1 therein;

26:2 That thou shalt take 3947-1 of the first 7225 of all the fruit 6529 of the earth, 127 which thou shalt bring 935-55 of thy land 776 that the LORD 3068 thy God 430 giveth 5414-6 thee, and shalt put 7760-1 [it] in a basket, 2935 and shalt go 1980-1 unto the place 4725 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 shall choose 977-4 to place 7931-15 his name 8034 there.

26:3 And thou shalt go 935-1 unto the priest 3548 that shall be in those days, 3117 and say 559-1 unto him, I profess 5046-52 this day 3117 unto the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 that I am come 935-1 unto the country 776 which the LORD 3068 sware 7650-8 unto our fathers 1 for to give 5414-2 us.

26:4 And the priest 3548 shall take 3947-1 the basket 2935 out of thine hand, 3027 and set it down 3240-52 before 6440 the altar 4196 of the LORD 3068 thy God. 430

26:5 And thou shalt speak 6030-1 and say 559-1 before 6440 the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 A Syrian 761 ready to perish 6-6 [was] my father, 1 and he went down 3381-4 into Egypt, 4714 and sojourned 1481-4 there with a few, 4592 4962 and became there a nation, 1471 great, 1419 mighty, 6099 and populous: 7227

26:6 And the Egyptians 4713 evil entreated 7489-55 us, and afflicted 6031-17 us, and laid 5414-4 upon us hard 7186 bondage: 5656

26:7 And when we cried 6817-4 unto the LORD 3068 God 430 of our fathers, 1 the LORD 3068 heard 8085-4 our voice, 6963 and looked 7200-4 on our affliction, 6040 and our labour, 5999 and our oppression: 3906

26:8 And the LORD 3068 brought us forth 3318-55 out of Egypt 4714 with a mighty 2389 hand, 3027 and with an outstretched 5186-7 arm, 2220 and with great 1419 terribleness, 4172 and with signs, 226 and with wonders: 4159

26:9 And he hath brought 935-55 us into this place, 4725 and hath given 5414-4 us this land, 776 [even] a land 776 that floweth 2100-6 with milk 2461 and honey. 1706

26:10 And now, behold, I have brought 935-52 the firstfruits 6529 7225 of the land, 127 which thou, O LORD, 3068 hast given 5414-1 me. And thou shalt set 3240-52 it before 6440 the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 and worship 7812-98 before 6440 the LORD 3068 thy God: 430

26:11 And thou shalt rejoice 8055-1 in every good 2896 [thing] which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 hath given 5414-1 unto thee, and unto thine house, 1004 thou, and the Levite, 3881 and the stranger 1616 that [is] among 7130 you.

26:12 When thou hast made an end 3615-17 of tithing 6237-53 all the tithes 4643 of thine increase 8393 the third 7992 year, 8141 [which is] the year 8141 of tithing, 4643 and hast given 5414-1 [it] unto the Levite, 3881 the stranger, 1616 the fatherless, 3490 and the widow, 490 that they may eat 398-1 within thy gates, 8179 and be filled; 7646-1

26:13 Then thou shalt say 559-1 before 6440 the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 I have brought away 1197-14 the hallowed things 6944 out of [mine] house, 1004 and also have given 5414-1 them unto the Levite, 3881 and unto the stranger, 1616 to the fatherless, 3490 and to the widow, 490 according to all thy commandments 4687 which thou hast commanded 6680-14 me: I have not transgressed 5674-1 thy commandments, 4687 neither have I forgotten 7911-1 [them]:

26:14 I have not eaten 398-1 thereof in my mourning, 205 neither have I taken away 1197-14 [ought] thereof for [any] unclean 2931 [use], nor given 5414-1 [ought] thereof for the dead: 4191-5 [but] I have hearkened 8085-1 to the voice 6963 of the LORD 3068 my God, 430 [and] have done 6213-1 according to all that thou hast commanded 6680-14 me.

26:15 Look down 8259-54 from thy holy 6944 habitation, 4583 from heaven, 8064 and bless 1288-16 thy people 5971 Israel, 3478 and the land 127 which thou hast given 5414-1 us, as thou swarest 7650-8 unto our fathers, 1 a land 776 that floweth 2100-6 with milk 2461 and honey. 1706

26:16 This day 3117 the LORD 3068 thy God 430 hath commanded 6680-18 thee to do 6213-2 these statutes 2706 and judgments: 4941 thou shalt therefore keep 8104-1 and do 6213-1 them with all thine heart, 3824 and with all thy soul. 5315

26:17 Thou hast avouched 559-52 the LORD 3068 this day 3117 to be thy God, 430 and to walk 3212-2 in his ways, 1870 and to keep 8104-2 his statutes, 2706 and his commandments, 4687 and his judgments, 4941 and to hearken 8085-2 unto his voice: 6963

26:18 And the LORD 3068 hath avouched 559-52 thee this day 3117 to be his peculiar 5459 people, 5971 as he hath promised 1696-14 thee, and that [thou] shouldest keep 8104-2 all his commandments; 4687

26:19 And to make 5414-2 thee high 5945 above all nations 1471 which he hath made, 6213-1 in praise, 8416 and in name, 8034 and in honour; 8597 and that thou mayest be an holy 6918 people 5971 unto the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 as he hath spoken. 1696-14

27:1 And Moses 4872 with the elders 2205 of Israel 3478 commanded 6680-17 the people, 5971 saying, 559-2 Keep 8104-2 all the commandments 4687 which I command 6680-18 you this day. 3117

27:2 And it shall be on the day 3117 when ye shall pass over 5674-4 Jordan 3383 unto the land 776 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 giveth 5414-6 thee, that thou shalt set thee up 6965-52 great 1419 stones, 68 and plaister 7874-1 them with plaister: 7875

27:3 And thou shalt write 3789-1 upon them all the words 1697 of this law, 8451 when thou art passed over, 5674-2 that thou mayest go in 935-4 unto the land 776 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 giveth 5414-6 thee, a land 776 that floweth 2100-6 with milk 2461 and honey; 1706 as the LORD 3068 God 430 of thy fathers 1 hath promised 1696-14 thee.

27:4 Therefore it shall be when ye be gone over 5674-2 Jordan, 3383 [that] ye shall set up 6965-55 these stones, 68 which I command 6680-18 you this day, 3117 in mount 2022 Ebal, 5858 and thou shalt plaister 7874-1 them with plaister. 7875

27:5 And there shalt thou build 1129-1 an altar 4196 unto the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 an altar 4196 of stones: 68 thou shalt not lift up 5130-55 [any] iron 1270 [tool] upon them.

27:6 Thou shalt build 1129-4 the altar 4196 of the LORD 3068 thy God 430 of whole 8003 stones: 68 and thou shalt offer 5927-52 burnt offerings 5930 thereon unto the LORD 3068 thy God: 430

27:7 And thou shalt offer 2076-1 peace offerings, 8002 and shalt eat 398-1 there, and rejoice 8055-1 before 6440 the LORD 3068 thy God. 430

27:8 And thou shalt write 3789-1 upon the stones 68 all the words 1697 of this law 8451 very 3190-53 plainly. 874-16

27:9 And Moses 4872 and the priests 3548 the Levites 3881 spake 1696-17 unto all Israel, 3478 saying, 559-2 Take heed, 5535-54 and hearken, 8085-3 O Israel; 3478 this day 3117 thou art become 1961-8 the people 5971 of the LORD 3068 thy God. 430

27:10 Thou shalt therefore obey 8085-1 the voice 6963 of the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 and do 6213-1 his commandments 4687 and his statutes, 2706 which I command 6680-18 thee this day. 3117

27:11 And Moses 4872 charged 6680-17 the people 5971 the same day, 3117 saying, 559-2

27:12 These shall stand 5975-4 upon mount 2022 Gerizim 1630 to bless 1288-15 the people, 5971 when ye are come over 5674-2 Jordan; 3383 Simeon, 8095 and Levi, 3878 and Judah, 3063 and Issachar, 3485 and Joseph, 3130 and Benjamin: 1144

27:13 And these shall stand 5975-4 upon mount 2022 Ebal 5858 to curse; 7045 Reuben, 7205 Gad, 1410 and Asher, 836 and Zebulun, 2074 Dan, 1835 and Naphtali. 5321

27:14 And the Levites 3881 shall speak, 6030-1 and say 559-1 unto all the men 376 of Israel 3478 with a loud 7311-6 voice, 6963

27:15 Cursed 779-7 [be] the man 376 that maketh 6213-4 [any] graven 6459 or molten image, 4541 an abomination 8441 unto the LORD, 3068 the work 4639 of the hands 3027 of the craftsman, 2796 and putteth 7760-1 [it] in [a] secret 5643 [place]. And all the people 5971 shall answer 6030-1 and say, 559-1 Amen. 543

27:16 Cursed 779-7 [be] he that setteth light 7034-56 by his father 1 or his mother. 517 And all the people 5971 shall say, 559-1 Amen. 543

27:17 Cursed 779-7 [be] he that removeth 5253-56 his neighbour's 7453 landmark. 1366 And all the people 5971 shall say, 559-1 Amen. 543

27:18 Cursed 779-7 [be] he that maketh the blind 5787 to wander 7686-56 out of the way. 1870 And all the people 5971 shall say, 559-1 Amen. 543

27:19 Cursed 779-7 [be] he that perverteth 5186-56 the judgment 4941 of the stranger, 1616 fatherless, 3490 and widow. 490 And all the people 5971 shall say, 559-1 Amen. 543

27:20 Cursed 779-7 [be] he that lieth 7901-6 with his father's 1 wife; 802 because he uncovereth 1540-14 his father's 1 skirt. 3671 And all the people 5971 shall say, 559-1 Amen. 543

27:21 Cursed 779-7 [be] he that lieth 7901-6 with any manner of beast. 929 And all the people 5971 shall say, 559-1 Amen. 543

27:22 Cursed 779-7 [be] he that lieth 7901-6 with his sister, 269 the daughter 1323 of his father, 1 or the daughter 1323 of his mother. 517 And all the people 5971 shall say, 559-1 Amen. 543

27:23 Cursed 779-7 [be] he that lieth 7901-6 with his mother in law. 2859-6 And all the people 5971 shall say, 559-1 Amen. 543

27:24 Cursed 779-7 [be] he that smiteth 5221-56 his neighbour 7453 secretly. 5643 And all the people 5971 shall say, 559-1 Amen. 543

27:25 Cursed 779-7 [be] he that taketh 3947-6 reward 7810 to slay 5221-53 an innocent 5355 1818 person. 5315 And all the people 5971 shall say, 559-1 Amen. 543

27:26 Cursed 779-7 [be] he that confirmeth 6965-55 not [all] the words 1697 of this law 8451 to do 6213-2 them. And all the people 5971 shall say, 559-1 Amen. 543

28:1 And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken 8085-4 diligently 8085-2 unto the voice 6963 of the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 to observe 8104-2 [and] to do 6213-2 all his commandments 4687 which I command 6680-18 thee this day, 3117 that the LORD 3068 thy God 430 will set 5414-1 thee on high 5945 above all nations 1471 of the earth: 776

28:2 And all these blessings 1293 shall come 935-1 on thee, and overtake 5381-52 thee, if thou shalt hearken 8085-4 unto the voice 6963 of the LORD 3068 thy God. 430

28:3 Blessed 1288-7 [shalt] thou [be] in the city, 5892 and blessed 1288-7 [shalt] thou [be] in the field. 7704

28:4 Blessed 1288-7 [shall be] the fruit 6529 of thy body, 990 and the fruit 6529 of thy ground, 127 and the fruit 6529 of thy cattle, 929 the increase 7698 of thy kine, 504 and the flocks 6251 of thy sheep. 6629

28:5 Blessed 1288-7 [shall be] thy basket 2935 and thy store. 4863

28:6 Blessed 1288-7 [shalt] thou [be] when thou comest in, 935-2 and blessed 1288-7 [shalt] thou [be] when thou goest out. 3318-2

28:7 The LORD 3068 shall cause 5414-4 thine enemies 341-6 that rise up 6965-5 against thee to be smitten 5062-12 before thy face: 6440 they shall come out 3318-4 against thee one 259 way, 1870 and flee 5127-4 before 6440 thee seven 7651 ways. 1870

28:8 The LORD 3068 shall command 6680-17 the blessing 1293 upon thee in thy storehouses, 618 and in all that thou settest 4916 thine hand 3027 unto; and he shall bless 1288-14 thee in the land 776 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 giveth 5414-6 thee.

28:9 The LORD 3068 shall establish 6965-55 thee an holy 6918 people 5971 unto himself, as he hath sworn 7650-8 unto thee, if thou shalt keep 8104-4 the commandments 4687 of the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 and walk 1980-1 in his ways. 1870

28:10 And all people 5971 of the earth 776 shall see 7200-1 that thou art called 7121-8 by the name 8034 of the LORD; 3068 and they shall be afraid 3372-1 of thee.

28:11 And the LORD 3068 shall make thee plenteous 3498-52 in goods, 2896 in the fruit 6529 of thy body, 990 and in the fruit 6529 of thy cattle, 929 and in the fruit 6529 of thy ground, 127 in the land 127 which the LORD 3068 sware 7650-8 unto thy fathers 1 to give 5414-2 thee.

28:12 The LORD 3068 shall open 6605-4 unto thee his good 2896 treasure, 214 the heaven 8064 to give 5414-2 the rain 4306 unto thy land 776 in his season, 6256 and to bless 1288-15 all the work 4639 of thine hand: 3027 and thou shalt lend 3867-52 unto many 7227 nations, 1471 and thou shalt not borrow. 3867-4

28:13 And the LORD 3068 shall make 5414-1 thee the head, 7218 and not the tail; 2180 and thou shalt be above 4605 only, and thou shalt not be beneath; 4295 if that thou hearken 8085-4 unto the commandments 4687 of the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 which I command 6680-18 thee this day, 3117 to observe 8104-2 and to do 6213-2 [them]:

28:14 And thou shalt not go aside 5493-4 from any of the words 1697 which I command 6680-18 thee this day, 3117 [to] the right hand, 3225 or [to] the left, 8040 to go 3212-2 after 310 other 312 gods 430 to serve 5647-2 them.

28:15 But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken 8085-4 unto the voice 6963 of the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 to observe 8104-2 to do 6213-2 all his commandments 4687 and his statutes 2708 which I command 6680-18 thee this day; 3117 that all these curses 7045 shall come 935-1 upon thee, and overtake 5381-52 thee:

28:16 Cursed 779-7 [shalt] thou [be] in the city, 5892 and cursed 779-7 [shalt] thou [be] in the field. 7704

28:17 Cursed 779-7 [shall be] thy basket 2935 and thy store. 4863

28:18 Cursed 779-7 [shall be] the fruit 6529 of thy body, 990 and the fruit 6529 of thy land, 127 the increase 7698 of thy kine, 504 and the flocks 6251 of thy sheep. 6629

28:19 Cursed 779-7 [shalt] thou [be] when thou comest in, 935-2 and cursed 779-7 [shalt] thou [be] when thou goest out. 3318-2

28:20 The LORD 3068 shall send 7971-17 upon thee cursing, 3994 vexation, 4103 and rebuke, 4045 in all that thou settest 4916 thine hand 3027 unto for to do, 6213-4 until thou be destroyed, 8045-9 and until thou perish 6-2 quickly; 4118 because 6440 of the wickedness 7455 of thy doings, 4611 whereby thou hast forsaken 5800-1 me.

28:21 The LORD 3068 shall make the pestilence 1698 cleave 1692-55 unto thee, until he have consumed 3615-15 thee from off the land, 127 whither thou goest 935-6 to possess 3423-2 it.

28:22 The LORD 3068 shall smite 5221-55 thee with a consumption, 7829 and with a fever, 6920 and with an inflammation, 1816 and with an extreme burning, 2746 and with the sword, 2719 and with blasting, 7711 and with mildew; 3420 and they shall pursue 7291-1 thee until thou perish. 6-2

28:23 And thy heaven 8064 that [is] over thy head 7218 shall be brass, 5178 and the earth 776 that is under thee [shall be] iron. 1270

28:24 The LORD 3068 shall make 5414-4 the rain 4306 of thy land 776 powder 80 and dust: 6083 from heaven 8064 shall it come down 3381-4 upon thee, until thou be destroyed. 8045-9

28:25 The LORD 3068 shall cause 5414-4 thee to be smitten 5062-12 before 6440 thine enemies: 341-6 thou shalt go out 3318-4 one 259 way 1870 against them, and flee 5127-4 seven 7651 ways 1870 before 6440 them: and shalt be removed 2189 into all the kingdoms 4467 of the earth. 776

28:26 And thy carcase 5038 shall be meat 3978 unto all fowls 5775 of the air, 8064 and unto the beasts 929 of the earth, 776 and no man shall fray [them] away. 2729-56

28:27 The LORD 3068 will smite 5221-55 thee with the botch 7822 of Egypt, 4714 and with the emerods, 2914|6076-k and with the scab, 1618 and with the itch, 2775 whereof thou canst 3201-4 not be healed. 7495-9

28:28 The LORD 3068 shall smite 5221-55 thee with madness, 7697 and blindness, 5788 and astonishment 8541 of heart: 3824

28:29 And thou shalt grope 4959-18 at noonday, 6672 as the blind 5787 gropeth 4959-17 in darkness, 653 and thou shalt not prosper 6743-55 in thy ways: 1870 and thou shalt be only oppressed 6231-7 and spoiled 1497-7 evermore, 3605 3117 and no man shall save 3467-56 [thee].

28:30 Thou shalt betroth 781-17 a wife, 802 and another 312 man 376 shall lie 7901-4|7693-4-k with her: thou shalt build 1129-4 an house, 1004 and thou shalt not dwell 3427-4 therein: thou shalt plant 5193-4 a vineyard, 3754 and shalt not gather the grapes 2490-17 thereof.

28:31 Thine ox 7794 [shall be] slain 2873-7 before thine eyes, 5869 and thou shalt not eat 398-4 thereof: thine ass 2543 [shall be] violently taken away 1497-7 from before thy face, 6440 and shall not be restored 7725-4 to thee: thy sheep 6629 [shall be] given 5414-7 unto thine enemies, 341-6 and thou shalt have none to rescue 3467-56 [them].

28:32 Thy sons 1121 and thy daughters 1323 [shall be] given 5414-7 unto another 312 people, 5971 and thine eyes 5869 shall look, 7200-6 and fail 3616 [with longing] for them all the day 3117 long: and [there shall be] no might 410 in thine hand. 3027

28:33 The fruit 6529 of thy land, 127 and all thy labours, 3018 shall a nation 5971 which thou knowest 3045-1 not eat 398-4 up; and thou shalt be only oppressed 6231-7 and crushed 7533-7 alway: 3605 3117

28:34 So that thou shalt be mad 7696-30 for the sight 4758 of thine eyes 5869 which thou shalt see. 7200-4

28:35 The LORD 3068 shall smite 5221-55 thee in the knees, 1290 and in the legs, 7785 with a sore 7451 botch 7822 that cannot 3808 3201-4 be healed, 7495-9 from the sole 3709 of thy foot 7272 unto the top of thy head. 6936

28:36 The LORD 3068 shall bring 3212-55 thee, and thy king 4428 which thou shalt set 6965-55 over thee, unto a nation 1471 which neither thou nor thy fathers 1 have known; 3045-1 and there shalt thou serve 5647-1 other 312 gods, 430 wood 6086 and stone. 68

28:37 And thou shalt become an astonishment, 8047 a proverb, 4912 and a byword, 8148 among all nations 5971 whither the LORD 3068 shall lead 5090-17 thee.

28:38 Thou shalt carry much 7227 seed 2233 out 3318-55 into the field, 7704 and shalt gather 622-4 [but] little 4592 in; for the locust 697 shall consume 2628-4 it.

28:39 Thou shalt plant 5193-4 vineyards, 3754 and dress 5647-1 [them], but shalt neither drink 8354-4 [of] the wine, 3196 nor gather 103-4 [the grapes]; for the worms 8438 shall eat 398-4 them.

28:40 Thou shalt have olive trees 2132 throughout all thy coasts, 1366 but thou shalt not anoint 5480-4 [thyself] with the oil; 8081 for thine olive 2132 shall cast 5394-4 [his fruit].

28:41 Thou shalt beget 3205-55 sons 1121 and daughters, 1323 but thou shalt not enjoy them; for they shall go 3212-4 into captivity. 7628

28:42 All thy trees 6086 and fruit 6529 of thy land 127 shall the locust 6767 consume. 3423-17

28:43 The stranger 1616 that [is] within 7130 thee shall get up 5927-4 above thee very 4605 high; 4605 and thou shalt come down 3381-4 very 4295 low. 4295

28:44 He shall lend 3867-55 to thee, and thou shalt not lend 3867-55 to him: he shall be the head, 7218 and thou shalt be the tail. 2180

28:45 Moreover all these curses 7045 shall come 935-1 upon thee, and shall pursue 7291-1 thee, and overtake 5381-52 thee, till thou be destroyed; 8045-9 because thou hearkenedst 8085-1 not unto the voice 6963 of the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 to keep 8104-2 his commandments 4687 and his statutes 2708 which he commanded 6680-14 thee:

28:46 And they shall be upon thee for a sign 226 and for a wonder, 4159 and upon thy seed 2233 for 5704 ever. 5769

28:47 Because thou servedst 5647-1 not the LORD 3068 thy God 430 with joyfulness, 8057 and with gladness 2898 of heart, 3824 for the abundance 7230 of all [things];

28:48 Therefore shalt thou serve 5647-1 thine enemies 341-6 which the LORD 3068 shall send 7971-17 against thee, in hunger, 7458 and in thirst, 6772 and in nakedness, 5903 and in want 2640 of all [things]: and he shall put 5414-1 a yoke 5923 of iron 1270 upon thy neck, 6677 until he have destroyed 8045-53 thee.

28:49 The LORD 3068 shall bring 5375-4 a nation 1471 against thee from far, 7350 from the end 7097 of the earth, 776 [as swift] as the eagle 5404 flieth; 1675-4 a nation 1471 whose tongue 3956 thou shalt not understand; 8085-4

28:50 A nation 1471 of fierce 5794 countenance, 6440 which shall not regard 5375-4 the person 6440 of the old, 2205 nor shew favour 2603-4 to the young: 5288

28:51 And he shall eat 398-1 the fruit 6529 of thy cattle, 929 and the fruit 6529 of thy land, 127 until thou be destroyed: 8045-9 which [also] shall not leave 7604-55 thee [either] corn, 1715 wine, 8492 or oil, 3323 [or] the increase 7698 of thy kine, 504 or flocks 6251 of thy sheep, 6629 until he have destroyed 6-53 thee.

28:52 And he shall besiege 6887-52 thee in all thy gates, 8179 until thy high 1364 and fenced 1219-7 walls 2346 come down, 3381-2 wherein 2004 thou trustedst, 982-6 throughout all thy land: 776 and he shall besiege 6887-52 thee in all thy gates 8179 throughout all thy land, 776 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 hath given 5414-1 thee.

28:53 And thou shalt eat 398-1 the fruit 6529 of thine own body, 990 the flesh 1320 of thy sons 1121 and of thy daughters, 1323 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 hath given 5414-1 thee, in the siege, 4692 and in the straitness, 4689 wherewith thine enemies 341-6 shall distress 6693-55 thee:

28:54 [So that] the man 376 [that is] tender 7390 among you, and very 3966 delicate, 6028 his eye 5869 shall be evil 3415-4 toward his brother, 251 and toward the wife 802 of his bosom, 2436 and toward the remnant 3499 of his children 1121 which he shall leave: 3498-55

28:55 So that he will not give 5414-2 to any 259 of them of the flesh 1320 of his children 1121 whom he shall eat: 398-4 because he hath nothing left 7604-52 him in the siege, 4692 and in the straitness, 4689 wherewith thine enemies 341-6 shall distress 6693-55 thee in all thy gates. 8179

28:56 The tender 7390 and delicate 6028 woman among you, which would not adventure 5254-14 to set 3322-53 the sole 3709 of her foot 7272 upon the ground 776 for delicateness 6026-99 and tenderness, 7391 her eye 5869 shall be evil 3415-4 toward the husband 376 of her bosom, 2436 and toward her son, 1121 and toward her daughter, 1323

28:57 And toward her young one 7988 that cometh out 3318-6 from between her feet, 7272 and toward her children 1121 which she shall bear: 3205-4 for she shall eat 398-4 them for want 2640 of all [things] secretly 5643 in the siege 4692 and straitness, 4689 wherewith thine enemy 341-6 shall distress 6693-55 thee in thy gates. 8179

28:58 If thou wilt not observe 8104-4 to do 6213-2 all the words 1697 of this law 8451 that are written 3789-7 in this book, 5612 that thou mayest fear 3372-2 this glorious 3513-12 and fearful 3372-12 name, 8034 THE LORD 3068 THY GOD; 430

28:59 Then the LORD 3068 will make thy plagues 4347 wonderful, 6381-52 and the plagues 4347 of thy seed, 2233 [even] great 1419 plagues, 4347 and of long continuance, 539-12 and sore 7451 sicknesses, 2483 and of long continuance. 539-12

28:60 Moreover he will bring 7725-52 upon thee all the diseases 4064 of Egypt, 4714 which thou wast afraid 3025-1 of; 6440 and they shall cleave 1692-1 unto thee.

28:61 Also every sickness, 2483 and every plague, 4347 which [is] not written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of this law, 8451 them will the LORD 3068 bring 5927-55 upon thee, until thou be destroyed. 8045-9

28:62 And ye shall be left 7604-8 few 4592 in number, 4962 whereas 834 ye were as the stars 3556 of heaven 8064 for multitude; 7230 because thou wouldest not obey 8085-1 the voice 6963 of the LORD 3068 thy God. 430

28:63 And it shall come to pass, [that] as the LORD 3068 rejoiced 7797-1 over you to do you good, 3190-53 and to multiply 7235-53 you; so the LORD 3068 will rejoice 7797-4 over you to destroy 6-53 you, and to bring you to nought; 8045-53 and ye shall be plucked 5255-8 from off the land 127 whither thou goest 935-6 to possess 3423-2 it.

28:64 And the LORD 3068 shall scatter 6327-52 thee among all people, 5971 from the one end 7097 of the earth 776 even unto the other; 7097 776 and there thou shalt serve 5647-1 other 312 gods, 430 which neither thou nor thy fathers 1 have known, 3045-1 [even] wood 6086 and stone. 68

28:65 And among these 1992 nations 1471 shalt thou find no ease, 7280-55 neither shall the sole 3709 of thy foot 7272 have rest: 4494 but the LORD 3068 shall give 5414-1 thee there a trembling 7268 heart, 3820 and failing 3631 of eyes, 5869 and sorrow 1671 of mind: 5315

28:66 And thy life 2416 shall hang 8511-7 in doubt before 5048 thee; and thou shalt fear 6342-1 day 3119 and night, 3915 and shalt have none assurance 539-55 of thy life: 2416

28:67 In the morning 1242 thou shalt say, 559-4 Would God 5414-4 it were even! 6153 and at even 6153 thou shalt say, 559-4 Would God 5414-4 it were morning! 1242 for the fear 6343 of thine heart 3824 wherewith thou shalt fear, 6342-4 and for the sight 4758 of thine eyes 5869 which thou shalt see. 7200-4

28:68 And the LORD 3068 shall bring thee into Egypt 4714 again 7725-52 with ships, 591 by the way 1870 whereof I spake 559-1 unto thee, Thou shalt see 7200-2 it no more 3254-55 again: and there ye shall be sold 4376-98 unto your enemies 341-6 for bondmen 5650 and bondwomen, 8198 and no man shall buy 7069-6 [you].

29:1 These [are] the words 1697 of the covenant, 1285 which the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses 4872 to make 3772-2 with the children 1121 of Israel 3478 in the land 776 of Moab, 4124 beside the covenant 1285 which he made 3772-1 with them in Horeb. 2722

29:2 And Moses 4872 called 7121-4 unto all Israel, 3478 and said 559-4 unto them, Ye have seen 7200-1 all that the LORD 3068 did 6213-1 before your eyes 5869 in the land 776 of Egypt 4714 unto Pharaoh, 6547 and unto all his servants, 5650 and unto all his land; 776

29:3 The great 1419 temptations 4531 which thine eyes 5869 have seen, 7200-1 the signs, 226 and those great 1419 miracles: 4159

29:4 Yet the LORD 3068 hath not given 5414-1 you an heart 3820 to perceive, 3045-2 and eyes 5869 to see, 7200-2 and ears 241 to hear, 8085-2 unto this day. 3117

29:5 And I have led 3212-55 you forty 705 years 8141 in the wilderness: 4057 your clothes 8008 are not waxen old 1086-1 upon you, and thy shoe 5275 is not waxen old 1086-1 upon thy foot. 7272

29:6 Ye have not eaten 398-1 bread, 3899 neither have ye drunk 8354-1 wine 3196 or strong drink: 7941 that ye might know 3045-4 that I [am] the LORD 3068 your God. 430

29:7 And when ye came 935-4 unto this place, 4725 Sihon 5511 the king 4428 of Heshbon, 2809 and Og 5747 the king 4428 of Bashan, 1316 came out 3318-4 against 7125-2 us unto battle, 4421 and we smote 5221-55 them:

29:8 And we took 3947-4 their land, 776 and gave 5414-4 it for an inheritance 5159 unto the Reubenites, 7206 and to the Gadites, 1425 and to the half 2677 tribe 7626 of Manasseh. 4520

29:9 Keep 8104-1 therefore the words 1697 of this covenant, 1285 and do 6213-1 them, that ye may prosper 7919-55 in all that ye do. 6213-4

29:10 Ye stand 5324-12 this day 3117 all of you before 6440 the LORD 3068 your God; 430 your captains 7218 of your tribes, 7626 your elders, 2205 and your officers, 7860-6 [with] all the men 376 of Israel, 3478

29:11 Your little ones, 2945 your wives, 802 and thy stranger 1616 that [is] in 7130 thy camp, 4264 from the hewer 2404-6 of thy wood 6086 unto the drawer 7579-6 of thy water: 4325

29:12 That thou shouldest enter 5674-2 into covenant 1285 with the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 and into his oath, 423 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 maketh 3772-6 with thee this day: 3117

29:13 That he may establish 6965-53 thee to day 3117 for a people 5971 unto himself, and [that] he may be unto thee a God, 430 as he hath said 1696-14 unto thee, and as he hath sworn 7650-8 unto thy fathers, 1 to Abraham, 85 to Isaac, 3327 and to Jacob. 3290

29:14 Neither with you only do I make 3772-6 this covenant 1285 and this oath; 423

29:15 But with [him] that 3426 standeth 5975-6 here with us this day 3117 before 6440 the LORD 3068 our God, 430 and also with [him] that [is] not here with us this day: 3117

29:16 (For ye know 3045-1 how we have dwelt 3427-1 in the land 776 of Egypt; 4714 and how we came 5674-1 through 7130 the nations 1471 which ye passed by; 5674-1

29:17 And ye have seen 7200-4 their abominations, 8251 and their idols, 1544 wood 6086 and stone, 68 silver 3701 and gold, 2091 which [were] among them:)

29:18 Lest there should be 3426 among you man, 376 or woman, 802 or family, 4940 or tribe, 7626 whose heart 3824 turneth away 6437-6 this day 3117 from the LORD 3068 our God, 430 to go 3212-2 [and] serve 5647-2 the gods 430 of these nations; 1471 lest there should be 3426 among you a root 8328 that beareth 6509-6 gall 7219 and wormwood; 3939

29:19 And it come to pass, when he heareth 8085-2 the words 1697 of this curse, 423 that he bless 1288-98 himself in his heart, 3824 saying, 559-2 I shall have peace, 7965 though 3588 I walk 3212-4 in the imagination 8307 of mine heart, 3820 to add 5595-2 drunkenness 7302 to thirst: 6771

29:20 The LORD 3068 will 14-4 not spare 5545-2 him, but then the anger 639 of the LORD 3068 and his jealousy 7068 shall smoke 6225-4 against that man, 376 and all the curses 423 that are written 3789-7 in this book 5612 shall lie 7257-1 upon him, and the LORD 3068 shall blot out 4229-1 his name 8034 from under heaven. 8064

29:21 And the LORD 3068 shall separate 914-52 him unto evil 7451 out of all the tribes 7626 of Israel, 3478 according to all the curses 423 of the covenant 1285 that are written 3789-7 in this book 5612 of the law: 8451

29:22 So that the generation 1755 to come 314 of your children 1121 that shall rise up 6965-4 after 310 you, and the stranger 5237 that shall come 935-4 from a far 7350 land, 776 shall say, 559-1 when they see 7200-1 the plagues 4347 of that land, 776 and the sicknesses 8463 which the LORD 3068 hath laid 2470-14 upon it;

29:23 [And that] the whole land 776 thereof [is] brimstone, 1614 and salt, 4417 [and] burning, 8316 [that] it is not sown, 2232-11 nor beareth, 6779-55 nor any grass 6212 groweth 5927-4 therein, like the overthrow 4114 of Sodom, 5467 and Gomorrah, 6017 Admah, 126 and Zeboim, 6636 which the LORD 3068 overthrew 2015-1 in his anger, 639 and in his wrath: 2534

29:24 Even all nations 1471 shall say, 559-1 Wherefore hath the LORD 3068 done 6213-1 thus unto this land? 776 what [meaneth] the heat 2750 of this great 1419 anger? 639

29:25 Then men shall say, 559-1 Because they have forsaken 5800-1 the covenant 1285 of the LORD 3068 God 430 of their fathers, 1 which he made 3772-1 with them when he brought them forth 3318-53 out of the land 776 of Egypt: 4714

29:26 For they went 3212-4 and served 5647-4 other 312 gods, 430 and worshipped 7812-101 them, gods 430 whom they knew 3045-1 not, and [whom] he had not given 2505-1 unto them:

29:27 And the anger 639 of the LORD 3068 was kindled 2734-4 against this land, 776 to bring 935-53 upon it all the curses 7045 that are written 3789-7 in this book: 5612

29:28 And the LORD 3068 rooted them out 5428-4 of their land 127 in anger, 639 and in wrath, 2534 and in great 1419 indignation, 7110 and cast 7993-55 them into another 312 land, 776 as [it is] this day. 3117

29:29 The secret 5641-12 [things belong] unto the LORD 3068 our God: 430 but those [things which are] revealed 1540-12 [belong] unto us and to our children 1121 for 5704 ever, 5769 that [we] may do 6213-2 all the words 1697 of this law. 8451

30:1 And it shall come to pass, when all these things 1697 are come 935-4 upon thee, the blessing 1293 and the curse, 7045 which I have set 5414-1 before 6440 thee, and thou shalt call 7725-52 [them] to mind 3824 among all the nations, 1471 whither the LORD 3068 thy God 430 hath driven 5080-52 thee,

30:2 And shalt return 7725-1 unto the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 and shalt obey 8085-1 his voice 6963 according to all that I command 6680-18 thee this day, 3117 thou and thy children, 1121 with all thine heart, 3824 and with all thy soul; 5315

30:3 That then the LORD 3068 thy God 430 will turn 7725-1 thy captivity, 7622 and have compassion 7355-14 upon thee, and will return 7725-1 and gather 6908-14 thee from all the nations, 5971 whither the LORD 3068 thy God 430 hath scattered 6327-52 thee.

30:4 If [any] of thine be driven out 5080-12 unto the outmost 7097 [parts] of heaven, 8064 from thence will the LORD 3068 thy God 430 gather 6908-17 thee, and from thence will he fetch 3947-4 thee:

30:5 And the LORD 3068 thy God 430 will bring 935-52 thee into the land 776 which thy fathers 1 possessed, 3423-1 and thou shalt possess 3423-1 it; and he will do thee good, 3190-52 and multiply 7235-52 thee above thy fathers. 1

30:6 And the LORD 3068 thy God 430 will circumcise 4135-1 thine heart, 3824 and the heart 3824 of thy seed, 2233 to love 157-2 the LORD 3068 thy God 430 with all thine heart, 3824 and with all thy soul, 5315 that thou mayest live. 2416

30:7 And the LORD 3068 thy God 430 will put 5414-1 all these curses 423 upon thine enemies, 341-6 and on them that hate 8130-6 thee, which persecuted 7291-1 thee.

30:8 And thou shalt return 7725-4 and obey 8085-1 the voice 6963 of the LORD, 3068 and do 6213-1 all his commandments 4687 which I command 6680-18 thee this day. 3117

30:9 And the LORD 3068 thy God 430 will make thee plenteous 3498-52 in every work 4639 of thine hand, 3027 in the fruit 6529 of thy body, 990 and in the fruit 6529 of thy cattle, 929 and in the fruit 6529 of thy land, 127 for good: 2896 for the LORD 3068 will again 7725-4 rejoice 7797-2 over thee for good, 2896 as he rejoiced 7797-1 over thy fathers: 1

30:10 If thou shalt hearken 8085-4 unto the voice 6963 of the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 to keep 8104-2 his commandments 4687 and his statutes 2708 which are written 3789-7 in this book 5612 of the law, 8451 [and] if thou turn 7725-4 unto the LORD 3068 thy God 430 with all thine heart, 3824 and with all thy soul. 5315

30:11 For this commandment 4687 which I command 6680-18 thee this day, 3117 it [is] not hidden 6381-12 from thee, neither [is] it far off. 7350

30:12 It [is] not in heaven, 8064 that thou shouldest say, 559-2 Who shall go up 5927-4 for us to heaven, 8064 and bring 3947-4 it unto us, that we may hear 8085-55 it, and do 6213-4 it?

30:13 Neither [is] it beyond 5676 the sea, 3220 that thou shouldest say, 559-2 Who shall go 5674-4 over 5676 the sea 3220 for us, and bring 3947-4 it unto us, that we may hear 8085-55 it, and do 6213-4 it?

30:14 But the word 1697 [is] very 3966 nigh 7138 unto thee, in thy mouth, 6310 and in thy heart, 3824 that thou mayest do 6213-2 it.

30:15 See, 7200-3 I have set 5414-1 before 6440 thee this day 3117 life 2416 and good, 2896 and death 4194 and evil; 7451

30:16 In that I command 6680-18 thee this day 3117 to love 157-2 the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 to walk 3212-2 in his ways, 1870 and to keep 8104-2 his commandments 4687 and his statutes 2708 and his judgments, 4941 that thou mayest live 2421-1 and multiply: 7235-1 and the LORD 3068 thy God 430 shall bless 1288-14 thee in the land 776 whither thou goest 935-6 to possess 3423-2 it.

30:17 But if thine heart 3824 turn away, 6437-4 so that thou wilt not hear, 8085-4 but shalt be drawn away, 5080-8 and worship 7812-98 other 312 gods, 430 and serve 5647-1 them;

30:18 I denounce 5046-52 unto you this day, 3117 that ye shall surely 6-2 perish, 6-4 [and that] ye shall not prolong 748-55 [your] days 3117 upon the land, 127 whither thou passest over 5674-6 Jordan 3383 to go 935-2 to possess 3423-2 it.

30:19 I call heaven 8064 and earth 776 to record 5749-52 this day 3117 against you, [that] I have set 5414-1 before 6440 you life 2416 and death, 4194 blessing 1293 and cursing: 7045 therefore choose 977-1 life, 2416 that both thou and thy seed 2233 may live: 2421-4

30:20 That thou mayest love 157-2 the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 [and] that thou mayest obey 8085-2 his voice, 6963 and that thou mayest cleave 1692-2 unto him: for he [is] thy life, 2416 and the length 753 of thy days: 3117 that thou mayest dwell 3427-2 in the land 127 which the LORD 3068 sware 7650-8 unto thy fathers, 1 to Abraham, 85 to Isaac, 3327 and to Jacob, 3290 to give 5414-2 them.

31:1 And Moses 4872 went 3212-4 and spake 1696-17 these words 1697 unto all Israel. 3478

31:2 And he said 559-4 unto them, I [am] an hundred 3967 and twenty 6242 years 8141 old 1121 this day; 3117 I can 3201-4 no more go out 3318-2 and come in: 935-2 also the LORD 3068 hath said 559-1 unto me, Thou shalt not go over 5674-4 this Jordan. 3383

31:3 The LORD 3068 thy God, 430 he will go over 5674-6 before 6440 thee, [and] he will destroy 8045-55 these nations 1471 from before 6440 thee, and thou shalt possess 3423-1 them: [and] Joshua, 3091 he shall go over 5674-6 before 6440 thee, as the LORD 3068 hath said. 1696-14

31:4 And the LORD 3068 shall do 6213-1 unto them as he did 6213-1 to Sihon 5511 and to Og, 5747 kings 4428 of the Amorites, 567 and unto the land 776 of them, whom he destroyed. 8045-52

31:5 And the LORD 3068 shall give them up 5414-1 before your face, 6440 that ye may do 6213-1 unto them according unto all the commandments 4687 which I have commanded 6680-14 you.

31:6 Be strong 2388-3 and of a good courage, 553-3 fear 3372-4 not, nor be afraid 6206-4 of them: 6440 for the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 he [it is] that doth go 1980-6 with thee; he will not fail 7503-55 thee, nor forsake 5800-4 thee.

31:7 And Moses 4872 called 7121-4 unto Joshua, 3091 and said 559-4 unto him in the sight 5869 of all Israel, 3478 Be strong 2388-3 and of a good courage: 553-3 for thou must go 935-4 with this people 5971 unto the land 776 which the LORD 3068 hath sworn 7650-8 unto their fathers 1 to give 5414-2 them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit 5157-55 it.

31:8 And the LORD, 3068 he [it is] that doth go 1980-6 before 6440 thee; he will be with thee, he will not fail 7503-55 thee, neither forsake 5800-4 thee: fear 3372-4 not, neither be dismayed. 2865-11

31:9 And Moses 4872 wrote 3789-4 this law, 8451 and delivered 5414-4 it unto the priests 3548 the sons 1121 of Levi, 3878 which bare 5375-6 the ark 727 of the covenant 1285 of the LORD, 3068 and unto all the elders 2205 of Israel. 3478

31:10 And Moses 4872 commanded 6680-17 them, saying, 559-2 At the end 7093 of [every] seven 7651 years, 8141 in the solemnity 4150 of the year 8141 of release, 8059 in the feast 2282 of tabernacles, 5521

31:11 When all Israel 3478 is come 935-2 to appear 7200-9 before 6440 the LORD 3068 thy God 430 in the place 4725 which he shall choose, 977-4 thou shalt read 7121-4 this law 8451 before all Israel 3478 in their hearing. 241

31:12 Gather the people 5971 together, 6950-54 men, 582 and women, 802 and children, 2945 and thy stranger 1616 that [is] within thy gates, 8179 that they may hear, 8085-4 and that they may learn, 3925-4 and fear 3372-1 the LORD 3068 your God, 430 and observe 8104-1 to do 6213-2 all the words 1697 of this law: 8451

31:13 And [that] their children, 1121 which have not known 3045-1 [any thing], may hear, 8085-4 and learn 3925-1 to fear 3372-2 the LORD 3068 your God, 430 as long as 3117 ye live 2416 in the land 127 whither ye go over 5674-6 Jordan 3383 to possess 3423-2 it.

31:14 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Behold, thy days 3117 approach 7126-1 that thou must die: 4191-2 call 7121-3 Joshua, 3091 and present 3320-100 yourselves in the tabernacle 168 of the congregation, 4150 that I may give him a charge. 6680-17 And Moses 4872 and Joshua 3091 went, 3212-4 and presented 3320-101 themselves in the tabernacle 168 of the congregation. 4150

31:15 And the LORD 3068 appeared 7200-11 in the tabernacle 168 in a pillar 5982 of a cloud: 6051 and the pillar 5982 of the cloud 6051 stood 5975-4 over the door 6607 of the tabernacle. 168

31:16 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Behold, thou shalt sleep 7901-6 with thy fathers; 1 and this people 5971 will rise up, 6965-1 and go a whoring 2181-1 after 310 the gods 430 of the strangers 5236 of the land, 776 whither they go 935-6 [to be] among 7130 them, and will forsake 5800-1 me, and break 6565-52 my covenant 1285 which I have made 3772-1 with them.

31:17 Then my anger 639 shall be kindled 2734-1 against them in that day, 3117 and I will forsake 5800-1 them, and I will hide 5641-52 my face 6440 from them, and they shall be devoured, 398-2 and many 7227 evils 7451 and troubles 6869 shall befall 4672-1 them; so that they will say 559-1 in that day, 3117 Are not these evils 7451 come upon 4672-1 us, because our God 430 [is] not among 7130 us?

31:18 And I will surely 5641-53 hide 5641-55 my face 6440 in that day 3117 for all the evils 7451 which they shall have wrought, 6213-1 in that 3588 they are turned 6437-1 unto other 312 gods. 430

31:19 Now therefore write 3789-3 ye this song 7892 for you, and teach 3925-16 it the children 1121 of Israel: 3478 put 7760-3 it in their mouths, 6310 that this song 7892 may be a witness 5707 for me against the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

31:20 For when I shall have brought 935-55 them into the land 127 which I sware 7650-8 unto their fathers, 1 that floweth 2100-6 with milk 2461 and honey; 1706 and they shall have eaten 398-1 and filled 7646-1 themselves, and waxen fat; 1878-1 then will they turn 6437-1 unto other 312 gods, 430 and serve 5647-1 them, and provoke 5006-14 me, and break 6565-52 my covenant. 1285

31:21 And it shall come to pass, when many 7227 evils 7451 and troubles 6869 are befallen 4672-4 them, that this song 7892 shall testify 6030-1 against 6440 them as a witness; 5707 for it shall not be forgotten 7911-11 out of the mouths 6310 of their seed: 2233 for I know 3045-1 their imagination 3336 which they go about, 6213-6 even now, 3117 before I have brought 935-55 them into the land 776 which I sware. 7650-8

31:22 Moses 4872 therefore wrote 3789-4 this song 7892 the same day, 3117 and taught 3925-17 it the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

31:23 And he gave Joshua 3091 the son 1121 of Nun 5126 a charge, 6680-17 and said, 559-4 Be strong 2388-3 and of a good courage: 553-3 for thou shalt bring 935-55 the children 1121 of Israel 3478 into the land 776 which I sware 7650-8 unto them: and I will be with thee.

31:24 And it came to pass, when Moses 4872 had made an end 3615-15 of writing 3789-2 the words 1697 of this law 8451 in a book, 5612 until they were finished, 8552-2

31:25 That Moses 4872 commanded 6680-17 the Levites, 3881 which bare 5375-6 the ark 727 of the covenant 1285 of the LORD, 3068 saying, 559-2

31:26 Take 3947-2 this book 5612 of the law, 8451 and put 7760-1 it in the side 6654 of the ark 727 of the covenant 1285 of the LORD 3068 your God, 430 that it may be there for a witness 5707 against thee.

31:27 For I know 3045-1 thy rebellion, 4805 and thy stiff 7186 neck: 6203 behold, while I am yet alive 2416 with you this day, 3117 ye have been rebellious 4784-56 against the LORD; 3068 and how much more after 310 my death? 4194

31:28 Gather 6950-54 unto me all the elders 2205 of your tribes, 7626 and your officers, 7860-6 that I may speak 1696-17 these words 1697 in their ears, 241 and call heaven 8064 and earth 776 to record 5749-55 against them.

31:29 For I know 3045-1 that after 310 my death 4194 ye will utterly 7843-53 corrupt 7843-55 [yourselves], and turn aside 5493-1 from the way 1870 which I have commanded 6680-14 you; and evil 7451 will befall 7122-1 you in the latter 319 days; 3117 because ye will do 6213-4 evil 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD, 3068 to provoke him to anger 3707-53 through the work 4639 of your hands. 3027

31:30 And Moses 4872 spake 1696-17 in the ears 241 of all the congregation 6951 of Israel 3478 the words 1697 of this song, 7892 until they were ended. 8552-2

32:1 Give ear, 238-54 O ye heavens, 8064 and I will speak; 1696-17 and hear, 8085-4 O earth, 776 the words 561 of my mouth. 6310

32:2 My doctrine 3948 shall drop 6201-4 as the rain, 4306 my speech 565 shall distil 5140-4 as the dew, 2919 as the small rain 8164 upon the tender herb, 1877 and as the showers 7241 upon the grass: 6212

32:3 Because I will publish 7121-4 the name 8034 of the LORD: 3068 ascribe 3051-3 ye greatness 1433 unto our God. 430

32:4 [He is] the Rock, 6697 his work 6467 [is] perfect: 8549 for all his ways 1870 [are] judgment: 4941 a God 410 of truth 530 and without iniquity, 5766 just 6662 and right 3477 [is] he.

32:5 They have corrupted 7843-14 themselves, their spot 3971 [is] not [the spot] of his children: 1121 [they are] a perverse 6141 and crooked 6618 generation. 1755

32:6 Do ye thus requite 1580-4 the LORD, 3068 O foolish 5036 people 5971 and unwise? 2450 [is] not he thy father 1 [that] hath bought 7069-1 thee? hath he not made 6213-1 thee, and established 3559-34 thee?

32:7 Remember 2142-3 the days 3117 of old, 5769 consider 995-3 the years 8141 of many 1755 generations: 1755 ask 7592-3 thy father, 1 and he will shew 5046-55 thee; thy elders, 2205 and they will tell 559-4 thee.

32:8 When the most High 5945 divided to the nations 1471 their inheritance, 5157-53 when he separated 6504-53 the sons 1121 of Adam, 120 he set 5324-55 the bounds 1367 of the people 5971 according to the number 4557 of the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

32:9 For the LORD'S 3068 portion 2506 [is] his people; 5971 Jacob 3290 [is] the lot 2256 of his inheritance. 5159

32:10 He found 4672-4 him in a desert 4057 land, 776 and in the waste 8414 howling 3214 wilderness; 3452 he led him about, 5437-25 he instructed 995-34 him, he kept 5341-4 him as the apple 380 of his eye. 5869

32:11 As an eagle 5404 stirreth up 5782-55 her nest, 7064 fluttereth 7363-17 over her young, 1469 spreadeth abroad 6566-4 her wings, 3671 taketh 3947-4 them, beareth 5375-4 them on her wings: 84

32:12 [So] the LORD 3068 alone 910 did lead 5148-55 him, and [there was] no strange 5236 god 410 with him.

32:13 He made him ride 7392-55 on the high places 1116 of the earth, 776 that he might eat 398-4 the increase 8570 of the fields; 7704 and he made him to suck 3243-55 honey 1706 out of the rock, 5553 and oil 8081 out of the flinty 2496 rock; 6697

32:14 Butter 2529 of kine, 1241 and milk 2461 of sheep, 6629 with fat 2459 of lambs, 3733 and rams 352 of the breed 1121 of Bashan, 1316 and goats, 6260 with the fat 2459 of kidneys 3629 of wheat; 2406 and thou didst drink 8354-4 the pure 2561 blood 1818 of the grape. 6025

32:15 But Jeshurun 3484 waxed fat, 8080-4 and kicked: 1163-4 thou art waxen fat, 8080-1 thou art grown thick, 5666-1 thou art covered 3780-1 [with fatness]; then he forsook 5203-4 God 433 [which] made 6213-1 him, and lightly esteemed 5034-17 the Rock 6697 of his salvation. 3444

32:16 They provoked him to jealousy 7065-55 with strange 2114-5 [gods], with abominations 8441 provoked they him to anger. 3707-55

32:17 They sacrificed 2076-4 unto devils, 7700 not to God; 433 to gods 430 whom they knew 3045-1 not, to new 2319 [gods that] came 935-1 newly 7138 up, whom your fathers 1 feared 8175-1 not.

32:18 Of the Rock 6697 [that] begat 3205-1 thee thou art unmindful, 7876-4 and hast forgotten 7911-4 God 410 that formed 2342-35 thee.

32:19 And when the LORD 3068 saw 7200-4 [it], he abhorred 5006-4 [them], because of the provoking 3708 of his sons, 1121 and of his daughters. 1323

32:20 And he said, 559-4 I will hide 5641-55 my face 6440 from them, I will see 7200-4 what their end 319 [shall be]: for they [are] a very froward 8419 generation, 1755 children 1121 in whom [is] no faith. 529

32:21 They have moved me to jealousy 7065-14 with [that which is] not 3808 God; 410 they have provoked me to anger 3707-14 with their vanities: 1892 and I will move them to jealousy 7065-55 with [those which are] not a people; 5971 I will provoke them to anger 3707-55 with a foolish 5036 nation. 1471

32:22 For a fire 784 is kindled 6919-1 in mine anger, 639 and shall burn 3344-4 unto the lowest 8482 hell, 7585 and shall consume 398-4 the earth 776 with her increase, 2981 and set on fire 3857-17 the foundations 4144 of the mountains. 2022

32:23 I will heap 5595-55 mischiefs 7451 upon them; I will spend 3615-17 mine arrows 2671 upon them.

32:24 [They shall be] burnt 4198 with hunger, 7458 and devoured 3898-7 with burning heat, 7565 and with bitter 4815 destruction: 6986 I will also send 7971-17 the teeth 8127 of beasts 929 upon them, with the poison 2534 of serpents 2119-5 of the dust. 6083

32:25 The sword 2719 without, 2351 and terror 367 within, 2315 shall destroy 7921-17 both the young man 970 and the virgin, 1330 the suckling 3243-6 [also] with the man 376 of gray hairs. 7872

32:26 I said, 559-1 I would scatter them into corners, 6284-55 I would make the remembrance 2143 of them to cease 7673-55 from among men: 582

32:27 Were it not that 3884 I feared 1481-4 the wrath 3708 of the enemy, 341-6 lest their adversaries 6862 should behave themselves strangely, 5234-17 [and] lest they should say, 559-4 Our hand 3027 [is] high, 7311-1 and the LORD 3068 hath not done 6466-1 all this.

32:28 For they [are] a nation 1471 void 6-6 of counsel, 6098 neither [is there any] understanding 8394 in them.

32:29 O that 3863 they were wise, 2449-1 [that] they understood 7919-55 this, [that] they would consider 995-4 their latter end! 319

32:30 How should one 259 chase 7291-4 a thousand, 505 and two 8147 put ten thousand 7233 505 to flight, 5127-55 except 3808 3588 their Rock 6697 had sold 4376-1 them, and the LORD 3068 had shut them up? 5462-52

32:31 For their rock 6697 [is] not as our Rock, 6697 even our enemies 341-6 themselves [being] judges. 6414

32:32 For their vine 1612 [is] of the vine 1612 of Sodom, 5467 and of the fields 7709 of Gomorrah: 6017 their grapes 6025 [are] grapes 6025 of gall, 7219 their clusters 811 [are] bitter: 4846

32:33 Their wine 3196 [is] the poison 2534 of dragons, 8577 and the cruel 393 venom 7219 of asps. 6620

32:34 [Is] not this laid up in store 3647-7 with me, [and] sealed up 2856-7 among my treasures? 214

32:35 To me [belongeth] vengeance, 5359 and recompence; 8005 their foot 7272 shall slide 4131-4 in [due] time: 6256 for the day 3117 of their calamity 343 [is] at hand, 7138 and the things that shall come 6264 upon them make haste. 2363-1

32:36 For the LORD 3068 shall judge 1777-4 his people, 5971 and repent 5162-101 himself for his servants, 5650 when he seeth 7200-4 that [their] power 3027 is gone, 235-1 and [there is] none 657 shut up, 6113-7 or left. 5800-7

32:37 And he shall say, 559-1 Where [are] their gods, 430 [their] rock 6697 in whom they trusted, 2620-1

32:38 Which did eat 398-4 the fat 2459 of their sacrifices, 2077 [and] drank 8354-4 the wine 3196 of their drink offerings? 5257 let them rise up 6965-4 and help 5826-4 you, [and] be your protection. 5643

32:39 See 7200-3 now that I, [even] I, [am] he, and [there is] no god 430 with me: I kill, 4191-55 and I make alive; 2421-17 I wound, 4272-1 and I heal: 7495-4 neither [is there any] that can deliver 5337-56 out of my hand. 3027

32:40 For I lift up 5375-4 my hand 3027 to heaven, 8064 and say, 559-1 I live 2416 for ever. 5769

32:41 If I whet 8150-1 my glittering 1300 sword, 2719 and mine hand 3027 take hold 270-4 on judgment; 4941 I will render 7725-55 vengeance 5359 to mine enemies, 6862 and will reward 7999-17 them that hate 8130-18 me.

32:42 I will make mine arrows 2671 drunk 7937-55 with blood, 1818 and my sword 2719 shall devour 398-4 flesh; 1320 [and that] with the blood 1818 of the slain 2491 and of the captives, 7633 from the beginning 7218 of revenges 6546 upon the enemy. 341-6

32:43 Rejoice, 7442-54 O ye nations, 1471 [with] his people: 5971 for he will avenge 5358-4 the blood 1818 of his servants, 5650 and will render 7725-55 vengeance 5359 to his adversaries, 6862 and will be merciful 3722-14 unto his land, 127 [and] to his people. 5971

32:44 And Moses 4872 came 935-4 and spake 1696-17 all the words 1697 of this song 7892 in the ears 241 of the people, 5971 he, and Hoshea 1954 the son 1121 of Nun. 5126

32:45 And Moses 4872 made an end 3615-17 of speaking 1696-15 all these words 1697 to all Israel: 3478

32:46 And he said 559-4 unto them, Set 7760-3 your hearts 3824 unto all the words 1697 which I testify 5749-56 among you this day, 3117 which ye shall command 6680-17 your children 1121 to observe 8104-2 to do, 6213-2 all the words 1697 of this law. 8451

32:47 For it [is] not a vain 7386 thing 1697 for you; because it [is] your life: 2416 and through this thing 1697 ye shall prolong 748-55 [your] days 3117 in the land, 127 whither ye go over 5674-6 Jordan 3383 to possess 3423-2 it.

32:48 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses 4872 that selfsame 6106 day, 3117 saying, 559-2

32:49 Get thee up 5927-3 into this mountain 2022 Abarim, 5682 [unto] mount 2022 Nebo, 5015 which [is] in the land 776 of Moab, 4124 that [is] over against 6440 Jericho; 3405 and behold 7200-3 the land 776 of Canaan, 3667 which I give 5414-6 unto the children 1121 of Israel 3478 for a possession: 272

32:50 And die 4191-3 in the mount 2022 whither thou goest up, 5927-6 and be gathered 622-10 unto thy people; 5971 as Aaron 175 thy brother 251 died 4191-1 in mount 2022 Hor, 2023 and was gathered 622-11 unto his people: 5971

32:51 Because ye trespassed 4603-1 against me among 8432 the children 1121 of Israel 3478 at the waters 4325 of Meribah-Kadesh, 4809|4808|6946 in the wilderness 4057 of Zin; 6790 because ye sanctified 6942-14 me not in the midst 8432 of the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

32:52 Yet thou shalt see 7200-4 the land 776 before [thee]; but thou shalt not go 935-4 thither unto the land 776 which I give 5414-6 the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

33:1 And this [is] the blessing, 1293 wherewith Moses 4872 the man 376 of God 430 blessed 1288-14 the children 1121 of Israel 3478 before 6440 his death. 4194

33:2 And he said, 559-4 The LORD 3068 came 935-1 from Sinai, 5514 and rose up 2224-1 from Seir 8165 unto them; he shined forth 3313-52 from mount 2022 Paran, 6290 and he came 857-1 with ten thousands 7233 of saints: 6944 from his right hand 3225 [went] a fiery law 784|1881|799 for them.

33:3 Yea, 637 he loved 2245-5 the people; 5971 all his saints 6918 [are] in thy hand: 3027 and they sat down 8497-27 at thy feet; 7272 [every one] shall receive 5375-4 of thy words. 1703

33:4 Moses 4872 commanded 6680-14 us a law, 8451 [even] the inheritance 4181 of the congregation 6952 of Jacob. 3290

33:5 And he was king 4428 in Jeshurun, 3484 when the heads 7218 of the people 5971 [and] the tribes 7626 of Israel 3478 were gathered 622-99 together. 3162

33:6 Let Reuben 7205 live, 2421-4 and not die; 4191-4 and let [not] his men 4962 be few. 4557

33:7 And this [is the blessing] of Judah: 3063 and he said, 559-4 Hear, 8085-3 LORD, 3068 the voice 6963 of Judah, 3063 and bring 935-55 him unto his people: 5971 let his hands 3027 be sufficient 7227 for him; and be thou an help 5828 [to him] from his enemies. 6862

33:8 And of Levi 3878 he said, 559-1 [Let] thy Thummim 8550 and thy Urim 224 [be] with thy holy 2623 one, 376 whom thou didst prove 5254-14 at Massah, 4532 [and with] whom thou didst strive 7378-4 at the waters 4325 of Meribah; 4809

33:9 Who said 559-6 unto his father 1 and to his mother, 517 I have not seen 7200-1 him; neither did he acknowledge 5234-52 his brethren, 251 nor knew 3045-1 his own children: 1121 for they have observed 8104-1 thy word, 565 and kept 5341-4 thy covenant. 1285

33:10 They shall teach 3384-55 Jacob 3290 thy judgments, 4941 and Israel 3478 thy law: 8451 they shall put 7760-4 incense 6988 before thee, 639 and whole 3632 burnt sacrifice upon thine altar. 4196

33:11 Bless, 1288-16 LORD, 3068 his substance, 2428 and accept 7521-4 the work 6467 of his hands: 3027 smite 4272-3 through the loins 4975 of them that rise 6965-5 against him, and of them that hate 8130-18 him, that they rise 6965-4 not 4480 again.

33:12 [And] of Benjamin 1144 he said, 559-1 The beloved 3039 of the LORD 3068 shall dwell 7931-4 in safety 983 by him; [and the LORD] shall cover 2653-6 him all the day 3117 long, and he shall dwell 7931-1 between his shoulders. 3802

33:13 And of Joseph 3130 he said, 559-1 Blessed 1288-30 of the LORD 3068 [be] his land, 776 for the precious things 4022 of heaven, 8064 for the dew, 2919 and for the deep 8415 that coucheth 7257-6 beneath,

33:14 And for the precious 4022 fruits 8393 [brought forth] by the sun, 8121 and for the precious things 4022 put forth 1645 by the moon, 3391

33:15 And for the chief things 7218 of the ancient 6924 mountains, 2042 and for the precious things 4022 of the lasting 5769 hills, 1389

33:16 And for the precious things 4022 of the earth 776 and fulness 4393 thereof, and [for] the good will 7522 of him that dwelt 7931-6 in the bush: 5572 let [the blessing] come 935-4 upon the head 7218 of Joseph, 3130 and upon the top of the head 6936 of him [that was] separated 5139 from his brethren. 251

33:17 His glory 1926 [is like] the firstling 1060 of his bullock, 7794 and his horns 7161 [are like] the horns 7161 of unicorns: 7214 with them he shall push 5055-17 the people 5971 together 3162 to the ends 657 of the earth: 776 and they [are] the ten thousands 7233 of Ephraim, 669 and they [are] the thousands 505 of Manasseh. 4519

33:18 And of Zebulun 2074 he said, 559-1 Rejoice, 8055-3 Zebulun, 2074 in thy going out; 3318-2 and, Issachar, 3485 in thy tents. 168

33:19 They shall call 7121-4 the people 5971 unto the mountain; 2022 there they shall offer 2076-4 sacrifices 2077 of righteousness: 6664 for they shall suck 3243-4 [of] the abundance 8228 of the seas, 3220 and [of] treasures 8226-7 hid 2934-7 in the sand. 2344

33:20 And of Gad 1410 he said, 559-1 Blessed 1288-7 [be] he that enlargeth 7337-56 Gad: 1410 he dwelleth 7931-1 as a lion, 3833 and teareth 2963-1 the arm 2220 with 637 the crown of the head. 6936

33:21 And he provided 7200-4 the first part 7225 for himself, because there, [in] a portion 2513 of the lawgiver, 2710-26 [was he] seated; 5603-7 and he came 857-4 with the heads 7218 of the people, 5971 he executed 6213-1 the justice 6666 of the LORD, 3068 and his judgments 4941 with Israel. 3478

33:22 And of Dan 1835 he said, 559-1 Dan 1835 [is] a lion's 738 whelp: 1484 he shall leap 2187-17 from Bashan. 1316

33:23 And of Naphtali 5321 he said, 559-1 O Naphtali, 5321 satisfied 7649 with favour, 7522 and full 4392 with the blessing 1293 of the LORD: 3068 possess 3423-3 thou the west 3220 and the south. 1864

33:24 And of Asher 836 he said, 559-1 [Let] Asher 836 [be] blessed 1288-7 with children; 1121 let him be acceptable 7521-7 to his brethren, 251 and let him dip 2881-6 his foot 7272 in oil. 8081

33:25 Thy shoes 4515 [shall be] iron 1270 and brass; 5178 and as thy days, 3117 [so shall] thy strength 1679 [be].

33:26 [There is] none like unto the God 410 of Jeshurun, 3484 [who] rideth 7392-6 upon the heaven 8064 in thy help, 5828 and in his excellency 1346 on the sky. 7834

33:27 The eternal 6924 God 430 [is thy] refuge, 4585 and underneath [are] the everlasting 5769 arms: 2220 and he shall thrust out 1644-17 the enemy 341-6 from before 6440 thee; and shall say, 559-4 Destroy 8045-54 [them].

33:28 Israel 3478 then shall dwell 7931-4 in safety 983 alone: 910 the fountain 5869 of Jacob 3290 [shall be] upon a land 776 of corn 1715 and wine; 8492 also his heavens 8064 shall drop down 6201-4 dew. 2919

33:29 Happy 835 [art] thou, O Israel: 3478 who [is] like unto thee, O people 5971 saved 3467-12 by the LORD, 3068 the shield 4043 of thy help, 5828 and who [is] the sword 2719 of thy excellency! 1346 and thine enemies 341-6 shall be found liars 3584-11 unto thee; and thou shalt tread 1869-4 upon their high places. 1116

34:1 And Moses 4872 went up 5927-4 from the plains 6160 of Moab 4124 unto the mountain 2022 of Nebo, 5015 to the top 7218 of Pisgah, 6449 that [is] over against 6440 Jericho. 3405 And the LORD 3068 shewed 7200-55 him all the land 776 of Gilead, 1568 unto Dan, 1835

34:2 And all Naphtali, 5321 and the land 776 of Ephraim, 669 and Manasseh, 4519 and all the land 776 of Judah, 3063 unto the utmost 314 sea, 3220

34:3 And the south, 5045 and the plain 3603 of the valley 1237 of Jericho, 3405 the city of palm trees, 5892|8558|5899 unto Zoar. 6820

34:4 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto him, This [is] the land 776 which I sware 7650-8 unto Abraham, 85 unto Isaac, 3327 and unto Jacob, 3290 saying, 559-2 I will give 5414-4 it unto thy seed: 2233 I have caused thee to see 7200-52 [it] with thine eyes, 5869 but thou shalt not go over 5674-4 thither.

34:5 So Moses 4872 the servant 5650 of the LORD 3068 died 4191-4 there in the land 776 of Moab, 4124 according to the word 6310 of the LORD. 3068

34:6 And he buried 6912-4 him in a valley 1516 in the land 776 of Moab, 4124 over against 4136 Bethpeor: 1047 but no man 376 knoweth 3045-1 of his sepulchre 6900 unto this day. 3117

34:7 And Moses 4872 [was] an hundred 3967 and twenty 6242 years 8141 old 1121 when he died: 4194 his eye 5869 was not dim, 3543-1 nor his natural force 3893 abated. 5127-1

34:8 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 wept 1058-4 for Moses 4872 in the plains 6160 of Moab 4124 thirty 7970 days: 3117 so the days 3117 of weeping 1065 [and] mourning 60 for Moses 4872 were ended. 8552-4

34:9 And Joshua 3091 the son 1121 of Nun 5126 was full 4392 of the spirit 7307 of wisdom; 2451 for Moses 4872 had laid 5564-1 his hands 3027 upon him: and the children 1121 of Israel 3478 hearkened 8085-4 unto him, and did 6213-4 as the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses. 4872

34:10 And there arose 6965-1 not a prophet 5030 since 5750 in Israel 3478 like unto Moses, 4872 whom the LORD 3068 knew 3045-1 face 6440 to face, 6440

34:11 In all the signs 226 and the wonders, 4159 which the LORD 3068 sent 7971-1 him to do 6213-2 in the land 776 of Egypt 4714 to Pharaoh, 6547 and to all his servants, 5650 and to all his land, 776

34:12 And in all that mighty 2389 hand, 3027 and in all the great 1419 terror 4172 which Moses 4872 shewed 6213-1 in the sight 5869 of all Israel. 3478
